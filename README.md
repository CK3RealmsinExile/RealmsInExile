## LotR: Realms in Exile
A total overhaul mod for Crusader Kings III, based on the works of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings.

## Developing
The Realms in Exile team is scouting for modders, artists and writers. If you are enthusiastic about LotR and Paradox Interactive's Crusader Kings III, then we would love for you to join our team. Your contribution may be large or small, every single character decision or sprawling event tree will help to fill in the spaces between the words. Your passion might be in the Realms in Exile (who are Gondor, Arnor and Umbar), the Horse Lords of Rohan, the retaking of Moria by Balin, or perhaps further afield in distant Khand or frozen Forodwaith.

If you are interested then we have a role for you. You can contribute here on GitHub by making a fork and a pull request or showcase it on our [Realms in Exile Discord](https://discord.gg/FKr4Zbr) community.
