#################################### THE DUKE AND THE BODENSEE ######################################
#																									#
# The Duke of Swabia sat by the shores of the Bodensee with his fishing rod for many months without #
# reward. He had even put a lovely slice of dove pie on the hook, but his bucket remained empty.	#
# "Are there no characters in the lake?" he thought to himself and sighed. "At this rate, my court 	#
# will become desolate within a generation! My heir will have no diligent councillors, no brave 	#
# knights, and no wise crones to help him rule the lands!" 											#		
#																									#
# The Duke cried for a long, long while, and then stood up to gathering his things.					#
# "Thank God!" he suddenly exclaimed. "I have an idea!"												#
# If the lake was empty, could he not create some new characters and release them into the waters?  #
# If some of them married, the Bodensee would surely be repopulated in just a few years!			#
#																									#
# The clever Duke quickly got to work. He made maidens and adventurers, matrons and fools. Young	#
# and old he made them, weak and strong, wicked and pious. The sun rose in the sky and set again.	#
# Under the light of moon and stars, the Duke put the final touch on his creation. 					#
#																									#
# The next morning, he gently released the little characters into the waters. He watched them swim 	#
# away with tears of happiness trailing down his whiskered cheeks. This was farewell, but he was 	#
# certain - they would not be gone for long.														#
#																									#
# And this is the story behind why pools spawn new characters for the royal courts all over the 	#
# world. Whenever we throw our hook into the depths, we send a thought of gratitude to the noble 	#
# Duke of Swabia, and his marvelous creation.														#
