	#	Bilbo with the Ring (111 birthday in 3001)	
	#	King Bain (King Bard (the Bowman) would be more interesting)	
	#	Sauron in Mordor

	# Other potential dates.		
	#	Closer to WotR date 11361.9.23 Gandalf leaves Rohan. Frodo leaves Bag End.	
	#	WotR itself will need to be extended to about 10-30 years ingame.	
	#	Maybe start in 3000 and kick off the events in 3010?	
	#		Have Balin still in Moria.
	#		With a smaller map Sauron will get as many event armies as he needs.
