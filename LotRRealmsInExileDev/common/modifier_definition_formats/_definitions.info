Definitions must match a code defined modifier, you cannot add new ones of your own.

The definitions let you control formatting of the modifiers. All fields are optional.

Note that game objects that generate a dynamic modifier type do require you to then add in a format definition for them, copying an existing one of the same generated group will likely give you the right formatting options.

modifier_type_name = {
	decimals = int # Defaults to 2
	color = good/neutral/bad # Defaults to bad
	
	prefix = localization_key # Defaults to none
	suffix = localization_key # Defaults to none
	negative_suffix = localization_key # Defaults to none - Used in place of the suffix for negative numbers when available
	
	format = { # List of more specific options
		percent # Should this be formatted as a % by scaling it up
		already_percent # Should this be formatted as a % and the actual value itself is already scaled up
		hidden # Should this modifier not be displayed
		no_difference_sign # Should the +/- difference sign be hidden
	}

	dlc_feature = feature_name (E.G., diverge_culture) # Only show if the user has this DLC feature
}
