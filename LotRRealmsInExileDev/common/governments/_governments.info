Allowed Modifiers
=================

Modifiers referenced by a government object can be only generic
(hardcoded) modifiers, or modifiers generated from the following
databases:
- schemes
- holdings
- lifestyles
- regions

Other generated modifiers are _not_ allowed, such as those from other
governments, men_at_arms_types, cultures, or terrain types.

###
### Currency Level Cap Explained
###
# Characters' maximum achievable levels for Prestige, Piety, Influence and Merit depend on 4 sources:
# * the default maximum level, defined in 00_define.txt
# * the list of level tiers, also defined in 00_define.txt
# * the cap specified in their government
# * the modifiers applied to the Character
#
# Considering Piety for instance, a Character's maximum Level of Devotion depends on:
# * NCharacter.DEFAULT_PIETY_LEVEL_CAP (5)
# * the list of Devotion points needed to achieve every level (NCharacter.LEVELS_PIETY), which has 8 entries
# * the default currency_level_cap.piety for a government is equal to DEFAULT_PIETY_LEVEL_CAP (5), but for Mandala governments this is set to 8.
# 		This means Characters with the Mandala government type will eventually be able to raise their maximum Level of Devotion to Godlike.
# * the relevant modifier is character_max_piety_level_add
#
# Every Character's maximum Level of Devotion starts at their default (5), but it can be increased or decreased by character_max_piety_level_add.
# However it can never be higher than the cap specified by their Government.
#
# Some fictional examples follow. Imagine that:
# * there is a followed_by_the_masses modifier that gives character_max_piety_level_add = 1
# * there is a excommunicated modifier that gives character_max_piety_level_add = -2
# * there is a god_incarnate modifier that gives character_max_piety_level_add = 10
# * the Feudal government has default Piety level cap, while the Mandala government has Piety level cap set to 8.
# * a fictional Unpious government type has a piety cap set at 3.
#
# * a Mandala ruler followed_by_the_masses will have a maximum achievable Level of Devotion of 6 (5 + 1, capped at 8 due to Mandala level cap)
# * a god_incarnate Mandala ruler will have a maximum achievable Level of Devotion of 8 (5 + 10, capped at 8 due to Mandala level cap)
# * a Feudal ruler followed_by_the_masses will have a maximum achievable Level of Devotion of 5 (5 + 1, capped at 5 due to Feudal level cap)
# * an Unpious ruler followed_by_the_masses will have a maximum achievable Level of Devotion of 3 (5 + 1, capped at 3 due to Unpious level cap)
# * an excommunicated Feudal ruler followed_by_the_masses will have a maximum achievable Level of Devotion of 4 (5 + 1 - 2)
# * an excommunicated Unpious ruler will still have a maximum achievable Level of Devotion of 3 (5 - 2, capped at 3)
# * an excommunicated Mandala ruler will have a maximum achievable Level of Devotion of 3 (5 - 2)
# * a god_incarnate excommunicated Mandala ruler will have a maximum achievable Level of Devotion of 8 (5 + 10 - 2, capped at 8)
