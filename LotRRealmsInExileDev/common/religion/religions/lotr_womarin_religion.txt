### Womarin Religion ###
# faith_utumkodur # Original cult of Utumkodur

# faith_dragon_morgoth # Khamul's cult, (Dark Fire?) with Morgoth and the 'father of dragons', and Sauron as his heir

# faith_dragon_blues # Cult of the Celestial Emperor, Utumkodur worship stapled to a traditional Valaric pantheon, with Eru as the 'Celestial Emperor', father of Heaven, preached by the Blue Wizards. All gods can take human or dragon form

# faith_children_of_utumkodur # Some branches of the Womaw faithful held that Utumkodur could take upon human form, and indeed, she had 'sons and daughters', demigods, who were the matriarchs and patriarchs of the Womaw clans. This is naturally, complete nonsense, though Utumkodur calling humans she's fond of 'son' or 'daughter', did nothing to help the rumors

# faith_nlkum_kadir #freedoms of Nlkum Kadir # Faith of the pirates of the utter south, who worship "Kadir" the sea dragon of freedom, while learning lessons from the callous "Nlkum" the sun dragon of order

# Utumkôdur the Dragon-goddess, also known as Utumkôdur the Golden, was one of the greatest Dragons to survive the First Age, akin to Ancalagon. She had left Angband even ere the War of Wrath had begun, charged with scouting and terrorizing the Far East. Upon the defeat of Morgoth, she was bereft of purpose, and wandered the far east, eventually settling in the peaks of the Orocarni. Utumkôdur could perhaps be named the wisest of the Dragons, or at least less ireful and more pragmatic in her greed and cunning.  She descended from the mountains and taught Men much of Iron, and they revered her and offered her tribute, and the Dragon-Lords and people of Wômawas Drûs ever after revered her name. The Wômaw claim that she grew to love them fiercly as her own children, though those of the West who know of Dragons look upon this with skeptisim. Whatever the truth, her aid and guidance is no myth, and the people of Wômawas Drûs grew mighty and proud under her tutelage. However, even a Dragon is not forever, and Utumkôdur died in the middle Third-Age, under suspicious circumstances

# fire was a pretty important religious symbol to the Womaw; "In fire we were baptized; by fire we are chosen; in fire we return to the Goddess", with them cremating their dead
