			#	Khrabnazerh (cult): spirit of the mountain storms.
			#		Bringer of war, death and gifts. They can appear as a Crebain with
			#		a gouged eye and a single leg.
			#	Luta-Ies (cult): horrific dark spirit of Loch Thiar, their holy-lake.
			#		The Luta-Ies is a dark Dweller, covered in a black feathery
			#		down with an oily sheen. It slumbers in a deep-water cave
			#		in the unmeasured loch.
			#	Áirthyna: harvest-lady.
			#	Tûraignth: the lord of the hunt.
			#	Gûbdha: the Smith-King. In common with the Dwarves of Dunland (Mahal, Aulë).
			#	Marek Shoglic-Gûbdha: brought to them by an emmisary of Saruon in the dark days.
			# The Dunlending druids interpret signs from the spirits via
			# sacrificing animals and in extreme circumstance, people.
			# The druids are literate in runes (as are most people who trade with
			# the Dwarves) and they will write poem and song about their lands and
			# history of Dunland.
