# The Ayanûz, (more commonly known as the Ainur, 'The Great Holy Ones') the spirits which dwelt with Iluvatar before the creation of Arda
# They were born of the mind of Iluvatar, and after him, are the first things to have come into being
# In their ranks are included:
# The Valar, greatest of the Ainur to descend into Arda
# The Maiar, the mightiest of the spirits who aligned with specific Vala in the Great Song, and chose to enter Arda to aid them
# The Spirits (Ëalar), of the same order and make of the Maiar, but generally of greatly lesser power and influence, who made their abodes throughout Arda. Some of their orders were:
	# Nermir, Spirits of Meadows and Rivers
	# Tavari or Oromandi, Spirits of Trees and Forests. Some theorize the Ents are of this order, but it does not seem likely.
	# Nandini, Spirits of Valleys
	# Orossi, Spirits of the Mountains
# Also included in this group are spirits of unknown origin (such as Tom Bombadil and Ungoliant)

# Currently included in this group
# The Úmaiar, those Maiar and greater spirits who fell and served Morgoth. Largely wiped out by the end of the First Age, the Balrogs were among the mightiest of these

# Temporarily using the Goidelic - Irish culture as a backup.
