### ORCS ###

# The origin of orcs is uncertain, a common belief being that they were created by Melkor from the corruption of Elves.
# Whatever the true origin, it is certain that they would never have existed without the influence of Melkor.
# After the banishment of Melkor by the Valar, his lieutenant Sauron continued the legacy of breeding and manipulating orcs for his own purposes.
# Whenever dominated by a powerful will, orcs became tools of evil, unable to resist due to their inherent corruption.

# However, orcs have their own unique cultures, and those that find themselves without the influence of a Dark Lord are capable of organizing under their own leadership.
# They are not unskilled smiths, miners, and builders, though they have little care for the aesthetics of their works.

# Due to a long history of targeted breeding, geographic expansion of populations, and periods of isolation they are diverse in form. 
# Generally however, they are crooked in frame and smaller in size than the average man — the largest of them described as almost man high, and the smallest comparable to a hobbit. 

## Melkoric Orcs
# Utumno Orcs — the first orcs to appear

## Non-Sauronic Orcs
# Worauthai Madûr — 'Free Tribes of the North': Free Orc tribe of the North who came under Service of the Witch-King
# Uruk-Ongmair — 'Orcs of Angmar': primary Orc tribe of Angmar
# Ghrazîm — 'Rack-Horde': post-Angmar survivor Orc tribe of Gundabad (alt:Grothmal-hai)
# Uruk-hai — 'Orc Tribe': the Orcs of Isengard under Saruman

## Sauronic Orcs
# Murdur-hai — 'Mordor Tribe': Second-Age Orcs of Mordor, unified under Sauron's command
# Kû-hai — 'Outlaw Tribe' of Murdur-hai gone wild (alt: Arataus-hai)
# Gazog-hai — 'Feral Tribe' of Murdur-hai gone wild
# Lugbúrz-hai — 'Black Tower Tribe' of the Orcs of Barad-dûr
# Ungur-hai — 'Terror Tribe' pf the Orcs of the Morgul Vale
# Gûshmurash-hai — 'Warmonger Tribe' of the Orcs of Western Gorgoroth (alt: Kutum-hai, Gûshmurash, Gusmuras)
# Ghâsh-hai — 'Fire Tribe' of the Orcs of the Morannon
# Rû-hai — 'Mystic Tribe' of the Orcs of Eastern Gorgoroth
# Burgûl-hai — 'Dark Tribe' of the Assassin Orcs of northern Nurn
# Gurgur-hai — 'Slaughter Tribe' of the Orcs of north-eastern Nurn
# Maraud-hai — 'Marauder Tribe' of the Orcs of southern Nurn (alt: Nau-hai) Matt note: actually the Nau-hai, but they prefer the Westron word Marauder. Their Mercenary Company the Maraud-hai is a corruption of their name.
# Rukhâs-hai — 'Orc Tribe': Murdur-hai gone wild, gone south to the Yellow Mountains
# Kazgûmhoth — 'Horde of the Silent Shadow': Orcs of Dol Guldur, gathered first under the Necromancer
