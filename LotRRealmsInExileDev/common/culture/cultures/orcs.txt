### A RUINED FORM OF LIFE ###
#The origin of orcs is uncertain, a common belief being that they
# were created by Melkor from the corruption of Elves. Whatever the true
# origin, it is certain that they would never have existed without the
# influence of Melkor. After the banishment of Melkor by the Valar, his lieutenant
#Sauron continued the legacy of breeding and manipulating orcs for his own
#purposes. Whenever dominated by a powerful will, orcs became tools of evil,
#unable to resist due to their inherent corruption.

#However, orcs have their own unique cultures, and those that find themselves without
#the influence of a Dark Lord are capable of  organizing under their
#own leadership. They are not unskilled smiths, miners, and builders, though they have little
#care for the aesthetics of their works.

# Due to a long history of targeted breeding, geographic expansion of populations,
#and periods of isolation they are diverse in form. But generally they are crooked in frame and smaller
#in size than the average man--the largest of them described as almost
#man high, and the smallest comparable to a hobbit.
