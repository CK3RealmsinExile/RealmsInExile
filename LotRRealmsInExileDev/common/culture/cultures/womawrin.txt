# She then integrated the Kûiwak, Rûlurk, Aegaw and Sûrk tribes under her leadership, creating Wômawas Drûs. The Sûrk tribe is particularly noteworthy, as the principle

# Raising a great fleet (joined by many of the Sûrk, Wôm, and Narig), he made landfall in the lands which he would name Lôkhas, making battle upon the local peoples.
