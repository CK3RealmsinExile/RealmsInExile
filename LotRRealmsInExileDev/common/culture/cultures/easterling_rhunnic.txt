# Ioriags
#Kykûria - From the heart of the Rhunnic step. Historical forefathers to the Balcoth Empire and Asdriags. Compareable to the Eothed/Rohirrim relation
#Asdriags - Primary driving force of the Balcoth Empire. Together with the Odhriags are also known as the Khundolar based on one of their ancient leaders.
#Odhriags - The Easterlings which have long settled the northern side of the Mountains of Shadow.
#Magriags - Westernmost of the Ioriags, their settlement forms the periphary of the Golden Realm. Also known as the Jangovar, they were formed from the absorbtion of the remaining Northmen of the region by Asdriag settlers

# Igath Group
#Igath - the Wainriders and the oldest inhabitants of Rhun
#Logath - one of the oldest and most well-defined groups in the Rhun, having in ages past been the main trading partners of Dorwinion in particular and the wider northman in general, a fact that has positioned their dialect of Ulghatig, Logathig as the lingua franca of Rhun, though by the rise of the Golden Realm, its prominence has long since diminished. One of the more interesting aspects of the Logath comes in the form of its’ religion, being the sole group that still retains the Matriarchical society, that was once the norm in Rhun in ages past, but that has been influenced by the Dorwinion worship of Entwifes (Turns out being trade partners and a Matriarchical society lends itself to the worship of female deities).
#Ulgath - Those of the Igath who settled the eastern shore of the Sea of Rhun
