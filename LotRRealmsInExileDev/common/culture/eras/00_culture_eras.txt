# LotR note: these are merely important years of T3A and T4A. War of the Ring is arbitrarily set in Early Medieval.

# Vector 5/25/2021 note: I've reblanced these to more align with the reality of how long our games tend to run - it was rather rarely that games ran all the way to the death of Aragorn. I hope this setup will also work adequately for future start-dates
