# EFFECT LIST 									#
#################################################
#
# Inspiration Generation Effects
#	grant_inspiration_to_character_effect 			- Creates a new Inspiration and gives it to the scope character. Type of inspiration is weighted based on character skills and personality.
#	grant_new_inspiration_in_character_realm_effect - Selects a random Pool character from the scope character's realm, then runs the above effect on them. Afterwards, move to visit the scope character's court.
#	grant_new_inspiration_in_region_effect			- Selects a random Royal Court in a given $GEOLOGICAL_REGION$. The Court's owner then has the above effect run on them.
# 	grant_new_inspiration_in_world_effect			- Selects a random geological region in the world. The selected region then has the above effect run on it.
#
# Inspired Character Movement Effects
#   inspired_character_travel_to_court_effect			- Moves $INSPIRED_CHARACTER$ to the court of $NEW_HOST$.
#	inspired_character_seek_out_new_royal_court_effect 	- Forces the scope character to look for a new, different Royal Court to visit as a guest. If one is found, uses the above effect to move there.
