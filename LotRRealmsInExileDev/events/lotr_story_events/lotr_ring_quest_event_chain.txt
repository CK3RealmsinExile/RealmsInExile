### Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,
### Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,
### Nine for Mortal Men, doomed to die,
### One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne
### In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.
### One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,
### One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.
### In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.
