# Diplomacy - Madness of the Wave - Crew gets visions of Numenor being consumed, lose their nerves, potentially go bad - chance to comfort/rally them to go onward, or have to turn back because your crew broke and mutiny
# Mariner - Fury of the Deep - Osse raises a terrible storm, try to fight it or go back (WILL damage your ship regardless of outcome)
