What are these files:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This ZIP archive contains Windows compatible Truetype (and ATM) fonts for the 
Cirth alphabet of Middle-earth.  They can be used to write Elf, Dwarf and Human 
language inscriptions with Windows applications. (The Cirth alphabet was devised 
by J.R.R. Tolkien and sometimes used by natives of Middle-earth).

These fonts are Postcard-ware.  If you like these fonts, please send me a 
postcard or letter (using an attractive or interesting stamp). If you supply me 
with your email address, I'll try to write back. You can get my current postal 
address by visiting my WWW home page (listed above).  If you do write, please 
tell me of your Cirth writing interests.  

These fonts cannot be sold for a profit.  (Although, if you really enjoy using 
these fonts and need to find some financial way of showing your appreciation, 
any and all donations will be gladly accepted.)  CD-ROM and Shareware 
distributors are requested to notify me before distributing these fonts.

These fonts may be used in any personal, private or non-commercial publication.  
Please contact me if these fonts do appear in a publication.  I'd like to receive 
a copy of it, and I may be able to provide further assistance by creating custom 
fonts or clip art for you. My current postal address is listed on my WWW home 
page (listed above).  

These fonts may NOT be used in any commercial product or publication without my 
permission and the direct consent of the Tolkien Estate.  You can contact the 
Tolkien Estate by writing to:

How do I get these files to work:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Un-Zip the "cirthe11.zip" file into a Temporary directory. 
   (Visit: www.winzip.com to download an un-zipping program, if necessary.)
2) Install the fonts on your PC using your Windows (or ATM) Control Panel.
3) The "Cirth Erebor" fonts are now ready to be used with any Windows 
   application.

Note: My Cirth fonts are very difficult to use if you do not have the latest 
version of my Cirth Help file for Windows and Microsoft Word Macro plug-ins. 
The Help file will explain the font's keymapping, language modes, and rules 
for usage. The Microsoft Word Macro plug-ins greatly simplify using the fonts.  
They can both be downloaded from:

While you're there, you may also want to download the latest versions of my 
Tengwar font packs for Windows.
