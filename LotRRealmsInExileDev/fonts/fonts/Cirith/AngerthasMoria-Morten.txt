Angerthas Moria truetype font v0.9beta
---------------------------

This truetype-font was created in 1996-97 by Morten Bek.
The reason I called it a beta is to give you all a chance to send me any 
complaints, corrections, suggestions or questions before the final is released.

E-mail me at: bek@post3.tele.dk

To install in a windows environment, copy the file cirth.ttf to 
\windows\system or \windows\fonts, depending on the Windows version you're
running. Choose Install New Font under the Font options in your Control Panel
(or confront your windows-manual if this is totally incromprehendible).

About the supported characters:
The english alphabet is fully supported with the addition of £, Å, ¢, î, †, Ç
plus th, dh and sh (which I put where I found it most fitting: under thorn,
eth and ccedilla respectively). You can find them with the Character Map, if
you're lost.
The dwarven & (ampersand) is also supported.
Finally I started making a bunch of chracters including all the numbers and ,.;
:-_!"#$%/()=?+`^~*<>\@'
Many of these aren't (of course) very Tolkienish, and most of them won't be 
useful for you at all..

I can easily convert the font to adobe type-1, bitmap or the like if anyone
should be interested.

Please keep this file with the font, whenever you copy it and spread it to
your friends.

Still fontographing..
