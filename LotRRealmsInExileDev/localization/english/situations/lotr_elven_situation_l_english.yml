 situation_type_elven_hope_sitation: "The Long Defeat"
 situation_type_elven_hope_sitation_desc: ""#TOLKIENQUOTE: “I have seen three ages in the West of the world, and many defeats, and many fruitless victories.” #!\n\nThe [elves|E] have long dwelt in [middleearth|E]. From their awakening at [cuivienen|E] to the present day, they have born witness to countless triumphs, and innumerable failures. Ever more do they grapple with the course of the world, for the [elderdays|E] are passing, and their strength wanes. Many of their number have begun to consider departing to the undying lands of [valinor|E] beyond the sea.\n\nYet not all hold that the Dominion of [men|E] is inevitable; many still love Middle-earth fiercely, in all its beauty and terrors. When this [age|E] finally passes, what shall come of the Elves? Shall they accept the Doom long-foreseen, or defy it, seeking still to make a home in Middle-earth, fair and free?\n\n#high [hope|E] is the central ressource governing the changing of [situation_phase]s in The Long Defeat. It can be gained or lost depending on the outcome of events, decisions, and wars."
