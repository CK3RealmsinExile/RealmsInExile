 ## Own Combat Move Feedback
 single_combat.0001.desc.my_feedback.stoic_veteran: "The Mundburgian Éored doesn't encourage laxity. It takes a vigilant eye and a firm arm to excel as one of the White City's protectors, and with every blow, I show [my_foe.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] how the Riders fight."

 ## Opponent Combat Move Feedback
 single_combat.0001.desc.opponent_response.stoic_veteran: "[my_foe.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] time in the Mundburgian Éored has left [my_foe.GetHerHim] stoic, brutal, and deadly with [my_foe.Custom('SignatureWeaponArticle')] [my_foe.Custom('signature_weapon')], delivering [my_foe.Custom('SignatureWeaponAttemptedHeavy')] after [my_foe.Custom('SignatureWeaponAttemptedHeavy')] to my torso."

 single_combat.0031.desc.sc_attacker.stoic_veteran: "In the Éored, we chiefly protected the Citadel against assassins, but most assassins flee at the sign of a heavily-armed Mundburgian.

 ## Defender Won, Opponent Finishing Move Feedback
 single_combat.0041.desc.opponent_response.stoic_veteran: "[sc_loser.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] uses [sc_loser.GetHerHis] [sc_loser.Custom('signature_weapon')] with all the competence typical of a Mundburgian, hewing at me with long, even strikes of [sc_loser.GetHerHis] weapon. It's difficult, but nothing I'm not able to parry well enough.\n\n"

 ## Defender Won, Opponent Finishing Move Injury

 ## Defender Lost, Opponent Finishing Move Fatality
 single_combat.0041.desc.opponent_response.stoic_veteran.fatality: "We fall into a tense pattern of strike-parry-riposte, with me slowly gaining the upper hand, wearing [sc_loser.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] down blow by blow, till [sc_loser.GetSheHe]'s accrued enough welts and wounds to kill most [sc_loser.GetWomenMen] twice over.\n\nEven [sc_loser.GetSheHe] has [sc_loser.GetHerHis] limits, though. And as the Mundburgian collapses to [sc_loser.GetHerHis] knees, ready for the deathblow, it becomes clear that we both know it."
