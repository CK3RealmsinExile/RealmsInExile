 game_rule.1141.choice.margaret: "By some confused miracle, the Witengamot has agreed on #EMP me#! as a compromise candidate, jilting the expected heir [jiltee.GetFirstName] [jiltee.GetHouse.GetName]. The great earls clearly believe they can control me, thinking me some puppet for their ambitions.\n\nI am nothing of the sort, but I welcome this unexpected shunting into power — I am, after all, my father's firstborn."
 game_rule.1141.choice.edgar: "In a fit of competence not seen in English politics in many, many years, the Witengamot has seen fit to recognize that #EMP I#! am [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( '114' ).GetTitledFirstNameNicknamedPossessive] legitimate heir and appointed me to rule the realm, jilting the expected heir [jiltee.GetFirstName] [jiltee.GetHouse.GetName].\n\nI cannot say what I have done to earn [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.FateGodNamePossessive] favor so, but I am supremely glad to have done so."

I had no ambition for this. I did not want it. I distanced myself from power as best I could, but it is clear that there is no escaping [elect.GetFaith.HighGodNamePossessive] will that I return to the lands I had happily left forever."
