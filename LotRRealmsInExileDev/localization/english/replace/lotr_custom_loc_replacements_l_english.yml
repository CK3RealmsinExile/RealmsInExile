 #LotR flavor descriptions (not technically a loc replacement, but keeping it here for readability)
 lotr_board_game_desc_pachisi: "$game_concept_board_game_type_pachisi$ is a board game originating in the Bay of Ormal. By the late [thirdage|E], its popularity has led to widespread adoption in southeastern [middleearth|E]. It is played using small tokens representing various trade goods such as saffron, silver, ruby or grain. These tokens are played on a crescent-shaped board resembling the Bay of Ormal, with the goal of consolidating the most wealth for oneself."
 lotr_board_game_desc_hnefatafl: "Khôdrivar is an board game from the great steppes of the far east. It was introduced to the [seaofrhun|E] by the Wainriders, and has stuck around since. Both players command ten cavalry and three chariot pieces, and have to strategically outwit their opponent. The game is enjoyed across all strata of Rhûnnic society - Richly adorned pieces are seen as a sign of prestige among nobles, while common soldiers make use of crude wooden figures. Remarkably, most versions function without tiles, and movement is measured using threads, sticks, or avian ribs."
 lotr_board_game_desc_tabula: "Ârûsalam is a board game that originated in the southern colonies of the [numenorean_empire|E]. Players move pieces representing naval fleets between hexagonal tiles. After the [downfall|E], a streamlined version of it was adopted by the sailors of [harad|E], and it spread from the ports of the [bayoftulwang|E] across the western shores of [middleearth|E]."
 lotr_board_game_desc_go: "Uwôr is a board game that has gained a dedicated following in the Far East of [middleearth|E]. It was originally invented as a background diversion during philosophical discussion among scholars, who soon became enraptured with it. The game centers around a number of flat stone tiles, whose edges can interlock to create larger structures. Though it looks deceivingly simple, games can last several weeks. The longest match was allegedly played over the course of three generations, until both families perished during an unrelated conflict."
 lotr_board_game_desc_fidchell: "Sah is a board game popular among the [haradrim|E]. It consists of a checkered board with three vertical levels - sand, road, and sky. Players field various animal pieces with different movement patterns. The animals used and their style of movement both vary across regions, leading to occasional shouting matches between merchants. Most common are the camel, mûmak, serpent, scorpion, and eagle."
