I focus my gaze upon their movements and realize that they are pearl divers. Out of curiosity, I decide to greet them to see their latest haul.\n\nA diver notices my presence, slowly walking up to me and asking, "My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|U], what brings you to these distant shores? We're awfully busy and have to prepare our latest catch for the day."\n\nPerhaps there is a chance to alleviate some stress from these divers by making a trade offer?"

 tgp_japan_yearly_events.0012.desc: "A heavy mist appears in the distance, getting closer with every cautious step forward. I seem to have stumbled across a hot spring, but I don't appear to be its first guest for the day.\n\nA snow monkey has already entered the bath, seemingly enjoying the hot water — soaking its fur.\n\nIs it really worth the risk to enter the hot spring with a wild animal in it?"

 tgp_japan_yearly_events.0013.desc: "In the distance, I start hearing a faint chant — surrounded by a thick mist to cover whoever is within. All I can discern is a silhouette of a [mystic.GetWomanMan].\n\nAs I approach, the [mystic.GetWomanMan] simply looks in my direction, nods, recognizing my presence, and continues with whatever preparations they are doing before entering the hot spring.\n\nThe mystic gestures for me to come forward to participate in what is about to unfold."

Almost as if sending an invitation for me to come over.\n\nAfter reaching the summit, I can finally take a breather and admire the inviting hot spring before me."

Spring is upon us, and the citizens of [ROOT.Char.GetCurrentLocation.GetName] are in high spirits and are hoping for a fair harvest to come.\n\nI overhear one of my courtiers, [hanami_enjoyer.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip], talking about the celebrations. "We shouldn't take things for granted, and this short lived season is a good reminder of that."\n\nTheir words sparks a thought in my mind — should I try my luck to see if the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.FateGodName] of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetName] smiles upon me, or simply to exists in the moment?"
