 fund_inspiration.2070.desc.hashishiyah: "I am told of the great quantities of [inspiration_owner.Custom('GetPipeWeedName')] which [inspiration_owner.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] spends [inspiration_owner.GetHerHis] funding on, before locking [inspiration_owner.GetHerselfHimself] away in the dark."

 #India -> Harad Jungles
 fund_inspiration.6002.t: "My jaunt through the jungles marches on!"
 fund_inspiration.6002.desc: "I am near-blinded by all the gems the courts I visit have to show me. I find myself yearning for the filth of the open road.\n\nI have sent a courier with a particularly tasteless gift I was given — a Mûmak's head ornament on a ring, with jewels for eyes. Have you ever seen something so garish?"
 
 #Africa -> Harad Deserts
 fund_inspiration.6003.desc: "My liege, my journey to the deserts of Haradwaith is underway, and I have joined a camel train traversing the width of the land.\n\nI send to you a piece of jewelry one of my fellow travelers granted me — a most delicate necklace covered in ostrich shell beads. I suppose you haven't seen an ostrich."

 fund_inspiration.6004.desc: "My journey through Gondor has mostly involved passing along countless ruins on the roads.\n\nOft, in search of something of interest, I chance upon little trinkets. I have sent a courier bearing the tat your way. Perhaps it shall provide some amusement."

I'm certain my travels will bring further wonders in due time."

 fund_inspiration.6503.desc: "\n\n'I have delved into a Kurgan, an ancient burial mound from the age of the Balchoth. Hundreds of long-perished horses, stuffed, preserved, and staked to the walls to stand upright, each with their own room. It was a stable for the damned, lost to time.\n\n'Knowing of my duty to seek knowledge for our realm, I considered stealing a relic from the tomb when my guide was not watching to bring to you."
