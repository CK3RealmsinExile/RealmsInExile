How mightily our [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetHeroineHero')] did, to be able to drink such a creature under the table! Perhaps a demonstration would let me truly appreciate such a feat?"\n\nI don't know where this tall tale came from, but a certain amount of pride begins to prickle..."

They appear in the distance, or peeking around little features of the terrain, fleeing when we we notice them.\n\nHours pass, the skittish locals eyeing us from afar all the while.\n\nJust they seem to have finally backed off, a cry goes up, and a frenzied horde surges at us from the cover of a ridge. Wild-eyed and emaciated,"
