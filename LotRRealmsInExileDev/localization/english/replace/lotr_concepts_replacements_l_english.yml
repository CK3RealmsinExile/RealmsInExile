 game_concept_religion_desc:0 "A $game_concept_religion$ can consist of many different denominations, called [faiths|E]. Religions, in turn, belong to one of three larger [religious_families|E]; [GetReligionFamily('rf_eruhini').GetName], [GetReligionFamily('rf_darkness').GetName] or [GetReligionFamily('rf_forcesofevil').GetName]."
 game_concept_congenital_desc:0 "Certain [traits|E] are Congenital and can be inherited by offspring. Through proper [breeding|E], it is even possible to reinforce some such Traits.\n\nFor example, if both parents are [GetTrait('intellect_good_1').GetName( GetNullCharacter )], there is a chance that their children will get the even better [GetTrait('intellect_good_2').GetName( GetNullCharacter )] Trait.\n\nBase [skills|E] are not congenital.\n\n#V Note that [bloodofnumenor|E] traits, while congenital, follow their own inheritance rules.#!" #LotR
 game_concept_religious_family_desc:0 "A $game_concept_religious_family$ is a group of [religions|E]. The $game_concept_religious_family$ affects how the various Religions, and [faiths|E] therein, view each other.\n\nThe [GetReligionFamily('rf_eruhini').GetName] are those peoples of [middleearth|E] who are opposed to the forces of the Dark Lords. They have a relatively complete understanding of the divine truth as revealed by the [valargods|E].\n\nThe [GetReligionFamily('rf_forcesofevil').GetName] are those in the service of the Dark Lords of [morgothcharacter|E] and [sauroncharacter|E], as well as those of the orcs or other fallen groups.\n\nThe [GetReligionFamily('rf_darkness').GetName] encompasses all other faiths, running a wide gambit of beliefs. However, they have access to an alignment mechanic that permits them to syncretize with one of the other two [religious_families|E]."

 game_concept_lifestyle_desc:2 "[adult|E] [rulers|E] may choose a $game_concept_lifestyle$, which will in turn allow them to select a [focus|E] and start gaining [perks|E].\n\nEach $game_concept_lifestyle$ has its own type of [experience|E], which is used to purchase $game_concept_perks$.

 game_concept_rightful_liege_desc_part2:0 "#weak Example: The Count of $c_karagmir$ is a direct vassal of the King of $k_umbar$. Since the King is neither Duke of $d_kes_karrak$, King of $k_narak$, nor Emperor of $e_umbar$, the Count of $c_karagmir$ only contributes a tiny amount of their taxes and levies.\n\nThe Count of $c_annabrith$ is also a direct vassal of the King of $k_umbar$. The King does not hold the Duchy of $d_annabrith$, so the Count also contributes reduced taxes and levies. However, because the $k_umbar$ is the De Jure Kingdom of $c_annabrith$, the Count of $c_annabrith$ still contributes significantly more tax and levies to the King than the Count of $c_karagmir$ does.#!"
