[GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'lineofhador1' ).GetName], the lord of Dor-lómin, and his younger son Gundor were slain defending the rearguard of Fingolfin. In the mountain fortresses there was a fierce battle between Morgoth's forces and the [elves|E] and [men|E] of the North.

[GetTitleByKey('d_thargelion').GetNameNoTier] was ravaged and Lake Helevorn defiled. The Orcs then crossed over Gelion into East Beleriand.

As they climbed up Gelion's banks the air filled with the sound of elven-horns and the shafts of arrows. Beren slew the Lord of Nogrod and took from him the Nauglamír. Although most of the Dwarves were killed in the ford, some escaped and fled towards the mountains. However, as they climbed the slopes of Mount Dolmed, Ents came forth and drove the Dwarves into the forest, from which none escaped.\n\nThis was Beren's last battle. As the Lord of Nogrod was dying he cursed all of the treasure taken from Doriath. Beren took the Nauglamír, washed it of blood, and took it back to Tol Galen for Lúthien.

They were slow to recover; but fortunately, their weaknesses went untested for decades. The Easterlings had also been afflicted, so that the enemies of Gondor struck mainly from the south, or were maritime raiders.
