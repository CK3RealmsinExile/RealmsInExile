Spanning the barren plains of Dagorlad, the Alliance’s ranks of Elves, Men, and Dwarves stood united under Elendil and Gil-galad against the dark armies of Orcs, Trolls, and other monstrous servants of the Dark Lord.\n\nThe battle saw waves of Sauron’s forces attempt to break the Alliance’s line, but Elendil’s and Gil-galad’s forces held firm, refusing to yield to the shadow. After a brutal exchange of blows and devastating losses on both sides, the commanders of the Alliance pressed forward, pushing Sauron’s forces back towards the gates of Barad-dûr. The Dark Lord’s captains fell, and his armies were scattered, retreating into the depths of Mordor.\n\nThough victorious, the Alliance paid a heavy price, suffering losses that would be deeply felt. Their resolve, however, remained unbroken as they advanced into Mordor itself, ready for the siege that would determine the fate of Middle-earth.#!"

Driven by a burning vengeance for their slain kin, the Dwarves of Durin's Folk assembled under the leadership of King Thráin II and his son Thorin Oakenshield to face the Orcs of Moria, led by the fearsome chieftain Azog.\n\nAs the battle raged, the Dwarves, though heavily armored and resolute, were beset by countless Orcs. Many Dwarven lords fell, and the ground was drenched in the blood of both sides. Thorin, wielding an oaken branch in place of a shield, fought valiantly, earning the title "Oakenshield" as he held the line.\n\nThe Dwarves’ determination and fury finally turned the tide, with Azog himself slain by Dáin Ironfoot, a young warrior who would one day become king. The Orcs broke and fled, but victory came at a tremendous cost, leaving the Dwarves with grievous losses. Despite their triumph, the Dwarves chose not to reclaim Moria, deeming it too cursed and dangerous to inhabit.#!"

 BattlePoIHistoricalDescGreenfields: "#emp Victor: [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'lineoftook4' ).GetFirstNameNicknamed]\nDefeated: [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'lineofgolfimbul2' ).GetFirstNameNicknamed]\nDate: T.A. 2747#!\n#weak In the northern reaches of the Shire, the Battle of the Greenfields was an unexpected clash between the peaceful Hobbits and a marauding band of Orcs led by the fierce chieftain Golfimbul. Caught off-guard by the incursion, the Hobbits rallied under the leadership of Bandobras “Bullroarer” Took, a Hobbit of unusual stature and strength.\n\nThe Hobbits, typically unskilled in warfare, defended their homeland with slings, bows, and courage, standing firm against the Orcs who vastly underestimated their resistance. In a daring charge, Bullroarer Took confronted Golfimbul directly, felling the Orc chieftain with a single swing of his club. The blow was so mighty that it sent Golfimbul’s head soaring through the air, where it landed in a rabbit hole—an act said to have invented the game of golf.\n\nWith their leader slain, the Orcs scattered and fled, leaving the Shire free from further menace. The victory became a cherished tale in Hobbit history, celebrating the courage of Bullroarer and the unexpected valor of the Shire-folk.#!"
