Spanning the barren plains of Dagorlad, the Alliance’s ranks of Elves, Men, and Dwarves stood united under Elendil and Gil-galad against the dark armies of Orcs, Trolls, and other monstrous servants of the Dark Lord.\n\nThe battle saw waves of Sauron’s forces attempt to break the Alliance’s line, but Elendil’s and Gil-galad’s forces held firm, refusing to yield to the shadow. After a brutal exchange of blows and devastating losses on both sides, the commanders of the Alliance pressed forward, pushing Sauron’s forces back towards the gates of Barad-dûr. The Dark Lord’s captains fell, and his armies were scattered, retreating into the depths of Mordor.\n\nThough victorious, the Alliance paid a heavy price, suffering losses that would be deeply felt. Their resolve, however, remained unbroken as they advanced into Mordor itself, ready for the siege that would determine the fate of Middle-earth.#!"

Driven by a burning vengeance for their slain kin, the Dwarves of Durin's Folk assembled under the leadership of King Thráin II and his son Thorin Oakenshield to face the Orcs of Moria, led by the fearsome chieftain Azog.\n\nAs the battle raged, the Dwarves, though heavily armored and resolute, were beset by countless Orcs. Many Dwarven lords fell, and the ground was drenched in the blood of both sides. Thorin, wielding an oaken branch in place of a shield, fought valiantly, earning the title "Oakenshield" as he held the line.\n\nThe Dwarves’ determination and fury finally turned the tide, with Azog himself slain by Dáin Ironfoot, a young warrior who would one day become king. The Orcs broke and fled, but victory came at a tremendous cost, leaving the Dwarves with grievous losses. Despite their triumph, the Dwarves chose not to reclaim Moria, deeming it too cursed and dangerous to inhabit.#!"

Caught off-guard by the incursion, the Hobbits rallied under the leadership of Bandobras “Bullroarer” Took, a Hobbit of unusual stature and strength.\n\nThe Hobbits, typically unskilled in warfare, defended their homeland with slings, bows, and courage, standing firm against the Orcs who vastly underestimated their resistance. In a daring charge, Bullroarer Took confronted Golfimbul directly, felling the Orc chieftain with a single swing of his club. The blow was so mighty that it sent Golfimbul’s head soaring through the air, where it landed in a rabbit hole—an act said to have invented the game of golf.\n\nWith their leader slain, the Orcs scattered and fled, leaving the Shire free from further menace. The victory became a cherished tale in Hobbit history, celebrating the courage of Bullroarer and the unexpected valor of the Shire-folk.#!"

In that time, the most important danger to Gondor was in its south, because the Haradrim had occupied South Gondor and there were many armed conflicts along the river Poros.\n\nIn T.A. 2885, emissaries of Sauron stirred up the Haradrim who crossed the Poros and invaded Ithilien with a large army. When King Folcwine of [rohan|E] heard of the invasion he fulfilled the Oath of Eorl and sent many men led by his sons Folcred and Fastred to help Gondor.\n\nTúrin II defeated the Haradrim invaders with the help of the troops from Rohan in a battle at the Crossings of Poros, but Folcred and Fastred fell side by side in battle in Ithilien.\n\nWhile Túrin achieved victory, the Rohirrim suffered the loss of their two oldest princes. Folcred and Fastred were buried together high upon the shore of the river Poros according to the customs of their people in a burial mound, which was called "Haudh in Gwanûr". The mound stood there for a long time and the enemies of Gondor were afraid to passit As a consequence of the death of his two older brothers Folcred and Fastred, Fengel, the third and youngest son of King Folcwine became heir to the throne of Rohan.#!"
