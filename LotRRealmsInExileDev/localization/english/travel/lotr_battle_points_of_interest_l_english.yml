They gathered their army and sacked Doriath, taking much plunder with them. Even though they had suffered many losses, they were untroubled upon their return journey to Nogrod.\n\nUnaware of any peril, the reduced host of Dwarves burdened with the spoils of Doriath entered the ford. As they climbed up Gelion's banks the air filled with the sound of elven-horns and the shafts of arrows. Beren slew the Lord of Nogrod and took from him the Nauglamír. Although most of the Dwarves were killed in the ford, some escaped and fled towards the mountains. However, as they climbed the slopes of Mount Dolmed, Ents came forth and drove the Dwarves into the forest, from which none escaped.\n\nThis was Beren's last battle. As the Lord of Nogrod was dying he cursed all of the treasure taken from Doriath. Beren took the Nauglamír, washed it of blood, and took it back to Tol Galen for Lúthien. The rest of the treasure though was cast into the Ascar, which from then on carried the named Rathlóriel, the Goldenbed.#!"

Spanning the barren plains of [GetTitleByKey('d_dagorlad').GetNameNoTier], the Alliance’s ranks of [elves|E], [men|E], and [dwarves|E] stood united under [elendil|E] and Gil-galad against the dark armies of [orcs|E], Trolls, and other monstrous servants of the Dark Lord.\n\nThe battle saw waves of Sauron’s forces attempt to break the Alliance’s line, but Elendil and Gil-galad’s forces held firm, refusing to yield to the shadow. After a brutal exchange of blows and devastating losses on both sides, the commanders of the Alliance pressed forward, pushing Sauron’s forces back towards the gates of [GetTitleByKey('c_barad_dur').GetNameNoTier]. The Dark Lord’s captains fell, and his armies were scattered, retreating into the depths of Mordor.\n\nThough victorious, the Alliance paid a heavy price, suffering losses that would be deeply felt.

After staying in [gondor|E] for a year, High King [isildur|E] decided to return to his own realm of [arnor|E]. His host journeyed north from [osgiliath|E] along the [anduin|E], seeking to cross the High Pass to [rivendell|E]. While passing the Gladden Fields, the singing [dunedain|E] were ambushed by a large host of [orcs|E] hiding in the forest to their east. Due to the unfavorable hilly terrain, the [dunedain|E] could not form a [Glossary( 'Dírnaith', 'DIRNAITH_GLOSS' )] against the attackers. [orcish|E] archers assailed the Dúnedain infantry, but proved ineffective against their heavy armor. After their initial charge faltered, the Orcs retreated and feigned defeat. They attacked again only a mile further north, using their superior numbers to form a wide battle line that began to encircle the Dúnedain. Though they took heavy losses, the Orcs soon overwhelmed Isildur's men, and the Dúnedain were slaughtered.\n\nOf the 200 knights, only three survived. Unbeknownst to his men, Isildur attempted to use the [oneringshort|E] to escape, but it betrayed him and slipped off his finger. He was pierced by dozens of arrows and fell into the [anduin|E]. His body was never found. With Isildurs death, the [realms_in_exile|E] fractured and the [onering|E] disappeared from history.#!"
 DIRNAITH_GLOSS: "The Dírnaith was a [numenorean|E] battle tactic. It was a wedge formation launched over a short distance, intended for rapid attack against a rallying host or defensive formation, most effective on open ground. It relied on the great strength and statue of the [numenoreans|E] to crush an enemy before they could properly array themselves for battle."

Many Dwarven lords fell, and the ground was drenched in the blood of both sides. Thorin, wielding an oaken branch in place of a shield, fought valiantly, earning the title [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'lineofdurin83' ).GetNickname] as he held the line.\n\nThe Dwarves’ determination and fury finally turned the tide, with Azog himself slain by [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'lineofdurin90' ).GetFirstNameNicknamed], a young warrior who would one day become king. The Orcs broke and fled, but victory came at a tremendous cost, leaving the Dwarves with grievous losses.

Caught off-guard by the incursion, the Hobbits rallied under the leadership of Bandobras [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'lineoftook4' ).GetNickname] Took, a Hobbit of unusual stature and strength.\n\nThe Hobbits, typically unskilled in warfare, defended their homeland with slings, bows, and courage, standing firm against the Orcs who vastly underestimated their resistance. In a daring charge, Bullroarer Took confronted Golfimbul directly, felling the Orc chieftain with a single swing of his club. The blow was so mighty that it sent Golfimbul’s head soaring through the air, where it landed in a rabbit hole—an act said to have invented the game of golf.\n\nWith their leader slain, the Orcs scattered and fled, leaving the Shire free from further menace. The victory became a cherished tale in Hobbit history, celebrating the courage of Bullroarer and the unexpected valor of the Shire-folk.#!"
