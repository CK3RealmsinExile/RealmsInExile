Then the Dark Lord sent forth his armies, led by the dragon Glaurung, including Balrogs and multitudes of Orcs, and they slaughtered anyone they came across.\n\nThe highlands of [GetTitleByKey('c_dorthonion').GetNameNoTier] bore much of the assault and were overrun. [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'linefinwe34' ).GetFirstName] and [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'linefinwe35' ).GetFirstName] were slain, and many of Bëor's folk fell. [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'linefinwe35' ).GetName] came north from [GetTitleByKey('k_nargothrond').GetNameNoTier] with an army, but was surrounded at the Fen of Serech and cut off from his people. Finrod would have been killed or captured, but was saved by [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'lineofbeor28' ).GetFirstName] and his twelve followers, who was fighting in western Dorthonion near the Pass of Sirion.\n\nIn the north-west, [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'linefinwe4' ).GetName] and [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'linefinwe20' ).GetName] marched with their host to aid the sons of Finarfin, but they were driven back to the fortresses in the mountains. [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'lineofhador1' ).GetName], the lord of Dor-lómin, and his younger son Gundor were slain defending the rearguard of Fingolfin. In the mountain fortresses there was a fierce battle between Morgoth's forces and the Elves and Men of the North. But [GetTitleByKey('k_hithlum').GetNameNoTier] was successfully defended against the Orcs and Balrogs.\n\nThe March of [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'linefinwe10' ).GetName] was assaulted heavily by the armies of Morgoth. With great loss, the orcish hosts forced the Pass of Aglon, and [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'linefinwe12' ).GetName] and [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'linefinwe14' ).GetName] fled with their people to Nargothrond. Maedhros was later able to reclose the Pass, but the horsemen of the people of Fëanor were overwhelmed on the plain of [GetTitleByKey('c_lothlann').GetNameNoTier] and [GetTitleByKey('c_dor_maglor').GetNameNoTier] was taken. Glaurung came there and burned the land between the arms of Gelion. With the gap taken, the Orcs moved south and captured [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'linefinwe13' ).GetName]'s fortress in Mount Rerir. [GetTitleByKey('d_thargelion').GetNameNoTier] was ravaged and Lake Helevorn defiled. The Orcs then crossed over Gelion into East Beleriand. Maglor fled to join Maedhros at [GetTitleByKey('c_himring').GetNameNoTier] while Caranthir fled south with [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'linefinwe15' ).GetName] and [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'linefinwe16' ).GetName] to [GetTitleByKey('c_amon_ereb').GetNameNoTier], which they defended with the help of the Green-elves, and the Orcs did not come into Taur-im-Duinath or [GetTitleByKey('k_ossiriand').GetNameNoTier].\n\nThus the Siege of Angband was broken, and the forces of Morgoth were able to roam at will throughout the north. His enemies were decimated, and most of the [sindarelves|E] fled south to [GetTitleByKey('k_doriath').GetNameNoTier], Nargothrond, Falas and Ossiriand. #!"

They gathered their army and sacked Doriath, taking much plunder with them. Even though they had suffered many losses, they were untroubled upon their return journey to Nogrod.\n\nUnaware of any peril, the reduced host of Dwarves burdened with the spoils of Doriath entered the ford. As they climbed up Gelion's banks the air filled with the sound of elven-horns and the shafts of arrows. Beren slew the Lord of Nogrod and took from him the Nauglamír. Although most of the Dwarves were killed in the ford, some escaped and fled towards the mountains. However, as they climbed the slopes of Mount Dolmed, Ents came forth and drove the Dwarves into the forest, from which none escaped.\n\nThis was Beren's last battle. As the Lord of Nogrod was dying he cursed all of the treasure taken from Doriath. Beren took the Nauglamír, washed it of blood, and took it back to Tol Galen for Lúthien. The rest of the treasure though was cast into the Ascar, which from then on carried the named Rathlóriel, the Goldenbed.#!"

By this time, the [kingsmen|E] had already grown distrustful of the [powersgods|E], but in his desparation Tar-Ancalimon nevertheless begged [manwecharactershort|E] to intervene and lead his riders to victory. The ill-fated charge swiftly faltered and found its end in the muddy ground of the battlefield. The king's mount fell and Tar-Ancalimon, though relatively unharmed, was deeply embarassed by this humiliation.\n\nDespite the failed charge, the Storm-King's center eventually broke and his army was routed in a decisive Númenórean victory. One by one, the remaining citadels of [anbalkumagan|E] would fall or surrender over the course of a few years, and the War of the Renegades ended under the restored authority of the [numenorean_empire|E].#!"

After a brutal exchange of blows and devastating losses on both sides, the commanders of the Alliance pressed forward, pushing Sauron’s forces back towards the gates of [GetTitleByKey('c_barad_dur').GetNameNoTier].

[orcish|E] archers assailed the Dúnedain infantry, but proved ineffective against their heavy armor. After their initial charge faltered, the Orcs retreated and feigned defeat.

Though they took heavy losses, the Orcs soon overwhelmed Isildur's men, and the Dúnedain were slaughtered.\n\nOf the 200 knights, only three survived. Unbeknownst to his men, Isildur attempted to use the [oneringshort|E] to escape, but it betrayed him and slipped off his finger. He was pierced by dozens of arrows and fell into the [anduin|E].
