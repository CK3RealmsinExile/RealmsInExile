 nenya_description:0 "The Ring of Adamant and Ring of Water, [nenya|E] was wrought of [mithril|E] and set with a stone of adamant. Normally hidden, when revealed it burns bright, as a star upon the finger. In it is the power of preservation, protection, and concealment from evil. \n\nIt was given to Galadriel, and enabled her to increase her own power and to preserve [lothlorien|E] unstained by the ravages of time. There, an image of [aman|E] was preserved in [middleearth|E], and it was one of the strongest realms of the [elves|E]."

After their fall, the [silmarils|E] were the only remaining remnant of the undwindled primordial light.\n\nBeautiful beyond measure, of worth beyond comprehension, all admired and desired them. Much of the great tales and tragedies of the [firstage|E] can be traced back to their creation and their later theft by [morgothcharacter|E], being the impetus of the [oathoffeanor|E]. In the end, the three were sundered, one finding its place in the sky, one in the heart of the earth, and the last in the keeping of the waters. \n\nIt is said that in the Last Days [feanor|E] shall gather them once more, break them, and by their light restore the [twotrees|E]."

 rop_name:0 "The Amazing Tale of the Rings of Power"
 rop_description:0 "Finely embossed, this book contains a great series of tales concerning the [secondage|E] of [middleearth|E], particularly the forging of the [ringsofpower|E], the [elves|E], and the [numenorean|E]. Painstakingly illumined and with brilliant illustrations, it is a work of great expense without doubt.\n\nTitled 'The Amazing Tale of the Rings of Power' and alternatively known as the [Glossary('Nyárië i Túrecormaron','nyarie_i_turecormaron_gloss')], it is unlike any other work concerning the era. Much of its writings contradict the known facts of the era, and has a strange obsession with an alternate variant of the Lady Galadriel. The timeline is distorted and compressed, making it all but useless in cross referencing historical events. It has many strange digressions, such as devoting larges sections to the society of nomadic and surprisingly inhumane [halflings|E]. \n\nIt does claim to know the origins of both [mithril|El] and the means of making [ringsofpower|E], though these have been decried by what [dwarves|E] and [elves|E] alike have heard of it. It argues to possess an insight into the politics of late imperial [numenor|E], yet claims no Numenorean Empire existed before the rise of Ar-Pharazon.\n\nIn particular the piece seems to paint most Elves as highly incompetent, ranging from High-king Erenion Gil-galad's policies, Lady Galadriel's rage and arrogance, or Lord [celebrimbor|E] as a novice craftsman who needs to be taught what an alloy is. [elrondshort|E] Half-elven is portrayed as a minor lord unfit for counsel and an oathbreaker.\n\nIt is infamously known by most scholars of repute as the Book of Lies, for it contains little else. Its authors have been lost to history, but some speculate that it was the work of [sauroncharacter|E] himself - or at least those in his employ. For who else could stand to benefit from such an abject distortion of the truth of history? "

 cursed_sword_of_blacklocks_description:0 "Forged by Fulla VII 'Flamehand', Dumsuhersar was forged of star-metal, with an appearance ashen yet containing a hidden fire. It was meant to be a signal of a new age for the [dwarves|E] of Bizarûldûm, and a heirloom for the House of Thrár. Of such importance was his masterwork to him, Fulla VII wore the [Concept('greaterrings', 'rings')|E] of two Dwarven clans while forging it - his own, and that of his [stonefoot|E] kin on loan. It took him weeks of work, with little sleep and much agony. Yet in the end he wrought perhaps the greatest sword to ever be forged by the Dwarves of the East.\n\nBut it became an omen of doom, for but days after its completion, not one but three [dragons|E] descended upon Bizarûldûm. They sought the riches of the greatest mansion of the East, the hordes of two clans. The surprise of the Dwarves was total, for until that time, no dragon had dared come so far south as the Rôisûri. Fulla VII valiantly faced down one of the dragons himself, with his royal guard surrounding him. With rings still on finger and Dumsuhersar in hand, he wounded it deeply, but was incinerated along with the two rings. Dumsuhersar alone survived the dragon fire. His son Thrár IV rallied the [blacklocks|E] and Stonefoots, avenging his father and slaying the dragons. Yet he perished in the battles, and thus the royal line of Thrár was wiped out in Bizarûldûm. The Stonefoots retrieved Dumsuhersar in the aftermath, but considered the blade accursed. It's creation had seemingly brought nigh utter ruin upon what was once the greatest of the mansions of the East. Due to their newfound [Concept('successionofbizaruldum','feud')|E] with the Blacklock cadet branch of Nargubraz, the Stonefoots of Bizarûldûm opted to send the blade to Thrár's southern line in the Yellow Mountains. There it became the heirloom of their line, and would remain in their keeping.\n\nA folk legend later developed among the Dwarves of Bizarûldûm, saying, "the Old Line shall rule again when the North-Hammer reforges the blade of woe, cleansing it by gold."

After emptying his quiver he finally pierced his heart with the lucky Dwarven Black Arrow, saved by his ancestors from the ruin of Dale.\n\nIt now sports a rich painted decoration of flaming dragons, painted in red and gold along its haft."

 throne_ovatha_description:0 "This magnificent throne, made from exotic rosewood, carved and inlaid with ivory, Kine horn and gold to represent hunting and war scenes, was commissioned by the last ruling Ôvatha of Khand: Ôvatha IX.\n\nThough his descendants could not maintain his hold over the restive tribes, the throne remains a prestigious heirloom, and a reminder to everyone of the owner's claim to rule over all Variag."
 
 crown_bountig_name:0 "Crown of Bountig"
 crown_bountig_description:0 "Wrought of iron and gold, the crown of Bountig is relatively unadorned and simple, with only small embellishments. Some say that the iron in it was forged from the melted down spear of Ôvatha VIII of Khand, though these rumors have never been substantiated. It stands as a symbol of the ruler of Medloshukain, and their rightful lordship of their brethren."

 ## Thâni-Hazâd ##

 witness_of_restraint_name:0 "Witness of Restraint"
 witness_of_restraint_description:0 "A small, beautiful golden mace, Witness of Restraint is the ancestral weapon long passed down by the Adunai Lords of Uruloni, only rarely used. In many ways it is more a symbol of their office than a true weapon, resembling a sceptre at first glance.\n\nIt's name is supposedly meant to be a reminder to the Lords - though they rule, and possess the recourse of force to maintain it, restraint should ever be their first instinct. If it is wielded too oft and without care, their authority, like the gold of the mace, may be worn away, leaving only a core of iron which will rust away."

 narunuphkaran_name:0 "Narûnûphkaran"
 narunuphkaran_description:0 "Narûnûphkaran, or 'Cleaver of Foolish Folks', is a mighty axe, the preferred weapon of the lords of Hôlzôrêth. Double-headed and with a mighty oaken shaft, it was purportedly crafted by Blacklock [dwarves|E] on commission during the first An-Balkumagan and Balan-lai conflicts.\n\nIt is a weighty weapon, crafted for men of [numenorean|E] stature, and requires two hands to wield, leaving the wielder more vulnerable. But as a result, a blow from it is almost always fatal, with few armours able to absorb such mighty strikes."
 
 the_grand_concordant_name:0 "The Grand Concordant"
 the_grand_concordant_description:0 "Peace treaty, defensive pact, constitution - the Grand Concordant is all these things. Written after long negotiation between the seven youngest children of Imrazor following their triumph in the civil wars following his death, the Grand Concordant established the Balan-lai, determined how the lands of the former Princedom would be divided, as well as the customs and rules by which the Princes would rule and hold each other accountable. Eight beautifully illuminated copies of the document were created - one for each of the seven children, and one to be sent back to Numenor for safe-keeping, record, and the Sceptre's approval (which was granted).\n\nWritten on vellum and bound with fine leather, the front cover bore written in golden Tengwar, "The Grand Concordant of the Children of Imrazor", with a subscript reading "containing the agreements, boundaries, and laws by which their inheritances shall be bound". Each copy was signed by the seven new princes and princesses to show their endorsement. At the back of each copy was left blank pages, wherein future amendments (such as the later Prohibition of Unification) could be recorded."

 crown_of_imrazor_II_name:0 "Imperial Crown of Imrazor II"
 crown_of_imrazor_II_description:0 "Imrazor II, King of Gimilthani, is a polarizing figure in the history of the Balan-lai. Once, he was a great hero, valiantly leading the Princes against the ambitions of An-Balkumagan and repulsing them. Yet in his later years, he grew paranoid and ambitious in equal measure, deeply frustrated by the divisions among the Kharadunai and the stagnation of the Balan-lai. In time this led to a mighty war between the princes, Imrazor seeking to force the Balan-lai to kneel to his power, though Imrazor would ultimately lose it.\n\nTo symbolize his self-proclaimed mastery of the region, Imrazor commissioned a great crown at the start of the war. Fashioned in the style of the old colonial princes, it was meant to mark the impending rebirth of the unified Princedom of Zimrathani. Wrought of gold and silver, it had a star of mithril set on its brow - an indescribably rare metal in the southlands of Middle-earth, rumored to have come from Numenor of old. The crown would be lost with Imrazor's death, likely secreted away by an enterprising soldier. It was actually a point of distrust and intrigue for centuries after, as peddlers and princes alike would claim to either have, or know of, the crown's true location.\n\nIf it were to be found again, it would be a potent symbol indeed."

 fated_heir_name:0 "Martaryon"
 fated_heir_description:0 "[feanor|E] made for each of his sons a blade, but none greater than that of [maedhros|E]. For his heir, Feanor crafted a magnificent sword, larger than any other he made. While most of his sons' blades were simple, elegant, but finely crafted, the blade of Maedhros was different. Richly ornamented, it was no less deadly than its kin, but the very vision of it proclaimed to all its nature. A mighty jewel shaped in the winged star of [nolofinwe|E] was set in the cross guard, and it seemed to gleam with light as if a living flame was within it. In the pommel was set the Star of Feanor. For Feanor intended this blade to be a statement - that Finwe had but one true and rightful heir - Feanor. And so in turn did Feanor have but#bold one#! firstborn son, his own heir - Maedhros. By his design, Feanor meant to proclaim the continuity of the rightful authority of the Kingship of the Noldor, passed from father to son, regardless of whatever minor disagreements may arise. This was made clear in the blade's name: [Glossary('Martaryon','martaryon_gloss')]. It was a statement of trust and a proclamation of the wielder's lofty heritage - and that they were worthy of the power it granted.\n\nIt is perhaps fitting then, that the blade would disappear with Maedhros's own kingship. For when he was seized by [morgothcharacter|E] and set to torment on Thangorodrim, the blade too was taken, and cast into the vaults of [angband|E], whence it was not seen again."

These bolts were extraordinarily heavy and tough, capable of breaking stone or plate armor. No mannish lance could compare to the raw penetrating power of it. It required such power, for these were weapons designed with one purpose - to pierce scale and slay [dragons|E].\n\nLong did the dwarves feud with the [drakes|E], and nowhere more fiercely than in the far north, and the Grey Mountains. Though not all Dragons fly, many did, and the Dwarves, short but ingenious, soon devised a means of striking their foes from the skies - the Windlance. On account of the power they had to hurl their bolts with, Windlances were large and unwieldy, but functioned well as static defenses.\n\nThis is a lance from one such weapon - it has evidently seen use, and remains heavy enough a man might use it as a sort of club if pressed. Wrought of black iron, some have also named such bolts the ‘black arrows’ of the Dwarves."

As a young man, before he became king, he founded the Guild of Venturers, which would go on to have a glorious future during the Númenórean colonisation of Middle-Earth. Erendis grew bitter towards Aldarion, and she withdrew to the sheep-lands of the countryside with their daughter Ancalimë, who remained their only child. Over time, Ancalimë, nicknamed the Princess Sheperdess, would inherit her mother's disdain for men. She would go on to become the first ruling Queen of Númenor, Tar-Ancalimë.

It is said to be a trophy from the hunt of a massive bear lurking in the region of a large rock formation known to the locals as "The Carrock".\n\nThe hair around its head is uncommonly long and silky, and it bears silver and gold plaits, in the fashion of the chieftains of the region. Your antiquarian assumes this is a local custom : to plait the hair of remarkable bears, in exchange for their protection.\n\nThis theory certainly makes sense, but you can't help but wonder at how #italic human #!this hair looks..."

 goblin_crown_name:0 "The Hammered Helm"
 goblin_crown_description:0 "After the Sacking of Imladris, a crude helm was created to celebrate the triumph. While the Goblins hold that they melted down the swords of their hated foes to make it, it is more likely that they used whatever scraps of metal they could find. Regardless, the Helm remains a grim reminder of their overpowering force."
 
 fram_spear_name:0 "Spear of Fram"
 fram_spear_description:0 "This short, broad headed spear is clearly of Dwarven make and design. It bears runes of prowess and of piercing, along with the name "Fram, son of Frumgar".

Whether this inscription was added by Faderda himself, or by a later owner to give weight to their claim, remains unknown."

 narmacil_standard_description:0 "When king Narmacil II of [gondor|E] marched against the Wairider army, his standard bearer flew high the royal standard, of black velvet embroidered with [mithril|E] thread, catching the light of the sun and bringing hope to the [gondorian|E] soldiers.\n\nIt was therefore a profound humiliation to the grieving kingdom when, after the death of the king on the field of battle, the wainrider army displayed this glorious trophy on their war chief's tent.\n\nAfter Calimehtar defeated the Wainriders, the standard could not be found and disappeared from history."

The patterns of the White Tree and winged crown in [gondorian|E] late royal style are easily recognisable.\n\nAfter the [gondorian|E] defeat at the battle of the Morannon, the Wainriders looted the king's campaign train and took this beautifully crafted piece of furniture for their own. It was modified to integrate a backrest and serve as a diwan for the Wainrider general's war council.\n\nWhen the Wainrider army was finally defeated the campaign bed was salvaged by a fleeing soldier and has seen various masters since."

 turann_description:0 "In 1500 of the [secondage|E], Sauron befriended [celebrimbor|E] in the guise of [annatarcharacter|E], claiming to be sent by the Valar as an emissary. He presented the Elven lord with the design for an intricate mithril hammer, a tool with which ever greater marvels could be crafted. Celebrimbor, no stranger to fine works and beautiful creations, was amazed at the beauty and elegance of the idea, evidence of [annatarcharacter|E]'s incredible insights. Together they crafted the hammer, bonding in shared toil, or so the Elf thought.\n\nIt was with this hammer in hand that the heir of [feanor|E] would lead the Gwaith-i-Mirdain in their greatest work, which would eventually become the [ringsofpower|E].\n\nA smith could craft wonders, equipped with such a tool."

It was not his only hammer, and indeed, not the one which purportedly was used in the forging of the [silmarils|E]. However, this hammer was ideally sized for travelling and was said to have been gifted to him by his teacher Mahtan upon the ending of his apprenticeship. As a result, this hammer was the one most often found on [feanor|E]'s person during his travels around [valinor|E], and was brought with him into exile.\n\nIt is one of the few personal objects of [feanor|E]'s to survive the [firstage|E] in the Hither Lands, eventually making its way into the possession of Celebrimbor before being lost during the [waroftheelvesandsauron|E].\n\nA smith could craft wonders, equipped with such a tool."

The crest and reliefs on the surface of the helmet are finely adorned with intricate Dwarven motifs that recount the deeds and bravery of Azaghâl in the struggle against the forces of [morgothcharacter|E].

 sceptre_of_umbar_description:0 "An ivory sceptre inlaid with fine worked gold and jewels.\n\nThe office of the Governor of [umbar|E] was one appointed directly by the [numenorean|E] Crown. Often these were powerful nobles or military officers. As the symbol of their office, they received a scepter of ivory, carved and inlaid with gold and jewels. In the carvings were oaths of fealty and loyalty to the Numenorean throne, as well as a curse if its holder should ever betray the faith of the rightful King.\n\nAfter the [downfallofnumenor|E], it became the badge of office for the Lord of Umbar, the elected leader of the [black_numenoreans|E] in the Council of Umbar. The Scepter was lost during Eärnil I’s conquest of Umbar.

Heavy and ill fitting, the crown in many ways is symbolic of Herumor’s reign. Its craftsmanship is middling by Numenorean standards, being a rush job. The crown was lost with the swift fall of his kingdom."

 crown_of_fuinur_description:0 "A composite crown of silver, gold, and bronze, the Crown of Fuinur was the symbol of the [black_numenorean|E] king of the same name.\n\nThe crown was created by Fuinur melting down the crowns of the petty-kings of later Pezarsan, a symbol of their submission to his new kingdom. The new crown was unique, but the elements did not blend well, and was considered by some to be ugly. It was lost with his kingdom."

 gilded_armour_of_imrazor_name:0 "Gilded Armour of Imrazôr"
 gilded_armour_of_imrazor_description:0 "More a show-piece than practical protection, this armour was bequeathed to prince Imrazôr by his father Ar-Sakalthôr when he left [numenor|E] to take up his princely title. Wrought of gleaming silver and inlaid with [mithril|E] and gold, it is a stunning example of Numenorean artistry, incorporating many of its common motifs, such as ships, waves, and stars. Of particular note is a great jewel inset in the center of the chest, carved into the shape of the Star of Earendil.\n\nThe armour was inherited and then borne by Imrazôr's eldest legitimate son Adûnaphazôr following his death.
