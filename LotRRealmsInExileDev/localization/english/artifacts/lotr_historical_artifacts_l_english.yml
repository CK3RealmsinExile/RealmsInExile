Wrought by [sauroncharacter|E] in the fires of Mount Doom, in it was poured his malice, his cruelty, and his desire to dominate all life. Amplifying power in accordance with the innate power of the bearer, it is treacherous for all but [sauroncharacter|E] to wield, for it is a part of him - he alone is its master. \n\nAll the [ringsofpower|E], including the [threeringsofelvesshort|E], [sevenringsofdwarvesshort|E], and [nineringsofmenshort|E], were bound to its fate, and if it were unmade, their power too shall fail. Only in Mount Doom can it be destroyed, in the heart of [sauroncharacter|E]'s realm. Such a little thing... \n\n#S One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.#!"

And though some hold that they were gifted to the Dwarves by their Elven friends, others believe it was [sauronthedarklordcharacter|E] who granted them in order to control and corrupt the children of [aulecharacter|E]."

Blazing like lightning given form, it is the incarnation of the final role of the [elderkingcharacter|E] as both judge and executor of the Law. Wielded in ancient days by [manwecharactershort|E] himself, whole armies fell beneath its fury, withering and scattered like leaves before a mighty tempest.\n\nThe blade would not be seen again until the [warofwrath|E] - when it was wielded by [manwecharactershort|E]'s herald, [eonwecharacter|E], who held it in his master's stead. It was with this blade that [morgothcharacter|E] was once more bested and bound anew with chains to be brought before the [elderkingcharacter|E] in [Glossary('Máhanaxar','mahanaxar_gloss')]. If it should be needed again before the End, it shall once more serve as the weapon of judgement to all those who would overturn the Law, and the Order of [eru|E].\n\n#TOLKIENQUOTE It came to pass that at last the gates of [utumno|E] were broken and its halls unroofed, and [melkorcharacter|E] took refuge in the uttermost pit. Thence, seeing that all was lost (for that time), he sent forth on a sudden a host of [balrogs|E], the last of his servants that remained, and they assailed the standard of Manwë, as it were a tide of flame. But they were withered in the wind of his wrath and slain with the lightning of his sword; and Melkor stood at last alone.#!"

 silmaril_name: "Silmaril"
 silmaril_description: "One of three [silmarils|E], gems of immense might and beauty. Crafted of the hard-crystalline substance [Glossary('silima','silima_gloss')] as their shell and named after it, they were the masterworks of [feanor|E]. In their heart burned some of the Light of Valinor from the [twotrees|E]. After their fall, the [silmarils|E] were the only remaining remnant of the undwindled primordial light.\n\nBeautiful beyond measure, of worth beyond comprehension, all admired and desired them. Much of the great tales and tragedies of the [firstage|E] can be traced back to their creation and their later theft by [morgothcharacter|E], being the impetus of the [oathoffeanor|E]. In the end, the three were sundered, one finding its place in the sky, one in the heart of the earth, and the last in the keeping of the waters. \n\nIt is said that in the Last Days [feanor|E] shall gather them once more, break them, and by their light restore the [twotrees|E]."

 hyandolire_name: "Hyandolírë"
 hyandolire_description: "In the disquiet of [valinor|E], [feanor|E] forged each of his [sonsoffeanorshort|E] a blade to bear if the worst should come. Though relatively unadorned, few blades since compared to these masterworks of metallurgy. Each blade was subtly different to correspond with each son's strengths and weaknesses. \n\nThe blade of [maglor|E] was [Glossary('Hyandolírë','hyandolire_gloss')]. The name was a reference to his great voice and its power, and it seemed to sing as it cut through the air.

Though he wounded him grievously seven times, the [noldo|E] king finally fell under Grond, the Hammer of the Underworld.\n\nIt was brought to Gondolin along with Fingolfin's remains by Thorondor, king of the Eagles.

 rop_name: "The Amazing Tale of the Rings of Power"
 rop_description: "Finely embossed, this book contains a great series of tales concerning the [secondage|E] of [middleearth|E], particularly the forging of the [ringsofpower|E], the [elves|E], and the [numenorean|E]. Painstakingly illumined and with brilliant illustrations, it is a work of great expense without doubt.\n\nTitled 'The Amazing Tale of the Rings of Power' and alternatively known as the [Glossary('Nyárië i Túrecormaron','nyarie_i_turecormaron_gloss')], it is unlike any other work concerning the era. Much of its writing contradicts the known facts of the era and has a strange obsession with an alternate variant of the Lady Galadriel. The timeline is distorted and compressed, making it all but useless in cross-referencing historical events. It has many strange digressions, such as devoting large sections to the society of nomadic and surprisingly inhumane [halflings|E]. \n\nIt does claim to know the origins of both [mithril|El] and the means of making [ringsofpower|E], though these have been decried by what [dwarves|E] and [elves|E] alike have heard of it. It argues to possess an insight into the politics of late imperial [numenor|E], yet claims no Numenorean Empire existed before the rise of Ar-Pharazon.\n\nIn particular, the piece seems to paint most Elves as highly incompetent, ranging from High King Erenion Gil-galad's policies to Lady Galadriel's rage and arrogance or Lord [celebrimbor|E] as a novice craftsman who needs to be taught what an alloy is. [elrondshort|E] Half-elven is portrayed as a minor lord unfit for counsel and an oathbreaker.\n\nIt is infamously known by most scholars of repute as the Book of Lies, for it contains little else. Its authors have been lost to history, but some speculate that it was the work of [sauroncharacter|E] himself - or at least those in his employ. For who else could stand to benefit from such an abject distortion of the truth of history?"

It is said that this specific pearl was gifted to the Lord of the Havens by the young Ereinion during his tenure on the Isle. \n\nWhen Gil-galad did not return from [mordor|E] after the end of the [warlastalliance|E], Círdan held onto his friend's pearl as a keepsake - and forlorn memory of the last High King of [lindon|E]."

 cursed_sword_of_blacklocks_name: "Dumsuhersar" #Gloss
 cursed_sword_of_blacklocks_description: "Forged by Fullâ VII 'Flamehand', Dumsuhersar was forged of star-metal, with an appearance ashen yet containing a hidden fire. It was meant to be a signal of a new age for the [dwarves|E] of Bizarûldûm and a heirloom for the House of Thrár. Of such importance was his masterwork to him that Fulla VII wore the [Concept('greaterrings', 'rings')|E] of two [dwarven|E] clans while forging it - his own and that of his [stonefoot|E] kin on loan. It took him weeks of work, with little sleep and much agony. Yet in the end he wrought perhaps the greatest sword to ever be forged by the Dwarves of the East.\n\nBut it became an omen of doom, for but days after its completion, not one but three [dragons|E] descended upon Bizarûldûm. They sought the riches of the greatest mansion of the East, the hoards of two clans. The surprise of the [dwarves|E] was total, for until that time, no dragon had dared come so far south as the Rôisûri. Fulla VII valiantly faced down one of the dragons himself, with his royal guard surrounding him. With rings still on his fingers and Dumsuhersar in hand, he wounded it deeply but was incinerated along with the two rings. Dumsuhersar alone survived the dragon fire. His son Thrár IV rallied the [blacklocks|E] and Stonefoots, avenging his father and slaying the dragons. Yet he perished in the battles, and thus the royal line of Thrár was wiped out in Bizarûldûm. The Stonefoots retrieved Dumsuhersar in the aftermath but considered the blade accursed.

 forestel_description: "Forestel, 'Northern Hope', was the axe forged for Eldacar of [gondor|E], passed to his son Ornendil on his majority. Fashioned with [gondorian|E] steel by the best smiths in [osgiliathcity|E], it takes its design from the axes born by the Northmen of [rhovanion|E], Eldacar's maternal kin. It was meant to symbolise the combined strengths of both peoples, embodied in the prince."

 scroll_of_isildur_name: "Scroll of Isildur"
 scroll_of_isildur_description: "Long buried deep in the archives of [minastirith|E], this scroll was written by [isildur|E], who wished to leave an account of his finding of the [onering|E] in [gondor|E] before he left with it, bound for the road to [arnor|E] and his eventual death at the [gladdenfields|E]. It remains the only description of the physical properties of the One Ring and the writing upon it."

 statue_of_elros_description: "A beautiful marble statue of [elros|E], the first King of [numenor|E], crafted during the early days of the Kingdom of [gondor|E] to honour the memory of the [dunedain|E]'s sunken homeland and its past glory.

 aldarion_erendis_name: "Aldarion and Erendis"
 aldarion_erendis_description: "[elendil|E]'s own handwritten copy of the tale of Aldarion and Erendis, also called The Mariner's Wife. An old story, it describes the lives of Tar-Aldarion, the sixth King of [numenor|E], and his wife Erendis and how Aldarion's love of the sea eventually drove them apart. Indeed, Aldarion, whose grandfather had been the very first [numenorean|E] to lead an expedition to [middleearth|E], was enamoured with the sea. As a young man, before he became king, he founded the Guild of Venturers, which would go on to have a glorious future during the Númenórean colonisation of Middle-Earth. Erendis grew bitter towards Aldarion, and she withdrew to the sheep-lands of the countryside with their daughter Ancalimë, who remained their only child. Over time, Ancalimë, nicknamed the Princess Shepherdess, would inherit her mother's disdain for men. She would go on to become the first ruling Queen of Númenor, Tar-Ancalimë. This particular copy of the tale is the oldest still in existence; it even seems likely that Elendil wrote it in Númenor, before the [downfallofnumenor|E]."
 
 giant_bear_pelt_name: "Pelt of the Giant Bear of the Carrock"
 giant_bear_pelt_description: "This black, incredibly large pelt has been brought back from the Vales of [anduin|E]. It is said to be a trophy from the hunt of a massive bear lurking in the region of a large rock formation known to the locals as "The Carrock".\n\nThe hair around its head is uncommonly long and silky, and it bears silver and gold plaits, in the fashion of the chieftains of the region. Your antiquarian assumes this is a local custom: to plait the hair of remarkable bears in exchange for their protection.\n\nThis theory certainly makes sense, but you can't help but wonder at how #italic human #!this hair looks..."

 goblin_crown_name: "The Hammered Helm"
 goblin_crown_description: "After the Sacking of Imladris, a crude helm was created to celebrate the triumph. While the [goblins|E] hold that they melted down the swords of their hated foes to make it, it is more likely that they used whatever scraps of metal they could find. Regardless, the Helm remains a grim reminder of their overpowering force."
 
 fram_spear_name: "Spear of Fram"
 fram_spear_description: "This short, broad-headed spear is clearly of Dwarven make and design. It bears runes of prowess and of piercing, along with the name "Fram, son of Frumgar". Fram the Dragonslayer, lord of the [eothed|E], is renowned for defeating the wyrm Scatha and retrieving its great hoard. Whether this spear was used to fight the drake or originated from the dwarven treasure it guarded is uncertain."
 
 axe_faderda_name: "Axe of Faderda"
 axe_faderda_description: "This leaf-headed, discreetly engraved axe is believed to have belonged to Faderda, semi-mythical ancestor of the Woodsmen of [rhovanion|E]. Although its make is distinctly [sindarelves|E] in, the name "Faðerda" has been crudely carved in [cirth|E] runes upon the blade. Whether this inscription was added by Faderda himself or by a later owner to give weight to their claim remains unknown."

 narmacil_standard_name: "Narmacil II's Battle Standard"
 narmacil_standard_description: "When King Narmacil II of [gondor|E] marched against the Wairider army, his standard bearer flew high the royal standard of black velvet embroidered with [mithril|E] thread, catching the light of the sun and bringing hope to the [gondorian|E] soldiers.\n\nIt was therefore a profound humiliation to the grieving kingdom when, after the death of the king on the field of battle, the wainrider army displayed this glorious trophy on their war chief's tent.\n\nAfter Calimehtar defeated the Wainriders, the standard could not be found and disappeared from history."
 
 ondoher_campaign_bed_name: "Ondoher's Campaign Bed"
 ondoher_campaign_bed_description: "This richly embroidered and gilded diwan was originally King Ondoher of [gondor|E]'s campaign bed. The patterns of the White Tree and winged crown in [gondorian|E] late royal style are easily recognisable.\n\nAfter the [gondorian|E] defeat at the Battle of the Morannon, the Wainriders looted the king's campaign train and took this beautifully crafted piece of furniture for their own. It was modified to integrate a backrest and serve as a diwan for the Wainrider general's war council.\n\nWhen the Wainrider army was finally defeated, the campaign bed was salvaged by a fleeing soldier and has seen various masters since."

 conquerors_war_chest_description: "Azernakh the Conqueror, first ruler of the Balchoth Empire, was famous for defeating all who opposed his inexorable march out of the eastern steppes of [rhun|E].\n\nThis ornate and gilded chest, massive but ingeniously crafted to be easily transported, received both the tribute from the new vassals and the broken crowns of the defeated would-be challengers.\n\nAzernakh's successors, more concerned with fighting [gondor|E] and consolidating their realm than endless conquest, forgot the chest deep inside their treasuries, and it was finally sold for a handsome sum to finance the war effort."

 laegrist_description: ""Keen Cleaver", a beautiful longsword crafted for Arador, the fourth Prince of Dol Amroth and long held by his descendants, Laegrist was traditionally gifted to the most skilled Swan-Knight to wield in times of war as a symbol of the Prince's power and reach.

 turann_name: "Turánn"
 turann_description: "In 1500 of the [secondage|E], Sauron befriended [celebrimbor|E] in the guise of [annatarcharacter|E], claiming to be sent by the Valar as an emissary. He presented the Elven lord with the design for an intricate mithril hammer, a tool with which ever greater marvels could be crafted. Celebrimbor, no stranger to fine works and beautiful creations, was amazed at the beauty and elegance of the idea, evidence of [annatarcharacter|E]'s incredible insights. Together they crafted the hammer, bonding in shared toil, or so the Elf thought.\n\nIt was with this hammer in hand that the heir of [feanor|E] would lead the Gwaith-i-Mirdain in their greatest work, which would eventually become the [ringsofpower|E].\n\nA smith could craft wonders, equipped with such a tool."
 
 nardring_name: "Nardring"
 nardring_description: "Nardring, meaning 'Fire-hammer', is one of the hammers of the great craftsman [feanor|E], and the only one to make the journey with him to [middleearth|E]. It was not his only hammer, and indeed, not the one which purportedly was used in the forging of the [silmarils|E]. However, this hammer was ideally sized for travelling and was said to have been gifted to him by his teacher Mahtan upon the ending of his apprenticeship. As a result, this hammer was the one most often found on [feanor|E]'s person during his travels around [valinor|E] and was brought with him into exile.\n\nIt is one of the few personal objects of [feanor|E]'s to survive the [firstage|E] in the Hither Lands, eventually making its way into the possession of Celebrimbor before being lost during the [waroftheelvesandsauron|E].\n\nA smith could craft wonders, equipped with such a tool."
 
 azaghal_helmet_name: "Helm of Azaghâl"
 azaghal_helmet_description: "The helm of Azaghâl, forged in the fiery forges of [belegost|E], is a masterpiece of [dwarven|E] craftsmanship. Forged with the purest and most resilient [mithril|El], this helmet possesses an imposing and elegant structure that reflects the fierce determination of its wearer. The crest and reliefs on the surface of the helmet are finely adorned with intricate Dwarven motifs that recount the deeds and bravery of Azaghâl in the struggle against the forces of [morgothcharacter|E]. On the forehead, an embedded gem radiates a subtle light, reminding of Azaghâl's connection to the depths of the earth and the ancestral craftsmanship of his people."
 
 lesser_ring_name: "Lesser Ring"
 lesser_ring_description: "Wrought in Eregion by the [noldorelves|E] smiths of the Gwaith-i-Mirdain as essays in the craft, the lesser rings, while nowhere as powerful as the [ringsofpower|E], were nonetheless works of wonder and magic to the people of later ages."

 nimphelos_description: "A huge pearl, the size of a dove's egg, that was found along the shores of the Isle of Balar by the Falathrim. Círdan gave it, along with many lesser pearls, to his friend and ally Thingol.

 royal_standard_cardolan_description: "Commissioned by King Thorondor the Magnificent, the Royal Standard of [cardolan|E] had the banner of the royal family fly from a mighty golden staff topped with Thorondor himself, the King of All Eagles.\n\nThis magnificent standard was lost during the internecine wars among the [arnorian|E] successor states, with the later Princes of Cardolan making do with a lesser recreation.\n\nThough all that remains of the original artifact is the standard pole, a new flag has been made to replace the old one."
 
 sceptre_of_umbar_name: "Sceptre of Umbar"
 sceptre_of_umbar_description: "An ivory sceptre inlaid with fine worked gold and jewels.\n\nThe office of the Governor of [umbar|E] was one appointed directly by the [numenorean|E] Crown. Often these were powerful nobles or military officers. As the symbol of their office, they received a scepter of ivory, carved and inlaid with gold and jewels. In the carvings were oaths of fealty and loyalty to the Numenorean throne, as well as a curse if its holder should ever betray the faith of the rightful king.\n\nAfter the [downfallofnumenor|E], it became the badge of office for the Lord of Umbar, the elected leader of the [black_numenoreans|E] in the Council of Umbar. The Scepter was lost during Eärnil I’s conquest of Umbar. Later Umbarean legend claimed it was destroyed by Eärnil personally, the king saying that there could be but one scepter in [middleearth|E]."
 
 crown_of_herumor_name: "Crown of Herumor"
 crown_of_herumor_description: "A heavy crown of gold, the Crown of Herumor was the symbol of the Black Numenorean king of the same name.\n\nThe crown was created shortly after Herumor’s takeover of the former [numenorean|E] outposts of Harnendor as well as his annexation of the [haradrim|E] tributary kingdom of Amrûn. Heavy and ill-fitting, the crown in many ways is symbolic of Herumor’s reign. Its craftsmanship is middling by Numenorean standards, being a rush job. The crown was lost with the swift fall of his kingdom."

 crown_of_fuinur_name: "Crown of Fuinur"
 crown_of_fuinur_description: "A composite crown of silver, gold, and bronze, the Crown of Fuinur was the symbol of the [black_numenorean|E] king of the same name.\n\nThe crown was created by Fuinur melting down the crowns of the petty kings of later Pezarsan, a symbol of their submission to his new kingdom. The new crown was unique, but the elements did not blend well and were considered by some to be ugly. It was lost with his kingdom."
 
 badge_mirdain_name: "Badge of the Gwaith-i-Mírdain"
 badge_mirdain_description: "An elegant star wrought of [mithril|El] and inlaid with a gem in its center. These badges were the symbols of membership in the Gwaith-i-Mírdain of [eregion|E] and granted access to its resource stores and specialized laboratories. It was customary for a new member of the Guild to make the badge themselves before presenting it for approval."
 
 gilded_armour_of_imrazor_name: "Gilded Armour of Imrazôr"
 gilded_armour_of_imrazor_description: "More a showpiece than practical protection, this armour was bequeathed to Prince Imrazôr by his father, Ar-Sakalthôr, when he left [numenor|E] to take up his princely title. Wrought of gleaming silver and inlaid with [mithril|E] and gold, it is a stunning example of Numenorean artistry, incorporating many of its common motifs, such as ships, waves, and stars. Of particular note is a great jewel inset in the center of the chest, carved into the shape of the Star of Earendil.\n\nThe armour was inherited and then borne by Imrazôr's eldest legitimate son, Adûnaphazôr, following his death. However, when Adûnaphazôr falls in battle, the armour was subsequently lost to the ages."
 
 galvorn_armour_name: "Galvorn Armour"
 galvorn_armour_description: "This suit of chainmail is made of a strange metal: it is light as a feather, yet stronger than normal steel, and shines black as jet. Scholars maintain it is made of Galvorn, the fabled metal invented by Eöl the Dark Elf. Only one such armour is known to have been crafted, by Eöl for his own use. He was wearing it when cast from the walls of Gondolin for murdering his wife, Aredhel."

 crown_of_imrazor_II_name: "Imperial Crown of Imrazor II"
 crown_of_imrazor_II_description: "Imrazor II, King of Gimilthani, is a polarizing figure in the history of the Balan-lai. Once, he was a great hero, valiantly leading the Princes against the ambitions of An-Balkumagan and repulsing them. Yet in his later years, he grew paranoid and ambitious in equal measure, deeply frustrated by the divisions among the Kharadunai and the stagnation of the Balan-lai. In time this led to a mighty war between the princes, Imrazor seeking to force the Balan-lai to kneel to his power, though Imrazor would ultimately lose it.\n\nTo symbolize his self-proclaimed mastery of the region, Imrazor commissioned a great crown at the start of the war. Fashioned in the style of the old colonial princes, it was meant to mark the impending rebirth of the unified Princedom of Zimrathani. Wrought of gold and silver, it had a star of mithril set on its brow - an indescribably rare metal in the southlands of Middle-earth, rumored to have come from Numenor of old. The crown would be lost with Imrazor's death, likely secreted away by an enterprising soldier. It was actually a point of distrust and intrigue for centuries after, as peddlers and princes alike would claim to either have, or know of, the crown's true location.\n\nIf it were to be found again, it would be a potent symbol indeed."

 fated_heir_name: "Martaryon"
 fated_heir_description: "[feanor|E] made for each of his sons a blade, but none greater than that of [maedhros|E]. For his heir, Feanor crafted a magnificent sword, larger than any other he made. While most of his sons' blades were simple, elegant, but finely crafted, the blade of Maedhros was different. Richly ornamented, it was no less deadly than its kin, but the very vision of it proclaimed to all its nature. A mighty jewel shaped in the winged star of [nolofinwe|E] was set in the cross guard, and it seemed to gleam with light as if a living flame was within it. In the pommel was set the Star of Feanor. For Feanor intended this blade to be a statement - that Finwe had but one true and rightful heir - Feanor. And so in turn did Feanor have but #bold one#! firstborn son, his own heir - Maedhros. By his design, Feanor meant to proclaim the continuity of the rightful authority of the Kingship of the Noldor, passed from father to son, regardless of whatever minor disagreements may arise. This was made clear in the blade's name: [Glossary('Martaryon','martaryon_gloss')]. It was a statement of trust and a proclamation of the wielder's lofty heritage - and that they were worthy of the power it granted.\n\nIt is perhaps fitting then, that the blade would disappear with Maedhros's own kingship. For when he was seized by [morgothcharacter|E] and set to torment on Thangorodrim, the blade too was taken, and cast into the vaults of [angband|E], whence it was not seen again."
