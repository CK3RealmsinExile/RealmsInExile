 nenya_name:0 "Nenya"
 nenya_description:0 "The Ring of Adamant and Ring of Water, [nenya|E] was wrought of [mithril|E] and set with a stone of adamant. Normally hidden, when revealed it burns bright, as a star upon the finger. In it is the power of preservation, protection, and concealment from evil. \n\nIt was given to Galadriel, and enabled her to increase her own power and to preserve [lothlorien|E] unstained by the ravages of time. There, an image of [aman|E] was preserved in [middleearth|E], and it was one of the strongest realms of the [elves|E]."

 vilya_name:0 "Vilya"
 vilya_description:0 "The Ring of Air, mightiest of the [threeringsofelvesshort|E], Vilya is a gold band with a sapphire set in it, and it softly glows with an inner light. In it is the ideal of healing, that the world might be mended from the marring. \n\nIt was originally borne by Gil-galad, before passing to [elrondshort|E]. In Vilya's domain there is an echo of the healing grace of [valinor|E], and by its power was Imladris preserved throughout the [thirdage|E]."

 narya_name:0 "Narya"
 narya_description:0 "The Red Ring, the Ring of Fire, Narya is a gold band with an angular ruby inset. It is imbued with the ideal of hope, inspiring others, particularly to resist tyranny, in addition to the standard power of preserving from the ravages of time. Originally borne by Gil-galad and then entrusted by him to Cirdan, the ring's longest bearer was [gandalfcharacter|E]. \n\nIt is speculated [celebrimbor|E] originally intended to bear [narya|E] himself. \n\n#TOLKIENQUOTE "Take this ring, master, for your labours will be heavy; but it will support you in the weariness that you have taken upon yourself. For this is the Ring of Fire, and with it you may rekindle hearts in a world that grows chill." — Círdan the Shipwright to Gandalf"

Wrought by [sauroncharacter|E] in the fires of Mount Doom, in it was poured his malice, his cruelty, and his desire to dominate all life. Amplifying power in accordance with the innate power of the bearer, it is treacherous for all but [sauroncharacter|E] to wield, for it is a part of him - he alone is its master. \n\nAll the [ringsofpower|E], including the [threeringsofelvesshort|E], [sevenringsofdwarvesshort|E], and [nineringsofmenshort|E], were bound to its fate, and if it were unmade, their power too shall fail. Only in Mount Doom can it be destroyed, in the heart of Sauron's realm. Such a little thing... \n\n#S One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.#!"

 sword_of_manwe_name:0 "Sword of Manwë"
 sword_of_manwe_description:0 "The blade of [manwecharactershort|E] (known to some as Námavalcad - 'Judgement of Lightning') refers to the weapon of the Elder King, the [valar|E] Manwë. Blazing like lightning given form, it is the incarnation of the final role of the Elder King as both judge and executor of the Law. Wielded in ancient days by Manwë himself, whole armies fell beneath its fury, withering and scattered like leaves before a mighty tempest.\n\nThe blade would not be seen again until the War of Wrath - when it was wielded by Manwë's herald, [eonwecharacter|E], who held it in his master's stead. It was with this blade that [morgothcharacter|E] was once more bested, and bound anew with chains to be brought before the Elder King in Máhanaxar. If it should be needed again before the End, it shall once more serve as the weapon of judgement to all those who would overturn the Law, and the Order of Eru.\n\n#TOLKIENQUOTE It came to pass that at last the gates of [utumno|E] were broken and its halls unroofed, and [melkorcharacter|E] took refuge in the uttermost pit. Thence, seeing that all was lost (for that time), he sent forth on a sudden a host of [balrogs|E], the last of his servants that remained, and they assailed the standard of Manwë, as it were a tide of flame. But they were withered in the wind of his wrath and slain with the lightning of his sword; and Melkor stood at last alone.#!"

 silmaril_name:0 "Silmaril"
 silmaril_description:0 "One of three [silmarils|E], gems of immense might and beauty. Crafted of the hard-crystalline substance silima as their shell and named after it, they were the masterworks of [feanor|E]. In their heart burned some of the Light of Valinor from the [twotrees|E]. After their fall, the [silmarils|E] were the only remaining remnant of the undwindled primordial light.\n\nBeautiful beyond measure, of worth beyond comprehension, all admired and desired them. Much of the great tales and tragedies of the [firstage|E] can be traced back to their creation and their later theft by [morgothcharacter|E], being the impetus of the [oathoffeanor|E]. In the end, the three were sundered, one finding its place in the sky, one in the heart of the earth, and the last in the keeping of the waters. \n\nIt is said that in the Last Days [feanor|E] shall gather them once more, break them, and by their light restore the [twotrees|E]."

 hyandolire_name:0 "Hyandolírë"
 hyandolire_description:0 "In the disquiet of [valinor|E], [feanor|E] forged each of his [sonsoffeanorshort|E] a blade to bear if the worst should come. Though relatively unadorned, few blades since compared to these masterworks of metallurgy. Each blade was subtly different, to correspond with each son's strengths and weaknesses. \n\nThe blade of [maglor|E] was Hyandolírë ([quenya|E]: Cleaving Song). The name was a reference to his great voice and its power, and it seemed to sing as it cut through the air. It was one of the few possessions of Maglor to remain in his keeping even after the end of the [firstage|E], and the only known survivor of the blades of Fëanor."

 ringil_description:0 "Forged in [valinor|E] by [fingolfin|E] during the preparations for the [exileofthenoldor|E], Ringil is said to have glittered like ice in the morning sun. It served the High King of the [noldorelves|E] well in his wars against [morgothcharacter|E] until the Dagor Bragollach.\n\nSeeing what he believed to be the complete ruin of his people, Fingolfin rode to [angband|E] to fight the Black Enemy in single combat. Though he wounded him grievously seven times, the Ñoldo king finally fell under Grond, the Hammer of the Underworld.\n\nIt was brought to Gondolin along with Fingolfin's remains by Thorondor, king of the Eagles. Though Morgoth's blood had made the blade brittle and unfit for combat, it was kept as an heirloom by Turgon, and saved from the ruin of Gondolin by Tuor."
 
 rop_name:0 "The Amazing Tale of the Rings of Power"
 rop_description:0 "Finely embossed, this book contains a great series of tales concerning the [secondage|E] of [middleearth|E], particularly the forging of the [ringsofpower|E], the [elves|E], and the [numenorean|E]. Painstakingly illumined and with brilliant illustrations, it is a work of great expense without doubt.\n\nTitled 'The Amazing Tale of the Rings of Power' and alternatively known as the 'Parma Túrëcormaron' (Q. "Book of the Rings of Power"), it is unlike any other work concerning the era. Much of its writings contradict the known facts of the era, and has a strange obsession with an alternate variant of the Lady Galadriel. The timeline is distorted and compressed, making it all but useless in cross referencing historical events. It has many strange digressions, such as devoting larges sections to the society of nomadic and surprisingly inhumane halflings. \n\nIt does claim to know the origins of both [mithril|El] and the means of making Rings of Power, though these have been decried by what [dwarves|E] and Elves alike have heard of it. It argues to possess an insight into the politics of late imperial [numenor|E], yet claims no Numenorean Empire existed before the rise of Ar-Pharazon.\n\nIn particular the piece seems to paint most Elves as highly incompetent, ranging from High-king Erenion Gil-galad's policies, Lady Galadriel's rage and arrogance, or Lord [celebrimbor|E] as a novice craftsman who needs to be taught what an alloy is. [elrondshort|E] Half-elven is portrayed as a minor lord unfit for counsel and an oathbreaker.\n\nIt is infamously known by most scholars of repute as the Book of Lies, for it contains little else. Its authors have been lost to history, but some speculate that it was the work of [sauroncharacter|E] himself - or at least those in his employ. For who else could stand to benefit from such an abject distortion of the truth of history? "

It is said that this specific pearl was gifted to the Lord of the Havens by the young Ereinion during his tenure on the Isle. \n\nWhen Gil-galad did not return from [mordor|E] after the end of the [warlastalliance|E], Círdan held onto his friend's pearl as a keepsake - and forlorn memory of the last High King of [lindon|E]."

 cursed_sword_of_blacklocks_description:0 "Forged by Fulla VII 'Flamehand', Dumsuhersar was forged of star-metal, with an appearance ashen yet containing a hidden fire. It was meant to be a signal of a new age for the [dwarves|E] of Bizarûldûm, and a heirloom for the House of Thrár. Of such importance was his masterwork to him, Fulla VII wore the [Concept('greaterrings', 'rings')|E] of two Dwarven clans while forging it - his own, and that of his [stonefoot|E] kin on loan. It took him weeks of work, with little sleep and much agony. Yet in the end he wrought perhaps the greatest sword to ever be forged by the Dwarves of the East.\n\nBut it became an omen of doom, for but days after its completion, not one but three [dragons|E] descended upon Bizarûldûm. They sought the riches of the greatest mansion of the East, the hordes of two clans. The surprise of the Dwarves was total, for until that time, no dragon had dared come so far south as the Rôisûri. Fulla VII valiently faced down one of the dragons himself, with his royal guard surrounding him. With rings still on finger and Dumsuhersar in hand, he wounded it deeply, but was incinerated along with the two rings. Dumsuhersar alone survived the dragon fire. His son Thrár IV rallied the [blacklocks|E] and Stonefoots, avenging his father and slaying the dragons. Yet he perished in the battles, and thus the royal line of Thrár was wiped out in Bizarûldûm. The Stonefoots retrieved Dumsuhersar in the aftermath, but considered the blade accursed. It's creation had seemingly brought nigh utter ruin upon what was once the greatest of the mansions of the East. Due to their newfound [Concept('successionofbizaruldum', 'feud')|E] with the Blacklock cadet branch of Nargubraz, the Stonefoots of Bizarûldûm opted to send the blade to Thrár's southern line in the Yellow Mountains. There it became the heirloom of their line, and would remain in their keeping.\n\nA folk legend later developed among the Dwarves of Bizarûldûm, saying, "the Old Line shall rule again when the North-Hammer reforges the blade of woe, cleansing it by gold."

 ulukai_description:0 "The Ulûkai (Or."Serving Unlight") is an orcish artifact, an unholy gem belived to have been crafted after one of the three Silmarils was stolen from Morgoth as a replacement. But the jewel sorely disappointed Morgoth, for it could not replace that which he had lost, for the jewel seemed to consume light, not give it. Enraged and embittered, the Dark Lord cast it into the Vaults of Angband, and it was one of the few artifacts saved from the end of the War of Wrath by orcs who fled east during the fall of Angband. It was lost during the Great Northern War with Durin's Folk, but would be rediscovered by Skorg, the first Orc-Lord of Gundabad, during the Sack of Gundabad. \n\nThe Gem itself is believed to hold of some of the dark essence of Morgoth's evil spirit and whisper cruel wisdom to its bearer. The holder of the Ulûkai is believed by the Orcs of the North to have the right and destiny to rule the Northern parts of Middle Earth as Ashdurbúk."

Eight beautifully illuminated copies of the document were created - one for each of the seven children, and one to be sent back to Numenor for safe-keeping, record, and the Sceptre's approval (which was granted).\n\nWritten on vellum and bound with fine leather, the front cover bore written in golden Tengwar, "The Grand Concordant of the Children of Imrazor", with a subscript reading "containing the agreements, boundaries, and laws by which their inheritances shall be bound".

 crown_of_imrazor_II_description:0 "Imrazor II, King of Gimilthani, is a polarizing figure in the history of the Balan-lai. Once, he was a great hero, valiantly leading the Princes against the ambitions of An-Balkumagan and repulsing them. Yet in his later years, he grew paranoid and ambitious in equal measure, deeply frustrated by the divisions among the Kharadunai and the stagnation of the Balan-lai. In time this led to a mighty war between the princes, Imrazor seeking to force the Balan-lai to kneel to his power, though Imrazor would ultimately lose it.\n\nTo symbolize his self-proclaimed mastery of the region, Imrazor commissioned a great crown at the start of the war. Fashioned in the style of the old colonial princes, it was meant to mark the impending rebirth of the unified Princedom of Zimrathani. Wrought of gold and silver, it had a star of mithril set on its brow - an indescribably rare metal in the southlands of Middle-earth, rumored to have come from Numenor of old. The crown would be lost with Imrazor's death, likely secreted away by an enterprising soldier. It was actually a point of distrust and intrigue for centuries after, as peddlers and princes alike would claim to either have, or know of, the crown's true location.\n\nIf it were to be found again, it would be a potent symbol indeed."

 fated_heir_name:0 "Martaryon (Fated Heir)"
 fated_heir_description:0 "[feanor|E] made for each of his sons a blade, but none greater than that of [maedhros|E]. For his heir, Feanor crafted a magnificent sword, larger than any other he made. While most of his sons' blades were simple, elegant, but finely crafted, the blade of Maedhros was different. Richly ornamented, it was no less deadly than its kin, but the very vision of it proclaimed to all its nature. A mighty jewel shaped in the winged star of [nolofinwe|E] was set in the cross guard, and it seemed to gleam with light as if a living flame was within it. In the pommel was set the Star of Feanor. For Feanor intended this blade to be a statement - that Finwe had but one true and rightful heir - Feanor. And so in turn did Feanor have but *one* firstborn son, his own heir - Maedhros. By his design, Feanor meant to proclaim the continuity of the rightful authority of the Kingship of the Noldor, passed from father to son, regardless of whatever minor disagreements may arise. This was made clear in the blade's name: Martaryon, Fated Heir. It was a statement of trust and a proclamation of the wielder's lofty heritage - and that they were worthy of the power it granted.\n\nIt is perhaps fitting then, that the blade would disappear with Maedhros's own kingship. For when he was seized by [morgothcharacter|E] and set to torment on Thangorodrim, the blade too was taken, and cast into the vaults of [angband|E], whence it was not seen again."

These bolts were extraordinarily heavy and tough, capable of breaking stone or plate armor. No mannish lance could compare to the raw penetrating power of it. It required such power, for these were weapons designed with one purpose - to pierce scale and slay [dragons|E].\n\nLong did the dwarves feud with the [drakes|E], and nowhere more fiercely than in the far north, and the Grey Mountains. Though not all Dragons fly, many did, and the Dwarves, short but ingenious, soon devised a means of striking their foes from the skies - the Windlance. On account of the power they had to hurl their bolts with, Windlances were large and unwieldy, but functioned well as static defenses.\n\nThis is a lance from one such weapon - it has evidently seen use, and remains heavy enough a man might use it as a sort of club if pressed. Wrought of black iron, some have also named such bolts the ‘black arrows’ of the Dwarves."

 turann_description:0 "In 1500 of the [secondage|E], Sauron befriended [celebrimbor|E] in the guise of [annatarcharacter|E], claiming to be sent by the Valar as an emissary. He presented the Elven lord with the design for an intricate mithril hammer, a tool with which ever greater marvels could be crafted. Celebrimbor, no stranger to fine works and beautiful creations, was amazed at the beauty and elegance of the idea, evidence of [annatarcharacter|E]'s incredible insights. Together they crafted the hammer, bonding in shared toil, or so the Elf thought.\n\nIt was with this hammer in hand that the heir of [feanor|E] would lead the Gwaith-i-Mirdain in their greatest work, which would eventually become the [ringsofpower|E].\n\nA smith could craft wonders, equipped with such a tool."

However, this hammer was ideally sized for travelling and was said to have been gifted to him by his teacher Mahtan upon the ending of his apprenticeship. As a result, this hammer was the one most often found on [feanor|E]'s person during his travels around [valinor|E], and was brought with him into exile.\n\nIt is one of the few personal objects of [feanor|E]'s to survive the [firstage|E] in the Hither Lands, eventually making its way into the possession of Celebrimbor before being lost during the [waroftheelvesandsauron|E].\n\nA smith could craft wonders, equipped with such a tool."

The crest and reliefs on the surface of the helmet are finely adorned with intricate Dwarven motifs that recount the deeds and bravery of Azaghâl in the struggle against the forces of [morgothcharacter|E].

In the carvings were oaths of fealty and loyalty to the Numenorean throne, as well as a curse if its holder should ever betray the faith of the rightful King.\n\nAfter the [downfallofnumenor|E], it became the badge of office for the Lord of Umbar, the elected leader of the [black_numenoreans|E] in the Council of Umbar.

Wrought of gleaming silver and inlaid with [mithril|E] and gold, it is a stunning example of Numenorean artistry, incorporating many of its common motifs, such as ships, waves, and stars. Of particular note is a great jewel inset in the center of the chest, carved into the shape of the Star of Earendil.\n\nThe armour was inherited and then borne by Imrazôr's eldest legitimate son Adûnaphazôr following his death.
