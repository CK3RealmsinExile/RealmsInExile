 historical_char_creation_events.t.mythra: "The Maiden of the Dawn" 
 historical_char_creation_events.desc.mythra: "Word comes from the footsteps of the holy mountain of Mijore. Aloof from the chaos which has engulfed the land since the shadow passed back over the mountains to the north, from this holy place a girl has risen. All who meet her testify to her presence; her will blazes like a star, and her gaze piercing like the sun's rays. Her tongue may be gentle and warm in one minute, and exacting in harsh judgement the next. None can seem to hide a secret from her, and her uncanny knack for finding fair solutions to difficult problems have earned her many admirers. Already, many have begun to follow her throughout the land as she travels. As she goes, it seems as if wars quiet, raids end, and chaos recedes. In her wake she leaves law, justice, and reconciliation. The admiration of the mighty and the meek alight buoy her. Many are saying she must assuredly be blessed by the Gods - mayhaps even one herself.\n\nHer name is Mythra."

 historical_character.mythra: "Saint Mythra was a great Queen of [khy|E], founding her realm during the early [thirdage|E] after the fall of Khailuza. She was renowned as Lawgiver and as an honest ruler, bringing about a brief golden age for the people of the region. After her disappearance one night in her 77th year of rule, she was declared a saint by some and a goddess by others, revered or worshipped as the patron of light, law, and truth. Her cult would later go on to be one of the more prominent in later Arienist circles, where her similarity with the Sun Goddess saw her canonised as a favoured saint and emissary."
