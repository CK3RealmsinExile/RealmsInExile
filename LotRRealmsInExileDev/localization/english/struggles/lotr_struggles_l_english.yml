 balrog_struggle.0001.desc:0 "Though the Dwarves knew it not, a darkness lurked beneath the deepest depths of [khazaddum|E]. A [balrog|E] of Morgoth. Historically awakened in T.A. 1980 by the delving of the Longbeards for [mithril|E] under Durin VI, it slew the Dwarf-king and was thereafter known as Durin's Bane.\n\n$balrog_struggle_desc$"

 balrog_struggle.0002.t:0 "Durin's Bane Falls"
 balrog_struggle.0002.desc:0 "To the shock and amazement of all, Durin's Bane, the [balrog|e], has fallen at the hands of [balrog_contender.GetName].\n\nLong had the Balrog cast its shadow over the ancient Dwarf-realm of [moria|E], and few dared to brave its depths, allowing Goblins and Orcs to infest it. It was derided by many as foolhardy to try to reclaim the realm, deeming only a greater power than mere mortals able to accomplish the task. Yet [balrog_contender.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] has proven such doubts wrong.\n\n"
 balrog_struggle.0002.desc.dead:0 "Alas, like those few that have slain a Balrog before [balrog_contender.GetHerHim], [balrog_contender.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] did not make it out of the fateful battle alive. For as the Balrog fell, it caught [balrog_contender.GetHerHis] leg with one last crack of its whip, sending them both tumbling to their deaths in the bowels of the Earth. Lost. Forever."
 balrog_struggle.0002.desc.alive:0 "[balrog_contender.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] has crowned [balrog_contender.GetHerHim]self King of Moria, and already Dwarves from across the world speak of the need of colonists for the kingdom, and of the riches which are yet to be reclaimed.

 balrog_struggle.0002.desc.maglor:0 "Maglor Fëanorian, in a brazen display of Elven might, led a host into the depths of [khazaddum|E], seeking to reclaim it for the Dwarves. Upon confronting the Balrog, a great battle of arms and song erupted, until at last the Elves claimed victory over the Valaraukar. With its fall, many of the goblins that inhabit the depths have fled to the distant corners of the mountains, fleeing the radiant armies of the Elves. The ones that remain now face the might of the Elves who are set to the grim task of cleansing every depth and crevice.\n\nWith this unexpected turn, the North is set to change forever once again."

Rumors say that their leader has been baptized in the dark flame of the [balrog|E], and made its foremost servant. Why it would suddenly do this, none can say, but this union between both parties has resulted in a dangerous new power.\n\nThe world will watch wearily to see what the Servants of the Dark Flame now will do..."

Malice and wrath pours out towards me no less harrowing than the heat.\n\nI hurridly make for the exit, but have little hope. There is a mighty roar and a few great stomps.

 balrog_struggle.1011.desc:0 "Long have we labored, and now all is ready.\n\nEven if taken by surprise while slumbering, Durin's Bane will not fall lightly. It slew countless [dwarves|E] in the fall of [khazaddum|E], and there is not a Dwarf-realm of its like in the world today.\n\nYet we have chosen the hard route, through shadow and flame, that we might avenge all our fallen and bring about a new dawn to these shadowed halls. Many tears have been shed, many friends have been lost to bring us to this point.\n\nWe stand now on the precipice of its slumbering lair - if we cross the threshold, there is no going back."

Some innocuous, and just as many not so.\n\nI walk through a lower level of the hold, a small lantern my sole light. So far down, few venture here these days. And for good reason. The very shadows seem disquiet, and at times even feel malicious.\n\nI hear a distant noise, but cannot pinpoint the direction! A shiver runs down my spine, as I spin and hurridly move my head to and fro, desperate to find the source of the noise.\n\nYet for all my searching, I find naught - yet the shadows feel even deeper than before."

My whistle stops, for my heart has seemingly lept into my throat! Diving behind a doorway, I close my eyes as the malice in the air grows thicker, the temperature spiking.\n\nAfter a time it seems to disappate, and I hurridly make in the opposite direction. Yet in my panic, my eyes paid little attention to the ground. Tripping over a bit of broken masonry, I hit the ground hard, letting out a groan of pain. I struggle to my feet, but not without injury."

Several tunnels collapsed as the heat of the Balrog weakened the rock, and many buildings were casually destroyed in its wake.

After a furious discussion between architects, engineers, and stonesingers, eventually plans are drawn up to rebuild and reinforce the buildings in [selected_county.GetNameNoTooltip].\n\nYet looking at the plans, the sheer labor and gold required to reinforce the existing structures, let alone to rebuild the destroyed, makes me feel faint!

Yet long experience in [moria|E] lets even the dullest guess as to what the text and images refer to - the [balrog|E].\n\nWas it one of my own people, gone mad? A goblin?

It is said that some go missing in the nights, never to be seen again.\n\nYet there seems to be a common connection, the story says. These rumors argue the Balrog has taken and slain them, dragging them off in the depths of night. The reasoning being that the disappearences have purportedly happened at the hours when the Balrog is believed to be most active.\n\nThere isn't much information to go on, ultimately, and the Balrog is hardly the only danger in the depths. Whatever the reason, the rumors have grown to the point of detriment, so action must be taken."

This cult allegedly holds that the Balrog is not a demon, but indeed is the flames of the earth given form, an emissary of Mahal! The rumors claim the Balrog's judgement was due to the indolence and sloth of the old kings of [khazaddum|E]. If the faithful accept its judgement and repent, it will spare us, and bring prosperity undreamt of to [khazaddum|E]..."

As such, these relics are set apart for careful preservation or perhaps one day even restoration.\n\nTo the appall of all in [selected_county.GetNameNoTooltip], some of these artifacts have been discovered removed from their fellows, shattered as if thrown to the ground with a great force! Some of the craftsmen in my realm think they can restore the relics, but warn that it will cost both time and gold - and that even if successful, they will never be what they once were."

They are both inspiration and comfort to my people, reminders of the rightness of our cause in reclaiming the depths.\n\nThat is why it is a heavy blow to discover a section of [selected_county.GetNameNoTooltip] with nearly all of its statues toppled or cracked. The area bears the telltale signs of the Balrog's callous stride, knocking over the statues of our kin!\n\nWhile they could be rebuilt with time and effort, some argue that it would take time and resources I can ill afford to dedicate to vanity. They argue that the statues should be left as they are, as both warning and memorial to all those who have fallen to the Balrog's callousness."

It has now been almost two weeks since they left, and a week since they should have returned. Many in the court whisper that it must surely be the Balrog - or perhaps goblins? The court fears that if I send further expeditions, they will suffer a similar fate, and are now counseling me that I should put a hold on any further expeditions."

They think it must surely be the Balrog's influence, reaching even into their dreams - warning them away from this place. They ask now for my counsel and guidance. \n\nHow should they interpret these dreams? How should they respond to them? For they hold them a portent too dire to ignore..."

They are doing the bare minimum required to survive, but otherwise huddle in dark corners and pray to [CHARACTER.GetFaith.HighGodName] for safety and deliverance.
