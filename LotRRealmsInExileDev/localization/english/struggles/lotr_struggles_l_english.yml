The reasoning being that the disappearences have purportedly happened at the hours when the Balrog is believed to be most active.\n\nThere isn't much information to go on, ultimately, and the Balrog is hardly the only danger in the depths.

The rumors claim the Balrog's judgement was due to the indolence and sloth of the old kings of [khazaddum|E].

The area bears the telltale signs of the Balrog's callous stride, knocking over the statues of our kin!\n\nWhile they could be rebuilt with time and effort, some argue that it would take time and resources I can ill afford to dedicate to vanity.

It has now been almost two weeks since they left, and a week since they should have returned. Many in the court whisper that it must surely be the Balrog - or perhaps goblins?
