## Postcards from your Adventurer by Isabella Welch

#Rhûn

 fund_inspiration.6001.t:0 "The Steppe and saddle gallop through my heart,"
 fund_inspiration.6001.desc:1 "I have been riding for months on end. My rear shall never recover! I've acquired quite the taste for fermented mare's milk and nights beneath the open sky.\n\nWith this courier, I send a carved tip of a Morin Khuur — the decorative horse head placed atop instruments. Perhaps you have a use for it."
 fund_inspiration.6001.a:0 "I'll hold onto this!"
 fund_inspiration.6001.b:0 "Send it to the Court Musician."

#Harad Jungles

 fund_inspiration.6002.t:0 "My jaunt through the jungles marches on!"
 fund_inspiration.6002.desc:0 "I am near-blinded by all the gems the courts I visit have to show me. I find myself yearning for the filth of the open road.\n\nI have sent a courier with a particularly tasteless gift I was given — a Mûmak's head ornament on a ring, with jewels for eyes. Have you ever seen something so garish?"
 fund_inspiration.6002.a:0 "I rather like it, it's his loss."
 fund_inspiration.6002.b:0 "Ghastly! Take it apart and sell the gems."

#Harad Deserts

 fund_inspiration.6003.t:0 "I dream of the desert,"
 fund_inspiration.6003.desc:0 "My liege, my journey to the deserts of Haradwaith is underway, and I have joined a camel train traversing the width of the land.\n\nI send to you a piece of jewelry one of my fellow travelers granted me — a most delicate necklace covered in ostrich shell beads. I suppose you haven't seen an ostrich."
 fund_inspiration.6003.a:0 "A fine find! I will wear it myself."
 fund_inspiration.6003.b:1 "I shall give it to [event_spouse.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip]."

#Gondor

 fund_inspiration.6004.t:0 "The Southern Kingdom's roads"
 fund_inspiration.6004.desc:0 "My journey through Gondor has mostly involved passing along countless ruins on the roads.\n\nOft, in search of something of interest, I chance upon little trinkets. I have sent a courier bearing the tat your way. Perhaps it shall provide some amusement."
 fund_inspiration.6004.a:0 "What use is an adventurer who takes the common path?"
 fund_inspiration.6004.b:0 "These are some pretty baubles..."

#Westlands

 fund_inspiration.6005.t:0 "My adventures are sodden,"
 fund_inspiration.6005.desc:0 "My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], I have found a few trite relics so far in my adventures, which I have sent with this courier, but I am unsure what I may uncover next.\n\nThe Westlanders are the smelliest creatures I have encountered. As a child, I dreamt of the green and pleasant meadows, but I am convinced half of this world is made of mud. If you are a gracious liege, please send word to call me back."
 fund_inspiration.6005.a:0 "This isn't a holiday! Quest on!"
 fund_inspiration.6005.b:0 "Poor soul, I suppose these rewards shall suffice."
 fund_inspiration.6005.b.tt:0 "You permit [inspiration_owner.GetTitledFirstName] to return home"

#Rhovanion

 fund_inspiration.6006.t:0 "Greetings from Rhovanion,"
 fund_inspiration.6006.desc:0 "My travels throughout Rhovanion have left me with quite a taste for honeycakes and Esgaroth pike, and I have sent some recipes along with this courier.\n\nI have been given a golden brooch adorned with a horse by one of my hosts, which I also send to you. I'm certain my travels will bring further wonders in due time."
 fund_inspiration.6006.a:0 "Order our chefs to prepare these dishes at once!"
 fund_inspiration.6006.b:0 "[inspiration_owner.GetSheHe|U] seems to be having too much fun on this quest..."
 
 #Elven Woods
 
 fund_inspiration.6007.t:0 "The mysterious Elven woods,"
 fund_inspiration.6007.desc:0 "My journey through the woods of Elves has been both bewildering and entrancing. Though I have yet to meet one of those magical and secretive beings, I can hear their beautiful songs coming from high in the trees and occasionally find traces of their passage.\n\nPlease find in this missive a silver chain I found by the roadside, assuredly of Elven crafting."
 fund_inspiration.6007.a:0 "Such a fine present! I will wear it myself."
 fund_inspiration.6007.b:1 "It will look lovely around [event_spouse.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip]'s neck."
 
 #Orc Territory
 fund_inspiration.6008.t:0 "Deep in Orc territory,"
 fund_inspiration.6008.desc:0 "It is through no small danger to my own safety that I report my progress to you, my liege. The Orcs who dwell in these lands are a foul breed, smelly and hideous to gaze upon.\n\nI have narrowly escaped capture after taking this shiny trinket from one of their camps.\n\nI would advise to prepare your men, should these fearsome hordes ever reach our lands!"
 fund_inspiration.6008.a:0 "You might be right, we need to be ready."
 fund_inspiration.6008.b:0 "Pah! These "Orcs" are far away, I don't believe they could so terrible."
