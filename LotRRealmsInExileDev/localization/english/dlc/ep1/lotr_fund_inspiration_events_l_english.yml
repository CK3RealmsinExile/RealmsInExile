I know I must depart soon, but the libraries contain such an abundance of material that I fear by hastily leaving I might miss something of value that might aid in my adventure.\n\nI humbly request that you let me stay a while longer here so I may better explore the collection of lore the place has; some of these scrolls even date back hundreds of years, surely they must have some valuable insight!'"

It goes with everything and you must absolutely try it!'"
