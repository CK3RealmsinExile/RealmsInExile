 lotr_fund_inspiration.6534.desc:0 "'My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], I have arrived in [rivendell|E], and already I am taken by wonder. It is called 'The Last Homely House East of the Sea', and for good reason. The libraries are vast, the feasts are grand, the views are impeccable; any weariness that one might have melts away insantly! I know I must depart soon, but the libraries contain such an abundance of material that I fear by hastily leaving I might miss something of value that might aid in my adventure.\n\nI humbly request that you let me stay a while longer here so I may better explore the collection of lore the place has; some of these scrolls even date back hundreds of years, surely they must have some valuable insight!'"
