 fp1_trade_events.0002.desc:0 "As my troops and I prepare to sack the lands of [county.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip], our first scouts report back.\n\nIt seems the local towns are rich, but many are heavily fortified, and we could well be caught out by vengeful armies before we can break into the juiciest targets.\n\nAll is not lost: the art of good raiding is all in exploiting opportunity, and we could perhaps arrange trade and tribute in exchange for staying our blades."
 fp1_trade_events.0002.a:0 "Perhaps the local [county.GetHolder.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] will be amenable?"

 fp1_trade_events.0002.b:0 "A truce with the ruling [county.GetHolder.GetTopLiege.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] could be invaluable..."

 fp1_trade_events.0003.t:1 "$fp1_trade_events.0000.t$?"
 fp1_trade_events.0003.desc:0 "A disorderly horde of bandits, pirates, and other heavily-armed scoundrels has entered [county.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip], led by [raider.GetFirstName]!\n\nAt first, my scouts thought them here to pillage, but an emissary from their [raider.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] claims that they would happily trade instead. Their force is rich in plunder, new and old, and this would give the locals a chance to buy exotic goods from across the world.\n\nThe subtext is clear. Trade under preferable terms and they will depart in peace, or reject their offer and they will take what they wish."

My raiders keep their weapons in their belts in [recipient.GetHerHis] lands, and [recipient.GetHerHis] subjects buy the exotic luxuries we take from less diplomatic realms.\n\nThe terms of our agreement have almost run their course, though, and many among my retinue are reluctant to give up their convenient trade contacts.\n\nPerhaps [recipient.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] would be open to an extension?"

It can be rare to see so many distant foreigners with hands unbound.\n\nThe leaders of such an expedition have managed to garner an audience to beg for patronage: an eloquent [priest.GetFaith.PriestNeuter] and a keen-minded merchant."

 fp1_trade_events.0031.desc:0 "The raiders of [raider.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] are a fearsome bunch, enough that I'm often thankful that we count each other as cautious friends rather than bloody enemies.\n\nOne of the more #EMP vicious#! of [raider.GetHerHis] minor terrors counted among their number is [warrior.GetFirstName], a reaver of no small repute.\n\nWhen [warrior.GetSheHe] asked for an audience, I was half-expecting an assassination attempt, but am #EMP pleasantly#! surprised to find the ambitious young warrior wishes to offer [warrior.GetHerHis] services."

My lands could use the touch of [partner.GetHerHis] veteran masons and carpenters, and though [partner.GetSheHe] is safe from my raiders, many others have no such arrangement.\n\nWith a little joint spending to facilitate the  transit of our servants, we could solve both of these problems together: [partner.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] sends skilled craftspeople to serve me for a time, and in return, I loan [partner.GetHerHim] elderly raiders and eager settlers as advisers to help keep [partner.GetHerHis] lands safe."
