This was once a burial cave in the days of twilight, yet either it has been raided, treasure hunters forcing their way into each stone coffin, or the undead inside have forced their way out.\n\nI feel the air in my lungs freeze. One of my retinue, walking ahead of the group, drops to the ground; around their leg wraps the rotten flesh of a wight's hand.\n\nWith hollow eyes its face stares at me."
