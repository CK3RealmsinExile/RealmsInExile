 ep3_laamp_decision_event.1000.desc_intro_returned_minas_tirith_01:0 "As I stand atop the sixth level of [visiting_location.GetBaronyNameExplicitlyNoTooltip], I am still a bit breathless. Breathing in deeply, I look out. The Citadel and White Tower loom over me, and the lower levels of the city are abuzz with activity. The plains surrounding the city stretch far off, ending at the mighty Anduin. The shadowy peaks of the Ephel Dúath are faintly visible in the distance."
 ep3_laamp_decision_event.1000.desc_intro_minas_tirith:0 "We enter [visiting_location.GetBaronyNameExplicitlyNoTooltip] through the great gate, past the sable and smooth outer wall, into the main courtyard. It ends at a great wall of stone that thrusts forth from a mountain, and we quickly make our way up the levels of the city, each one surrounded by a white wall through which there is only one entrance. It is no surprise that the White City is an object of much desire, majestic in its own right, and nigh impregnable to all but the most determined assailants."
