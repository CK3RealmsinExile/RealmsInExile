We should build a #italic dakhma#!, a Tower of Silence, where the dead can be securely housed, exposed to dogs and carrion birds, until only dust remains.""

But this tower is old and crumbling, and there is concern that corpse matter has been seeping out, polluting the three sacred elements."\n\n"The local people would very much appreciate if we helped them construct a new tower, where their dead can dwell secure.""

"The purest and greatest of all flames would be #italic Atash Behram#!, the Fire of Victory, born from lightning among the clouds.

 fp3_yearly.8052.desc: "The [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.AltPriestTermPlural] have been constantly reminding me of my pledge to find a Fire of Victory for the temple in [sacred_fire_province.GetName]. Not that I have forgotten... I sent out scouts in all directions to look for a thunderstorm, to look for a sign from [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetFaith.HighGodName]. But lightning proved elusive.\n\nYet now I stand just outside my [ROOT.Char.Custom('ResidenceBuilding')], as thunder booms in the distance and bolts of lightning jumps across the dark clouds. My servants scurry around, trying to catch the lightning on tall poles, while I gaze out across the land, looking for any hint of a flame. Our efforts are in vain - the clouds soon break up, and the lightning disappears into the high heavens.\n\n[ROOT.GetCharacter.GetFaith.HighGodName], is this truly your will? Shall I never find the fire I seek?"

 fp3_yearly.8053.desc: "Days and weeks have passed, my scouts scouring the realm for fire sprung from lightning, to no avail. Yet as I begin to grow despondent, suddenly dark clouds well up in the distance, a booming sound of thunder echoing from far away. I hurry out of my [ROOT.Char.Custom('ResidenceBuilding')] towards the storm, servants in tow, and indeed, it draws nearer, as if beckoned by an invisible hand.\n\nThen, right in front of me, bright light pierces the clouds and juts down like a spear from [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.DivineRealm], hitting a lonely tree. The dry wood ignites at once, burning with a white blaze, as pure as the #italic fravashi#! spirits. I have found it, the Fire of Victory. It came to me!"
