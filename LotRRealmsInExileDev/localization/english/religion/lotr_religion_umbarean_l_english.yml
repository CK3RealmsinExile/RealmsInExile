 ### Faiths of Umbar ###

 faith_creed_of_men: "Zâur an-Anî" #Juke note: Check Bellakar source doc. Someone originally wrote this loc as a melkor cult, but I think we can reflavor it into a mixed haradrim-adunaic faith with very little melkoric influence in Umbar ~TA 1000
 faith_creed_of_men_adj: "Zâur an-Anî"
 faith_creed_of_men_adherent: "Anî"
 faith_creed_of_men_adherent_plural: "Anîhin"
 faith_creed_of_men_desc: "In the darkest of corners of the old empire of Númenor, a tale is maintained. Mankind, in the dawn of the world, had been threatened by the Devourer, and saved only by the Lord of the Dark, who taught them out to subjugate it, and make it their servant. This Dark Lord was none other than He the Ârûwanâ ancestors named Mulkhêr. But though the Ârûwanâi had worshipped Him, they had failed. \n\nThe Nunazhme taught that the Poganin (Heathens/Unworthy, the Númenóreans) were corrupters of Men, and that through their own hubris they had destroyed themselves. Though right to acknowledge the Lord of the Dark, they had been led astray by their craven fear of Death, the Fate of Men, to make war on the [valargods|E]. [sauroncharacter|E], the Nunazhme believed, had set this temptation before the Poganin to test their worthiness. They failed the test. \n\nNow though, the Advocates of the Zâur an-Anî preach, the world was changing again. Soon the climactic battle shall come, and the faithful shall prove their devotion to the Lord of the Dark, and raise anew his ruined temple."

 faith_corsair: "Azrîyamanoi Creed" # The Spirits of the Sea
 faith_corsair_adj: "Azrîyamanoi"
 faith_corsair_adherent: "Azrîyala"
 faith_corsair_adherent_plural: "Azrîyalai"
 faith_corsair_desc: "Among the superstitious sailors of the Umbarean coast, a cult of two great sea spirits exists, known as the Azrîyamanoi. Malíciam, the lord of the deep, is a harsh lord, capricious in his actions and his deeds. He acts seemingly at random, and can flip between being a dear friend and a deadly foe in an instant. His wife, Uyuninêz, lady of calm waters, is a restraining force on his tempers and wills, but is the weaker of the two. To her sailors cry and make burnt offerings, and among the corsairs it is custom to bear a shrine to both of the great spirits on every ship.\n\nArising from the [numenorean|E] (and subsequent [black_numenorean|E] and [dunedain|E]) dominance of the region of [umbar|E] and the natives that lived there, the worship of Malíciam and Uyuninêz is a corrupted fusion of the [haradrim|E] fear of the sea god (Malíciam), and the Númenórean reverence for the [maiargods|E] of [ulmocharacter|E], [ossecharacter|E] and [uinencharacter|E]."
 
 faith_corsair_old: "Old Azrîyamanoi Creed"
 faith_corsair_old_adj: "Old Azrîyamanoi"
 faith_corsair_old_adherent: "Old Azrîyala"
 faith_corsair_old_adherent_plural: "Old Azrîyalai"
 
 faith_kolir: "Veneration of the Kôlir"
 faith_kolir_adj: "Kôlirî"
 faith_kolir_adherent: "Kôliran"
 faith_kolir_adherent_plural: "Kôlirai"
 faith_kolir_desc: "The Veneration of the Kôlir is a strange faith which arose in Mardrûak during the chaos of the later Third Age, arising as a mix between the folkloric worship of the Haradrim and the Bellakari Batân an-Izindi, which gained popularity amongst the Bellakarean Adûnai remnants of Mardrûak following the retreat of authority.\n\n The Kôlirî worship a pantheon of deities, who have inhabited the world since the beginning, and live in the uttermost west. From time to time they come among men, and their lives and deeds shape the course of history. These are worthy of praise and emulation."

 faith_castamiri_creed: "Creed of Castamir" 
 faith_castamiri_creed_adj: "Castamiri"
 faith_castamiri_creed_adherent: "Royalist"
 faith_castamiri_creed_adherent_plural: "Royalists"
 faith_castamiri_creed_desc: "Arising out of their long exile, the Castamiri Creed was developed by the dynasty of the same name. Pulling upon ancient Numenorean traditions of divine kingship, they incorporated many traditions and ceremonies from their indigenous Haradron subjects. The creed is simple, yet quite effictive as a result. The King, descended from the Gods and Heroes of Old, is their intermediary, crowned by them and entrusted with rule over the world of mortals in their stead. To challenge the rightful king was heresy, and to aid him was righteousness.\n\nThe followers of the Creed claim continuity with the ancient traditions of Numenor and of pre-kinstrife Gondor, but their syncretism with native Haradron traditions has resulted in many viewing such claims with skepticism."
