 faith_hillmen_adherent: "Dìleas à Sinnsear"
 faith_hillmen_adherent_plural: "Dìleas à Sinnsear"
 faith_hillmen_desc: "The Dìleas à Sinnsear (Faithful of their Ancestors) revere the spirits of their ancestors, who they believe watch over and influence the affairs of the living. Of great importance is honoring the family, and maintaining the shrines and tombs of the forefathers. Dereliction of this not only shows distain towards the living but also invites the retribution of the dead, and the forsaking of their protection against the Great Spirits.\n\nThe pious and wise reject service to the Great Spirits of light and darkness, deeming them to be at best uncaring of the lives and sorrows of mankind, and more often actively malicious towards them. Those which seem kindly act so in order to manipulate humans, never out of altruism. Rather, it is only through the maintenance of their ancestral shrines and offering sacrifices at them that an individual may live free from the dangerous influence of the Great Spirits, as their ancestors guard them from the next world and bless them."

 faith_westmen_adherent_plural: "Dìleas do Sinnsear an Iar"
 faith_westmen_desc: "The Dìleas do Sinnsear an Iar (Faithful of the Western Ancestors) revere the ancestral spirits, not only of the Noi Trevan, but also of the Iarfer (West-Men, their name for the [dunedain|E]). The importance of maintaining the rites for their own ancestors are maintained, but the Dìleas do Sinnsear an Iar place equal or even greater importance upon the reverance of the ancestors of the Iarfer, for the ancestors of the Iarfer are the Great Spirits!\n\nWhen the Iarfer introduced what the Noi Trevan would call the Ainfer ([ainurgods|E]), including the powerful Valfer and weaker Mefer, they misunderstood them to be their ancestors. This has lead to a sychrotism of various figures in Dúnedain theology being sychronized with their ancestors, with prominent examples such as Eru and Elros, Tar Minyatur and Manwe, and Elendil and Eönwë, to name a few."
