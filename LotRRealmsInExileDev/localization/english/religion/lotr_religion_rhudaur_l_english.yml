Dereliction of this not only shows distain towards the living but also invites the retribution of the dead, and the forsaking of their protection against the Great Spirits. \n\nThe pious and wise reject service to the Great Spirits of light and darkness, deeming them to be at best uncaring of the lives and sorrows of mankind, and more often actively malicious towards them. Those which seem kindly act so in order to manipulate humans, never out of altruism. Rather, it is only through the maintenance of their ancestral shrines and offering sacrifices at them that an individual may live free from the dangerous influence of the Great Spirits, as their ancestors guard them from the next world and bless them."
