Of great importance is honoring the family, and maintaining the shrines and tombs of the forefathers. Dereliction of this not only shows distain towards the living but also invites the retribution of the dead, and the forsaking of their protection against the Great Spirits.\n\nThe pious and wise reject service to the Great Spirits of Light and Darkness, deeming them to be at best uncaring of the lives and sorrows of [mankind|E], and more often actively malicious towards them. Those which seem kindly act so in order to manipulate humans, never out of altruism. Rather, it is only through the maintenance of their ancestral shrines and offering sacrifices at them that an individual may live free from the dangerous influence of the Great Spirits, as their ancestors guard them from the next world and bless them."

The importance of maintaining the rites for their own ancestors are maintained, but there is an equal or greater importance placed upon the reverance of the ancestors of the Iarfer, as they recognise the ancestors of the Iarfer as the Great Spirits their people feared.\n\nWhen the Iarfer introduced what the Noi Trevan would call the [Glossary('Ainfer','ainfer_gloss')], including the [Glossary('Rhai-Erthol','rhai_erthol_gloss')] [Glossary('Valfer','valfer_gloss')] and weaker [Glossary('Rhai-Erthol','rhai_erthol_gloss')] [Glossary('Mèfer','mefer_gloss')], whom they misunderstood to be their ancestors. This has lead to a sychrotism of various figures in [dunedain|E] theology being sychronized with important figures from their history, with prominent examples including [Glossary('Eil','eil_gloss')], [Glossary('Tigh Mòradh','tigh_moradh_gloss')], and [Glossary('Elan','elan_gloss')]."
