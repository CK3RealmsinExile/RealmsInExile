Honoring the family and maintaining the shrines and tombs of their forebears are of paramount importance. Neglecting this duty not only shows disdain toward the living but also invites the retribution of the dead, forsaking their protection against the Great Spirits.\n\nThe pious and wise reject service to the Great Spirits of Light and Darkness, deeming them to be at best uncaring of the lives and sorrows of [mankind|E], and more often actively malicious. Those which seem kindly act so in order to manipulate mortals, never out of altruism. Rather, it is only only through the maintenance of ancestral shrines and the offering of sacrifices that an individual may live free from the dangerous influence of the Great Spirits, as their ancestors guard them from the next world and bestow their blessings."

They uphold the rites for their own ancestors, yet place equal—or even greater—importance on revering the Iarfer forebears, whom they recognize as the very Great Spirits once feared by their people.\n\nWhen the Iarfer introduced what the Noi Trevan would call the [Glossary('Ainfer','ainfer_gloss')]—including the [Glossary('Rhai-Erthol','rhai_erthol_gloss')] [Glossary('Valfer','valfer_gloss')] and the weaker [Glossary('Rhai-Erthol','rhai_erthol_gloss')] [Glossary('Mèfer','mefer_gloss')], whom they mistakenly believed to be their own ancestors —they set in motion a syncretism within [dunedain|E] theology, aligning various ancestral figures with key heroes of their history, with prominent examples including [Glossary('Eil','eil_gloss')], [Glossary('Tigh Mòradh','tigh_moradh_gloss')], and [Glossary('Elan','elan_gloss')]."
