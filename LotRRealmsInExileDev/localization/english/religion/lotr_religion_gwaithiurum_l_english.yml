Worship of White-Hand endured even after the fall of the Black Tower, though it is revered alongside more traditional Dunlending spirits such as Tûrthalis."

Various rites and rituals are used to communicate with and placate these spirits.\n\nThe spirits of the Gwathló, the Isen, and the Great Sea are the most important of the Faeraign.

Kaz is the lord of the open sky, and it was his winds that whispered the first words into the ears of mankind, and so was speech born.

The result is a belief in a set of powerful ruling spirits, but if you listen to the tales and legends, they have had many more... flavorful and intriguing stories attributed to them not found in either Dúnedain or Elven sources."
