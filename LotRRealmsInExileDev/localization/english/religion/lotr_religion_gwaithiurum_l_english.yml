The result is a belief in a set of powerful ruling spirits, but if you listen to the tales and legends, they have had many more... flavorful and intriguing stories attributed to them not found in either Dúnedain or Elven sources."

Kaz is the lord of the open sky, and it was his winds that whispered the first words into the ears of mankind, and so was speech born. Even to this day, it is believed children are born who possesses a tenuous connection to these ancient, mighty spirits.
