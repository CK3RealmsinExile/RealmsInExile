Worship of White-Hand endured even after the fall of the Black Tower, though it is revered alongside more traditional Dunlending spirits such as Tûrthalis."

Thus the veneration of the Mòrdhamoraire, or Great Lords, began.\n\nThe worship of the Mòrdhamoraire essentially merges the Dúnedain knowledge of the Valar with the old folk-beliefs of the ancient Daen, with an emphasis on the importance of virtue and valor, even in the face of despair. The result is a belief in a set of powerful ruling spirits, but if you listen to the tales and legends, they have had many more... flavorful and intriguing stories attributed to them not found in either Dúnedain or Elven sources."
