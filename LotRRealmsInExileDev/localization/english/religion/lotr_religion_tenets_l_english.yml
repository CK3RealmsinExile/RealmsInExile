The winds, airs and birds are his servants, and his presence is felt wherever the four winds blow.

Beautiful beyond all words, light is her dominion, and everywhere the light of the stars shine she sees from her throne in the palaces of Ilmarin upon Taniquetil. From the beginning, she had been the most implacable foe of Morgoth, and she perceives most keenly the true nature of others. The very mention of her name is a curse upon evil, and she most amongst the powers is called upon for aid and strength in dire times. Amongst all the Powers, she might be said to be the true patron to any that stands resolute against the tide of Darkness.

His power dwells in the oceans and the rivers, and he is the most deeply instructed in the art of music, with it being said that an echo of the Music of the Ainur can be heard in the deeps of the ocean. He seldom involves himself in the councils of the Powers, preferring his undersea domains.

Yavanna is the Power responsible for the bounty of the fields, and she rejoices in the growing of plants.

If the world must experience sorrow, then let us mend it, and love each other." #Old Desc:Nienna Núri, the Lady of Mercy, is the mourner who cries tears for the world and its pains. In her is the ability to be steadfast in sorrow, courageous in grief, and to understand that such pain is natural, and that those that suffer should be comforted. In her is the pity, and the hope, that changes the world, the pity that the more jaded would call folly, the pity and hope that keeps believing that there is good that can be found and redeemed, even in deep darkness.

He rejoices in the hunt, both of animals and of evil. He alone roamed Middle-Earth during the Sleep of Yavanna, and he found the first Eldar at its end and led them to Valinor. He is terrible in his wrath, and his horn strikes terror into all evil that hears it.

Of all the Powers, Námo sees most clearly the Song in its entirety, the possible futures and the wangling ties of destiny that bind Arda together. He is the grimmest of the Powers and speaks rarely, and usually only at the prompting of Manwë his king.

The halls of Mandos are draped in these tapestries, and the halls grow ever bigger as the Story grows in time and depth.

Tulkas delights in deeds of prowess and strength, such as wrestling and fighting. But for all his warlike behaviour, he is far from dreadful; he laughs heartily in sports and war alike. He is a hardy friend, slow to anger but also slow to forgive. He should not be sought for counsel, for he lives in the present, not mindful of the lessons of the past. He is patron to warriors and those that engage in sports and contests of strength.

Among those who revere [vanacharacter|E], there is a belief that each generation has its own natural time and attempting to resist this is a disservice to both the young and old." #Old Desc: Vána the Ever-Young is the wife of Oromë, and she rejoices in the noontide of life and its fullness. Those that follow her tend to emulate the importance of the fullness of life, desiring to make the most of their youths and resentful of those that cling to power into old age, denying the younger generation their chance.
