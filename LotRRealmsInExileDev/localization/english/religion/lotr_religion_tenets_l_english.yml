The winds, airs and birds are his servants, and his presence is felt wherever the four winds blow.

Adherents of this faith love the stars deeply and are zealous foes of the Darkness." #Old Desc: Varda Elentári is the wife of Manwë, Queen of the Ainur, the Kindler, she who made the stars, most dearly beloved of the Valar amongst the Eldar. Beautiful beyond all words, light is her dominion, and everywhere the light of the stars shine she sees from her throne in the palaces of Ilmarin upon Taniquetil. From the beginning, she had been the most implacable foe of Morgoth, and she perceives most keenly the true nature of others. The very mention of her name is a curse upon evil, and she most amongst the powers is called upon for aid and strength in dire times. Amongst all the Powers, she might be said to be the true patron to any that stands resolute against the tide of Darkness.

His power dwells in the oceans and the rivers, and he is the most deeply instructed in the art of music, with it being said that an echo of the Music of the Ainur can be heard in the deeps of the ocean. He seldom involves himself in the councils of the Powers, preferring his undersea domains. Of all the Powers, he feels most keenly the pains of the Children through his waters, and alone of the Powers has never abandoned them. He is friend and patron foremost to those that dwell near his domain, coastal peoples, fishermen, and sailors.

Through the flourishing and bountiful earth, the followers of [yavannacharactershort|E] rejoice and praise their patronness." #Old Desc: Yavanna Kementári is the Queen of the Earth, the Giver of Fruits – in her domain lies all things which grow. She made the Two Trees after the destruction of the Lamps made by her husband, Aulë, and from her pleas for protection of her plants were born the Onodrim. Yavanna is the Power responsible for the bounty of the fields, and she rejoices in the growing of plants. She despairs in their destruction, counting them her children, although she begrudgingly accepts that the Children coming into their dominion shall do such. She is the patroness of the farmer and all agrarian workers.

Craftsmen and makers are highly respected, and the desire to learn burns fiercly among the followers of [aulecharacter|E]." #Old Desc: Aulë the Smith is the greatest craftsmen of the Ainur, the one who wrought the foundations of the earth and rose up the mountains. He rejoices in the making of things, but seeks not their dominion, rejoicing in collaboration and the teaching of others. The minerals and jewels of the earth are of his design, ornamentation of the greater creation. Aulë is the patron, teacher, and friend of all who desire to make without destruction or dominion, lord of craftsmen and builders.

  tenet_primacy_of_nienna_desc:0 "In this faith, the Valie [niennacharacter|E] shapes their understanding of the world, encouraging pity, kindness, and generosity towards all. If the world must experience sorrow, then let us mend it, and love each other." #Old Desc:Nienna Núri, the Lady of Mercy, is the mourner who cries tears for the world and its pains. In her is the ability to be steadfast in sorrow, courageous in grief, and to understand that such pain is natural, and that those that suffer should be comforted. In her is the pity, and the hope, that changes the world, the pity that the more jaded would call folly, the pity and hope that keeps believing that there is good that can be found and redeemed, even in deep darkness. She is the comforter of the bereaved and the deceased, the advocate for the condemned. All who suffer are her charge, and those that follow her take on a similarly heavy burden.

Hunting and riding have taken on an almost sacred nature among practitioners of this faith." #Old desc: Oromë Aldaron, the Great Rider, is the lord of wild beasts, the hunt, horses, riders, and dogs. He rejoices in the hunt, both of animals and of evil. He alone roamed Middle-Earth during the Sleep of Yavanna, and he found the first Eldar at its end and led them to Valinor. He is terrible in his wrath, and his horn strikes terror into all evil that hears it. Those that hear it know that the end was upon them, for none can escape the bow of Oromë once he has set it to strike down evil. He is the patron of horsemen and hunters, and dear friend to archers and foes of the Darkness.
  tenet_primacy_of_mandos_name:0 "Primacy of Mandos"
  tenet_primacy_of_mandos_desc:0 "In this faith, the Vala [namocharactershort|E] is an ever-present shadow looming over its practitioners.

Of all the Powers, Námo sees most clearly the Song in its entirety, the possible futures and the wangling ties of destiny that bind Arda together. He is the grimmest of the Powers and speaks rarely, and usually only at the prompting of Manwë his king. Mandos is patron to none but the dead, but those of powerful foresight might feel a small kinship to the Doomsman and the heavy weight he bears.

  tenet_primacy_of_vaire_desc:0 "In this faith, the Valie [vairecharacter|E] inspires the faithful in their quest to understand and learn from history." #Old Desc: Vairë is the wife of Namo of Mandos, and to her is charged the task of recording all the history of Arda, beginning to end, through her weavings. The halls of Mandos are draped in these tapestries, and the halls grow ever bigger as the Story grows in time and depth. She herself does not interfere with the Story, and thus, with the living, but loremasters and scholars look to her for inspiration and guidance.

Wrestling is a popular past-time, as are contests of strength." #Old Desc: Tulkas Astaldo was the last of the Ainur to descend into Arda, in order to aid his kin in their war against the Black Foe. Tulkas delights in deeds of prowess and strength, such as wrestling and fighting. But for all his warlike behaviour, he is far from dreadful; he laughs heartily in sports and war alike. He is a hardy friend, slow to anger but also slow to forgive. He should not be sought for counsel, for he lives in the present, not mindful of the lessons of the past. He is patron to warriors and those that engage in sports and contests of strength.

  tenet_primacy_of_vana_desc:0 "In this faith, the Valie [vanacharacter|E] inspires the young with her eternal youth. Among those who revere [vanacharacter|E], there is a belief that each generation has its own natural time and attempting to resist this is a disservice to both the young and old." #Old Desc: Vána the Ever-Young is the wife of Oromë, and she rejoices in the noontide of life and its fullness. Those that follow her tend to emulate the importance of the fullness of life, desiring to make the most of their youths and resentful of those that cling to power into old age, denying the younger generation their chance.
