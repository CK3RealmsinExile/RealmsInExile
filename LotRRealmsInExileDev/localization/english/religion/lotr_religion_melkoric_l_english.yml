 melkorite_desc: "[mulkhercharacter|E] created [conceptmankind|E] in His image, strong, beautiful, and immortal. Additionally, He crafted the world for them to inhabit. But the foul [avaloigods|E], jealous of Mulkhêr's works and his nobility, stole immortality from mankind. Slinking away to their fortress-land of the far west, they made the [eledaim|E] in their image as Mulkhêr had with mankind. Thus, did the Avalôi usurp the righteous place of mankind with their puppets, and in time this treachery cast down Mulkhêr himself, banishing him beyond the world. But the Great Lord shall come again, and the world's wrongs shall be righted, the false masters overthrown, and the dominion of Mankind shall come at last. \n\nThe worship of [morgothcharacter|E] was introduced to [numenor|E] through the treachery of [sauroncharacter|E], only becoming practiced there after the surrender and captivity of Sauron. Sauron became its High-Priest in the Great Temple of [armenelos|E], preaching his message of dark salvation to the fearful [numenoreans|E]. After the [akallabeth|E], the cult endured in some of the southern [adunaic|E] colonies of [middleearth|E] for a short while, with it all but dying out by the early [thirdage|E]."

In time the traditions of the pantheon were eroded. Replaced with rituals of dark sacrifice that revel in the infliction of torture and pain. \n\nAfter many successive generations of Tyrants ruled, the Adherents of Szrel no longer held reverence for any gods, but the void itself. Whose cruel embrace the most zealous adherents seek to avoid, striving through ever greater acts of tyranny to one day contact the Lord of the Dark.\n\nThe Dark Worship brooked no gods save the Dark Lord, with only the Void as an alternative to his reign."
