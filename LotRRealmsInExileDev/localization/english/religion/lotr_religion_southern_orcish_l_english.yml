 ################################

 southern_orcish_religion: "Southern Orc"
 southern_orcish_religion_adj: "Southern Orcish"
 southern_orcish_religion_desc: "Long removed from the Dark Lords of the north, the Orcs of the far south retain only a shadow of that memory. Their pantheons are filled with myriad dark spirits and demons worthy of both reverence and fear."
 southern_orcish_religion_adherent: "Orc"
 southern_orcish_religion_adherent_plural: "Orcs"

 volcano_cult: "Host of Ulkhásh"
 volcano_cult_adj: "Ulkháshukh"
 volcano_cult_adherent: "Ulkháshul"
 volcano_cult_adherent_plural: "Ulkháshuli"
 volcano_cult_desc: "The [orcs|E] of the [yellowmountains|E] hold great reverence and fear for the mountains of fire that dot the land. In their telling, these fire-mountains were first raised by the war god Ulkhásh, as a weapon to destroy his eternal enemies, the vile [dwarves|E]. Though his flames struck a great blow against the [blacklocks|E], shattering their mountain home, Ulkhásh was slain before his victory could be fully realized. \n\nThose mountains blessed by Ulkhásh are now wild and unpredictable, as likely to strike down Ulkhásh's children as their rightful enemy. Ulkháshuli make regular sacrifices to these peaks, either to temporarily appease the flames, or to hasten their eruption, while the more devout inhale volcanic fumes in the hopes of gaining prophetic insight. Ulkháshuli believe that, with enough sacrifices, every mountain will one day erupt in fire, destroying the Dwarves, and forever dimming the cursed sun in the sky."

 orc_spider_cult: "Cult of Enânagosnî" #MERP prodigy of Ungoliant. Legend blended with Ungoliant's
 orc_spider_cult_adj: "Enânagosnî"
 orc_spider_cult_adherent: "Enânagosnî Cultist"
 orc_spider_cult_adherent_plural: "Enânagosnî Cultists"
 orc_spider_cult_desc: "In the darkest places of the [yellowmountains|E], food is often scarcer than light. The [orcs|E] here speak of Enânagosnî, an ancient spider-god of terrible malice. It is said that Enânagosnî carved the first tunnels beneath the mountain, and drank the light that filled them. She birthed the first shadows and so gave the Orcs a home. Though food was scarce, she taught the first Cultists to weave webs and make traps. For all of her gifts, however, the spider-god is fickle. She ate many Orcs, all that she could catch, and, growing ever more famished, turned beyond the tunnels to feast on the world outside. Though the Cultists of Enânagosnî fear her eventual return, they revere her teachings nonetheless."
 
 faith_marketcher: "Rites of the Dâyanûshu"
 faith_marketcher_adj: "Dâyanûshu"
 faith_marketcher_adherent: "Ritualist"
 faith_marketcher_adherent_plural: "Ritualists"
 faith_marketcher_desc: "Ever since the first [goblins|E] crept into the eastern [yellowmountains|E], long eons ago, they have known one truth: that the world outside is a prison. The wide open, beneath the burning sun and accursed stars is the realm of the terrifying Dâyanûshu- malevolent spirits bent on dominating the will of the living.\n\nConstant rituals are needed to keep the Dâyanûshu at bay. Especially sharp stalagmites are chosen, and etched with protective runes. Sacrifices are then placed atop these spines, their blood draining through each carefully carved line. The most elaborate of these rituals can involve sprawling blood-mosaics, their patterns as intricate as they are gruesome." 
 
 faith_murghuri: "Command of the Murghúri"
 faith_murghuri_adj: "Murghúrhuli"
 faith_murghuri_adherent: "Murghúrhul"
 faith_murghuri_adherent_plural: "Murghúrhuli"
 faith_murghuri_desc: "Among the [orcs|E] of the Yellow Mountains, tales are told in hushed whispers of the Murghúri, a demon of ancient power. Here and there it wanders, cloaked in darkest night, gathering servants to follow its black command. Those that deny the Murghúri are doomed to servitude and death, while those that join its host are lavished in plunder and granted mystical boons.\n\nMurghúrhuli is a unique case of accidental syncretism, "Murghúri" worship being, in truth, a fusion of two separate Sauronic cults, dedicated to the [ringwraith|E]s [khorahil|E] and $Ji_Indur$ respectively. While hybridization of the two into a single faith was by no means intentional, their merging ultimately benefitted Sauronic interests in the region, allowing either Nazgûl to take advantage of gains made by the other." 
 
 faith_peltripper: "Praukîb-kai"
 faith_peltripper_adj: "Praukîbzûr"
 faith_peltripper_adherent: "Praukîbzu"
 faith_peltripper_adherent_plural: "Praukîbzûr"
 faith_peltripper_desc: "Tales of demons and spirits have long proliferated among the superstitious [orcs|E] and [goblins|E] of the Utter South. While the exact qualities of these beings vary from tribe to tribe and telling to telling, they are near universally regarded as malicious entities, appeased only by acts of incredible violence or generous tribute.\n\nMost cults agree that the greatest tribute one can give is to die gloriously in battle, a belief that has fostered a unique attitude among believers. Adherents strive to earn a legendary death, or barring that, accrue enough plunder to satiate the ravenous appetites of their fickle gods."
