 faith_numenorean_desc:0 "Tutored by the [eldar|E] and the [maiargods|E], the [numenorean|E]s adopted their religious customs as their own. Just as [manwecharactershort|E] upon Taniquentil, the King of the [numenorean|E]s would thrice a year ascend the holy mountain, the [meneltarma|E], at times of sowing, midsummer, and harvest, offering the fruits of the earth to the Allfather. These were the Neldë Kyermi (the Three Prayers), the Erukyermë, Erulaitalë, and Eruhantalë. In addition to their reverence of [erutheone|El], the [numenorean|E]s also revered the [valargods|E] as his appointed stewards and regents of Eä. \n\nOne unique aspect of the [numenorean|E] faith compared with the [highelves|E] and Valar is the 'Old Hope of Men', the Estel Enwina, a legend preserved since before the Edain entered [beleriand|E]. According to the lore their ancestors had passed down to them, the Hope was that one day the Allfather would enter creation incarnated as one of the Eruhín and mend the marring from beginning to end. \n\n#TOLKIENQUOTE "Ilúvatar is the Lord for Always who dwells beyond the world, who made it and is not of it nor in it, but loves it." \n\n#QUOTEDCHARACTER - Rúmil of Tirion, The Book of Lost Tales Part One, "The Music of the Ainur""

 dunedain_religion_desc:0 "Also known as the [faithful|E], the Elendili are those of the Edain, [numenorean|E]s, and [dunedain|E] who accepted, embraced, and retained the teachings of the [highelves|E] concerning the divine truth of the universe."

 faith_edain_desc:0 "[Glossary('Et Eärello Endorenna utúlien. Sinomë maruvan ar Hildinyar tenn Ambar-metta.', 'oath_of_elendil_gloss' )]\n\nThus did [elendil|E] speak upon his landfall in [middleearth|E] after the [akallabeth|E], and so were the Kingdoms of [gondor|E] and [arnor|E] borne from his nine ships and the colonies of the [faithful|E]. In those realms alone were preserved the ancient rites and worship of [numenor|E] of old, though the Great Prayers are said no longer. The reverence of [eru|E] himself is the centre of the spiritual life of the [dunedain|E], but they do not worship through great temples and ostentatious displays - rather, the [dunedain|E] prioritize private contemplation of the One. \n\nIn daily life, the [valargods|E] are the ones invoked and called upon to intercede on behalf of the [faithful|E], and of them [ulmocharacter|E] is the most cherished." 
 #Old Edain desc: The Edain was the name given by the Elves to the noble Men of the First Age who fought alongside with the Elves in the Wars of Beleriand.\n\nEdain is normally the Sindarin word for Men (sing. adan "Man") and thus applied to all Men, though it became associated with only those who came into Beleriand during the Long Peace, the noble Three Houses who became close allies with the Elves and fought beside them against Morgoth. Other groups of Men who stayed in Eriador or the East; or entered Beleriand later in the First Age, such as the Easterlings, are not counted among the Edain."

 faith_edain_ulmo_desc:0 "The 'Covenant of Ulmo' refers to the old concord between the [valagod|E] [ulmocharacter|E] and the men of [numenor|E]. As an island nation, and eventual maritime power, [ulmocharacter|E] was amongst the most revered of the [valargods|E] in [numenor|E]. In turn, on account of both their reverence and their long friendship with the [eldar|E], Ulmo came to love the [numenoreans|E] and alone of the Powers spoke to them directly, particularly those belonging to the Guild of Venturers. Also known as the Uinendili, this guild's exploration of the seas and lands was at once worship and adventure in the name of the Sea-King and his [maiargods|E]. \n\nEven though [numenor|E] the Blessed has been long drowned beneath the [greatsea|E], the old covenant is remembered still in the lands of the Exiles. [dunedain|E] mariners in Pelargir, Tharagrondost, [dol_amroth|E], and other great seaports continue to try to keep the ancient traditions of the Guild of Venturers alive."

 faith_edain_manwe_desc:0 "Amongst the [dunedain|E], the [elderkingcharacter|E]'s followers are the most zealous supporters of [elendil|E] and his heirs. For, they judge, only under a truly righteous king can [conceptmankind|E], and indeed all the world, know true stability and prosperity. All the great tragedies of the years past - the [downfallofnumenor|E], the [gondorian|E] [kinstrife|E], the divide and fall of [arnor|E] - they can all be tracked back to leaders weak in moral fibre and their inability to live up to the Elder King's example as a just and wise ruler. \n\nHumanity must replicate the divine order, as decreed by [eruiluvatar|E] himself - did not he make Manwë Sulimo the Viceregent of Eä, and Manwë in turn appointed the line of Elendil to rule the [faithful|E]?"

 faith_edain_varda_desc:0 "It is said that in [gondor|E] there are more speakers of [sindarin|E] and loremasters of [quenya|E] than still live in all the [elven|E] realms east of the [greatsea|E]. In the aftermath of the [akallabeth|E], some members of the [faithful|E] went even farther in their alignment to the Elves, even adopting Elvish religious habits, rejecting any '[mannish|E]' influences which they deemed to have infected that primordial truth. While such zealots are few and far between these days, the Elendili, or 'the Elf-friends', still maintain a more elvish style of faith, obvious in their preference for Sindarin and Quenya, as well as their special veneration of [vardacharacter|E] above all the other [valargods|E]."
