Her domain is honored and upheld with unwavering devotion, prompting the Chaialla to tread lightly upon the earth, lest they disturb the delicate balance of her realm.\n\nIn their secluded hillside caves, the Chaialla gather to offer prayers and offerings to the spirits, seeking harmony and guidance in their existence. Hunting and killing animals are taboo acts, for they understand that such actions would not only disrupt the natural order but also incur the wrath of the Queen of the Earth, whose guardianship they hold in the highest regard."

According to legend, desperate Sîrayni would sometimes carry their sick relatives on a dangerous trek through the woods, in hopes of finding a Rain Speaker. It is even alleged that some Sîrayni kings managed to employ a Speaker as their personal physicians."
