 # The people of Forochel place a pre-eminence on cosmic balance, and all things animate and inanimate have their own tarmo (or spirit), the force which binds a thing to its physical form.\n\nThey believe the physical world is but a smaller part of the greater Spirit World, Henkimaailma, which in turn is encompassed by Ympyrä. They are respectful to the spirits, but do not hold them in a strict heirarchy. Each spirit, of lesser or greater might, has its own place and purpose, just as anything else in the world does.

Chief among these is Aamumeren Isä, an ocean spirit taking the form of a Great Whale. Each year, the coming of the whales into the Bay of Forochel is widely celebrated as they are revered greatly. Whales are believed to be responsible the seasons, the moon cycle and various other phenomena. When balance is threatened because the Lossoth are greedy one year, fewer whales will visit the next and famine will follow. Thus balance must always be maintained."

Coming to believe they had been swept ever westwards by a symbolic wave they were reverent of nature and water in particular, while retaining a very strong sense of loyalty and justice.
