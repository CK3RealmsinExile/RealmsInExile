 # The people of Forochel place a pre-eminence on cosmic balance, and all things animate and inanimate have their own tarmo (or spirit), the force which binds a thing to its physical form.\n\nThey believe the physical world is but a smaller part of the greater Spirit World, Henkimaailma, which in turn is encompassed by Ympyrä. They are respectful to the spirits, but do not hold them in a strict hierarchy. Each spirit, of lesser or greater might, has its own place and purpose, just as anything else in the world does.

 #faith_lossoth_desc: "The ancient set of beliefs which dominate the shores of the broader bay of Forochel, Tasapaino Ympyrä can be roughly translated to 'Perfect Balance in the World', the central notion being that the world has a natural balance, which all should strive to maintain. \n\nEverything has its place within Ympyrä - almost all, anyway. Some things, such as [orcs|E], [trolls|E], [dragons|E] and other unnatural creatures are held to be Ulkopuolesta, 'from outside'. Such creatures are held to originate from outside the natural order, and as such, should be excised from it wherever possible."

 faith_whale_cult_desc: "The [Glossary('Tespra Mereijä','tespra_mereija_gloss')] are a subsect of the wider [lossoth|E] faith. While they share most of the broader faith’s tenets, the Mereijät place special emphasis on the sea and its guardians—the whales—as keepers of the world’s balance. Chief among these is Aamumeren Isä, an ocean spirit in the form of a Great Whale.\n\nEach year, the whales’ return to the Bay of [forochel|E] is widely celebrated, for they are held in the highest reverence. Whales are believed to govern the seasons, the lunar cycle, and various other natural phenomena. If the Lossoth grow greedy one year, balance is upset: fewer whales visit the next, and famine follows. Thus, harmony must always be preserved."

Of these, some came to admire the ways of the [elves|E] whom they were allied to, believing that their purpose in reaching the westernmost shores of [middleearth] was to aid the Elves in their endeavors and wars against the Darkness. Convinced they had been swept ever westward by a symbolic wave, they held nature—and water in particular—in reverence, while retaining a very strong sense of loyalty and justice.\n\nChief among them were Bór and his sons, who refused [sauronthedarklordcharacter|E]’s offer to betray the [noldor|E] at the Battle of Tears Unnumbered."
