From the nearby [shire|E], they have adopted traditions like the love for the seasonal festivals, the exchange of small carved gifts, and the singing of heartfelt, celebratory verses.\n\nTogether, these shared practices underscore a deep respect for nature’s cycles and reinforce the bonds between Hobbits and men alike.

Never dogmatic, these practices are highly practical in their application, cultivated over many generations of travel through dangerous territory.\n\nWhile largely abandoned following the settlement of the [shire|E], especially bold Hobbits were known to embrace the Wandering Ways, in search of adventure in far distant lands."
