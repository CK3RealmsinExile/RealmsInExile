 faith_brigaicism_desc:0 "Breeish religion maintained a notably informal character, steeped in traditions that harkened back to the ancient customs of the [dunedain|E]. A few old rituals and various toasts and blessings persisted in modified forms. While [erutheone|E] was held in reverence as the divine, mentions of him were rare and direct invocation was avoided out of profound respect. The [valargods|E] were often perceived as a collective entity referred to as the [powersgods|E] of the [west|E], playing a minor role in their practices. The Bree-men shared many festivities with the [hobbit|E] neighbours, each celebrated with communal gatherings and rituals that reflected the cyclical rhythms of nature."
