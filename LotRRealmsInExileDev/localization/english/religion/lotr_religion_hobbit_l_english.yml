They have many legends of trolls, trickersters, nature spirits and faeries, and are a superstitious folk, but their musings rarely touches on greater questions of creation, authority, or purpose. To the Hobbits, the world simple is, and they must live with it - so best to stay where it is safe!\n\nThe more learned of their number, if they speak of a higher power, probably speak of Yavanna, the Queen of the Earth. It is she that assures the bounteous harvests, and the wealth of the field, who allows the Hobbits their peaceful existence."
