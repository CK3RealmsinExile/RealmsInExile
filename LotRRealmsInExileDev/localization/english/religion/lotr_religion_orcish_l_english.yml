 ### Orcish Religion ###
 #######################
 
 orcish_religion: "Orc"
 orcish_religion_adj: "Orcish"
 orcish_religion_desc: "The Orcs outside the influence of the Dark Lords run a wide gambit of beliefs, but are usually dominated by common strands of strength and ruthless brutality."
 orcish_religion_adherent: "Orc"
 orcish_religion_adherent_plural: "Orcs"

 way_of_strength: "Pardahûnúk" #Black Speech for 'arising in might'
 way_of_strength_adj: "Pardahûnúk"
 way_of_strength_adherent: "Orc"
 way_of_strength_adherent_plural: "Orcs"
 way_of_strength_desc: "Rejecting service to the [darklord|E], the Pardahûnúk refers to the [orcs|E] who instead harbor desires to take that place themselves. Not really a religion, it is much more a very crude philosophy, born as much of spite and instinct as any sort of larger worldview. \n\nIn short, it is this - the weak shall serve the strong. There are no depths to which one cannot sink in the name of seizing power, of becoming one’s own lord and master. In time even the strongest stumble and their foes slay them; then a new orc shall take his place at the top of the peak, and the cycle begins anew. This is an eternal cycle, one which the Orcs shall perpetrate unto the ending of the world."

 cult_of_the_ulukai: "Cult of the Ulûkai" 
 cult_of_the_ulukai_adj: "Ulûkai"
 cult_of_the_ulukai_adherent: "Ulûkai Cultist"
 cult_of_the_ulukai_adherent_plural: "Ulûkai Cultists"
 cult_of_the_ulukai_desc: "When [gundabad|E] fell to the hosts of the [orcs|E], its leader bore the Ulûkai, a great black jewel, one of the greatest treasures of the treasury of [angband|E]. The jewel exuded an aura which echoed the throne room of Angband, and indeed the Dark Lord [morgothcharacter|E] himself, emitting a perverse light corrupted by the long years of his dominion. By right of bearing the jewel, Skorg, first lord of Gundabad, claimed the title of Ashdurbúk (Sole Ruler) of the North. For the Jewel called darkness to darkness, and strength to strength, and Skorg grew fell and strong by its grace, though ever more cruel, and the orcs feared and revered him. To hold the Ulûkai is to be embraced by the Dark, to bear the blessing and curse of its Lord. When Skorg was entombed in the deepest depths of Gundabad, he took with him the Ulûkai, and those who seek to claim the mantle of Ashdurbúk must brave the darkened depths alone to bring it to the sun's light once more.\n\nThe Ulûkai and tomb of Skorg were later lost. With them, the cult of the Ulûkai and Skorg the first Ashdurbúk faded into history."

 faith_balrog_cult: "Cult of the Dark Flame"
 faith_balrog_cult_adj: "Ghâshûli"
 faith_balrog_cult_adherent: "Ghâshûl"
 faith_balrog_cult_adherent_plural: "Ghâshûli"
 faith_balrog_cult_desc: "In the depths of [moria|E], many of the local [goblins|E] have taken to a crude form of fire worship, likely inspired by Durin's Bane, the [balrog|E] that sometimes roams their ruined halls. The primitive rituals of the Ghâshûli ('Servants of the Flame') vary greatly between tribes but the basic philosophy is the same - [orcs|E] are naturally drawn to serving the strongest being, and the Dark Flame, the all-consuming force of fire, is clearly the strongest being of all. Perhaps worship of it could appease the Flame-that-Walks, avoid its wrath or even gain its favor.\n\nDurin's Bane itself seems to be mostly oblivious to its worship by the locals and acts more like a force of nature than a deity."
 
 faith_deep_cult: "Cults of the Deep"
 faith_deep_cult_adj: "Deep Cults"
 faith_deep_cult_adherent: "Deep Cultist"
 faith_deep_cult_adherent_plural: "Deep Cultists"
 faith_deep_cult_desc: "In the darkest depths far beneath the world, some [goblins|E] have taken to worshipping the shadows themselves and those that lurk within them. They are the inaudible whispers that haunt you in the dark, they are the faint breeze that raises the hair on your neck and they are the things in the corner of your eye. Close to the surface their influence can barely be perceived, but the deeper you go, the stronger it will be. Their domain is the impenetrable darkness at the bottom of the world, where their power is greatest.\n\nWorshippers of the Deep often shun the light, as it obstructs the other senses. They revel in their own paranoia, cultivated through a life spent in eternal darkness."
 
 faith_goblin_town: "Cult of the Great Fat One"
 faith_goblin_town_adj: "Great Fat One"
 faith_goblin_town_adherent: "Fat Cultist"
 faith_goblin_town_adherent_plural: "Fat Cultists"
 faith_goblin_town_desc: "Among the diminutive and hunched [goblins|E] of the Misty Mountains, there is a reverence of the strong and the well-fed. In particular, they have a reverence towards the mythical 'Great Fat One', the exemplar of their race. Of immense girth and size, his strength is greater than [trolls|E], his larder richer than a [dwarf|E]-king. All Goblins admire him and desire to be him. To serve him is to know plenty, and to oppose him to know famine."
 
 dragon_cult: "Dragon Cults"
 dragon_cult_adj: "Dragon Cults"
 dragon_cult_adherent: "Dragon Cultist"
 dragon_cult_adherent_plural: "Dragon Cultists"
 dragon_cult_desc: "In the remote corners of the [greymountains|E], [orcs|E] over time came to worship the [dragons|E] that dwelled there out of fear and reverence for their strength. The beliefs held by these individual cults vary greatly due to their isolation, but some most have in common: Dragons are tyrants made of flesh and flame, destined to rule the world, and they will burn all who oppose them. The popularity of these cults waxed and waned greatly overtime, but with the decline and eventual extinction of the last Great Dragons in the late [thirdage|E], they have begun to loose popularity."
