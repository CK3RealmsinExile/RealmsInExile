 faith_kings_men_numenorean_desc: "The [kingsmen|E] (Adunaic: Ârûwânai) began as a political faction within the [numenorean|E] Court, but in time evolved past that. The [numenoreans|E], desiring  eternal life in their bliss, began to resent the [banofthevalar|E]. So too did they begin to resent the [eldar|E], whose eternal life they judged should be theirs as well by right of their forefather Azrubêl, Eärendil the Morningstar. They came to judge the [avaloigods|E] as withholding from them the choice of their Doom by malice, not lack of ability. In time this became a deepset belief that it was [conceptmankind|E], not the [ainurgods|E] or the [elves|E], that were the true heirs of the world, and that their time had now come. And amongst Men, the [numenoreans|E] were the purest, most worthy, and so they descended into hedonism and tyranny.\n\nTowards [erutheone|El], the views of the Ârûwânai differed greatly. Many maintained after some fashion their old reverence, holding him the only true God of Mankind, compared with the [elven|E]-aligned Valar. Yet just as many came to doubt or resent him, as he seemed silent and unwilling to aid or amend his creation.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the [downfallofnumenor|E], the Ârûwânai maintained that they remained loyal to the true king, Ar-Pharazon. Thus, they claimed no kingships, but made oligarchies for themselves that would rule until the rightful king would return. However, as the [thirdage|E] progressed and the lack of any return became apparent, the ideology of the Ârûwânai came to be accepting of any 'legitimate' [adunai|E] monarch."

 faith_pharazon_desc: "The Agannâlumâbâ Âru (Adunaic: The King without the Shadow of Death) refers to the cult worship of Ar-Pharazôn the Golden as an immortal god-king.\n\nThis faith holds that Ar-Pharazôn triumphed in his war against the Valar. However, in the process, the Undying Lands and Númenor (now too a hallowed, eternal land) were removed from the world, and the way lost to those left behind. Pharazôn took up his throne as the new Great God, Arminalêth remade from ruin as a glorious temple city and throne. From the new Eternal [anadune|e], the Agannâlumâbâ Âru watches over all his people left behind, and yearns to guide them to glory and eternal life in his new kingdom.\n\nTo achieve this end, lesser men must be offered up in his name. Blood shall flow in the temples, sustaining this broken world by the grace of the Agannâlumâbâ Âru - until that glorious day when the worthy shall ascend into his eternal kingdom."

 faith_kings_men_castamir_desc:0 "The revival of the ideology of the [kingsmen|E] was a most strange occurence in the late [thirdage|E], largely championed by the followers of Castamir the Usurper. In this schema, the religious authority and gravity of the monarch was even more enhanced than that of the priest-kings of the [dunedain|E], becoming viewed as a conduit of the divine itself, able to make judgements and decrees in the place of the divine. To challenge the rightful king was heresy, and to aid him was righteousness. Additionally, in time the faith came to absorb many [haradrim|E] cults, rituals, and traditions, allowing the King to be the stand in to many different dieties and build a potent coalition from them.\n\nThis simple ideology was potent in its great flexibility, as the King's position as divine conduit and interpreter, not just petitioner, allowed for swift and easy shifting of theology to suit the issues of the day."

 #largely extinct after the end of the first millenia of the Third Age, but saw a revival under the Castamiri, who sought to legitimize their reign and institute an ideology of royal  authority above all others."
 # Old second paragraph: \n\nEven to the end, when the worship of [melkorcharacter|E] and loyalty to the King became so deeply intertwined, there was still those that refused to acknowledge [morgothcharacter|E], holding him as merely another of the [ainurgods|E] seeking to dominate humanity. After the [akallabeth|E], these two hesitantly united factions violently clashed in the southern Númenórean colonies, each blaming the other for the Downfall.
 #Original Kings Men DESC: The King's Men were originally Númenóreans that shunned the ways of the Valar and actively went against their will in the search for immortality. Following the wrath of Eru and the sinking of Númenor, the survivors of the calamity continued to seek refuge in the worship of Melkor. Hatred and turmoil found root in the hearts of those "Black Númenóreans", who spread their doctrines of corruption and malice amongst the natives of southern Middle-earth.

 faith_anballukhor_desc:0 "In the aftermath of the [downfallofnumenor|E], many previous beliefs were shaken. From the chaos and turmoil of the early centuries of the [thirdage|E] arose a new doctrine in [anbalkumagan|E], known as the Batân an-Aphan, or 'Path of Bliss'.\n\nAcknowledging the transient nature of life and the need to make the most of it, Aphanists seek ever greater joys and pleasure above all others - which they hold the supreme good found in this life, its moral worth self-evident. Those that seek ascetism in pursuit of righteousness harm themselves without need.\n\nIn the Aphanist view of the world, some are predestined for prosperity, and these are the [adunai|E]. Granted greater years within the world, their days to savor prolonged, they have been given a divine mandate to seek ever-greater joys, more perfect beauties. At whatever price it may cost. As a result, its practioners contain among their ranks some of the greatest hedonists and cruelest, selfish tyrants Men have produced."

Unlike their more rapacious brethren, the followers of the Khôrî an-Anûwî hold that this is not unconditional - their dominion is paired with responsibilities, to rule rightly and fairly, if at times sternly, over their 'simpler' kin."

 faith_gimileth_desc:0 "A somewhat rare strain in Adûnaic thought, the school of Nadrôth 'nSapthân-lâi is perhaps the closest of the Kings Men to the Faithful of old. Meaning 'the Wake of the Wise-folk', this school emphasizes a notion of divine continuity and mandate - that Êru has appointed a succession of custodians and masters of the world, to rule and then fade in turn. First were the Avalôi, who helped shape the world and taught the Nimîr. Then in turn, the Nimîr returned to Middle-earth and uplifted the race of Men, with their own pupils becoming the [adunai|E]. Thus, the [adunai|E] received the mandate of rule, and of raising up the next generation, spreading enlightenment and guidance in their wake - hence the name of the school.\n\nSome adherents of this school hold that the Akallabêth was punishment for forgetting this fact in favor of domination, and a reminder - the eras of the Avalôi and Nimîr were not eternal, and neither shall be that of the [adunai|E].\n\nWhile still not immune to notions of cultural paternalism, the Nadrôth 'nSapthân-lâi is perhaps the closest among the [adunai|E] to the original intents of the Numenoreans, coming as teachers and friends to the Men of Middle-earth."

But the veil of ignorance was lifted by the Magician, the Wizard, Zigûrun the Wise, giver of knowledge, giver of gifts! Mightiest of all is he, for he discovered the truth of magic, and how to bend the world to one's own will. None can compare to his might as a result, but through his tutelage even weaker beings may rise to become masters of many."
