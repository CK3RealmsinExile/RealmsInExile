Their faiths run a wide gambit of beliefs and practices, but a common thread is the blessed nature of [numenorean|E] - Adûnaic - heritage."

 faith_kings_men_numenorean_desc: "The [kingsmen|E] (Adunaic: Ârûwânai} began as a political faction within the [numenorean|E] Court, but in time evolved past that. The [numenoreans|E], desiring  eternal life in their bliss, began to resent the [banofthevalar|E]. So too did they begin to resent the [eldar|E], whose eternal life they judged should be theirs as well by right of their forefather Azrubêl, Eärendil the Morningstar. They came to judge the [avaloigods|E] as withholding from them the choice of their Doom by malice, not lack of ability. In time this became a deepset belief that it was [conceptmankind|E], not the [ainurgods|E] or the [elves|E], that were the true heirs of the world, and that their time had now come. And amongst Men, the [numenoreans|E] were the purest, most worthy, and so they descended into hedonism and tyranny.\n\nTowards [erutheone|El], the views of the Ârûwânai differed greatly. Many maintained after some fashion their old reverence, holding him the only true God of Mankind, compared with the [elven|E]-aligned Valar. Yet just as many came to doubt or resent him, as he seemed silent and unwilling to aid or amend his creation.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the [downfallofnumenor|E], the Ârûwânai maintained that they remained loyal to the true king, Ar-Pharazon. Thus, they claimed no kingships, but made oligarchies for themselves that would rule until the rightful king would return. However, as the [thirdage|E] progressed and the lack of any return became apparent, the ideology of the Ârûwânai came to be accepting of any 'legitimate' [adunai|E] monarch."

 faith_kings_men_castamir_desc:0 "The revival of the ideology of the [kingsmen|E] was a most strange occurence in the late [thirdage|E], largely championed by the followers of Castamir the Usurper. In this schema, the religious authority and gravity of the monarch was even more enhanced than that of the priest-kings of the [dunedain|E], becoming viewed as a conduit of the divine itself, able to make judgements and decrees in the place of the divine. To challenge the rightful king was heresy, and to aid him was righteousness. Additionally, in time the faith came to absorb many [haradrim|E] cults, rituals, and traditions, allowing the King to be the stand in to many different dieties and build a potent coalition from them.\n\nThis simple ideology was potent in its great flexibility, as the King's position as divine conduit and interpreter, not just petitioner, allowed for swift and easy shifting of theology to suit the issues of the day."

 #largely extinct after the end of the first millenia of the Third Age, but saw a revival under the Castamiri, who sought to legitimize their reign and institute an ideology of royal  authority above all others."
 # Old second paragraph: \n\nEven to the end, when the worship of [melkorcharacter|E] and loyalty to the King became so deeply intertwined, there was still those that refused to acknowledge [morgothcharacter|E], holding him as merely another of the [ainurgods|E] seeking to dominate humanity. After the [akallabeth|E], these two hesitantly united factions violently clashed in the southern Númenórean colonies, each blaming the other for the Downfall.
 #Original Kings Men DESC: The King's Men were originally Númenóreans that shunned the ways of the Valar and actively went against their will in the search for immortality. Following the wrath of Eru and the sinking of Númenor, the survivors of the calamity continued to seek refuge in the worship of Melkor. Hatred and turmoil found root in the hearts of those "Black Númenóreans", who spread their doctrines of corruption and malice amongst the natives of southern Middle-earth.

 faith_anballukhor_desc:0 "In the aftermath of the [downfallofnumenor|E], many previous beliefs were shaken. From the chaos and turmoil of the early centuries of the [thirdage|E] arose a new doctrine in [anbalkumagan|E], known as the Batân an-Aphan, or 'Path of Bliss'.\n\nEmphasizing the beauty and transient nature of the world, the Anbalûkkhôri embraced the pursuit of beauty, joy, and pleasure above all others - these, they held, are the supreme goods of this world, their moral worth self-evident. Those that seek ascetism in pursuit of righteousness harm themselves without need. All our fates are determined ere we are born, so why deny what providence grants us?\n\nIn the Aphanist view of the world, some are predestined for prosperity, and these are the [adunai|E]. Granted greater years within the world, their days to savor prolonged, they have been given a divine mandate to seek ever-greater joys, more perfect beauties. However, the Aphanists do acknowledge those not of the Adûnai may attempt to walk the path, and if so, bid them luck in their search for bliss in this world."

 faith_thani_hazad_desc:0 "The Khôrî an-Anûwî, or 'Lords of Men', refers to the dominant religious-political philosophy practiced by the [adunai|E] of the former Princedom of [zimrathani|E].\n\nAt its core, it holds that the [adunai|E], as the most advanced, sophisticated, and blessed of all [conceptmankind|E] have a divine mandate to rule and order the world for the prosperity of all. Unlike their more rapacious brethren, the followers of the Khôrî an-Anûwî hold that this is not unconditional - their dominion is paired with responsibilities, to rule rightly and fairly, if at times sternly, over their 'simpler' kin."
