 faith_angmarrin_desc:0 "In the early second age, the folk of later Angmar had what was termed a prophet rise among them. Descended from a family that had fled the calamity in the West, of which few spoke, this man, Balsha, spoke at great length of the gods and their deeds. While they had always believed in great spirits, it was Balsha's teachings and stories which gave the Angmarrin pantheon its coherent form."
