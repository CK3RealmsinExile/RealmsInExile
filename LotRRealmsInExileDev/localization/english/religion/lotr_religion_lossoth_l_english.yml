 lossoth_religion_desc:0 "The people of Forochel place a pre-eminence on cosmic balance, and all things animate and inanimate have their own tarmo (or spirit), the force which binds a thing to its physical form.\n\nThey believe the physical world is but a smaller part of the greater Spirit World, Henkimaailma, which in turn is encompassed by Ympyrä. They are respectful to the spirits, but do not hold them in a strict heirarchy. Each spirit, of lesser or greater might, has its own place and purpose, just as anything else in the world does."

 faith_lossoth_desc:0 "The ancient set of beliefs which dominate the shores of the broader bay of Forochel, Tasapaino Ympyrä can be roughly translated to 'Perfect Balance in the World', the central notion being that the world has a natural balance, which all should strive to maintain. \n\nEverything has its place within Ympyrä - almost all, anyway. Some things, such as orcs, trolls, dragons and other unnatural creatures are held to be Ulkopuolesta, 'from outside'. Such creatures are held to originate from outside the natural order, and as such, should be excised from it wherever possible."
