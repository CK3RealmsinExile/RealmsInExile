 kings_men_desc:0 "The [kingsmen|E] began as a political faction within the [numenorean|E] Court, but they have long since evolved past that. The [numenoreans|E], desiring eternal life in their bliss, began to resent the [banofthevalar|E]. So too did they begin to resent the Eldar, whose eternal life they judged should be theirs as well by right of their forefather Azrubêl, Eärendil the Morningstar. They came to judge the [valargods|E] as withholding from them the choice of their Doom by malice, not lack of ability. In time this became a deepset belief that it was Mankind, not the [ainurgods|E] or the [quendi|E], that were the true heirs of the world, and that their time had now come. And amongst Men, the [numenoreans|E] were the purest, most worthy, and so they descended into hedonism and tyranny. \n\nEven to the end, when the worship of [melkorcharacter|E] and loyalty to the King became so deeply intertwined, there was still those that refused to acknowledge [morgothcharacter|E], holding him as merely another of the [ainurgods|E] seeking to dominate humanity. After the [akallabeth|E], these two hesitantly united factions violently clashed in the southern Númenórean colonies, each blaming the other for the Downfall."
 #Original Kings Men DESC: The King's Men were originally Númenóreans that shunned the ways of the Valar and actively went against their will in the search for immortality. Following the wrath of Eru and the sinking of Númenor, the survivors of the calamity continued to seek refuge in the worship of Melkor. Hatred and turmoil found root in the hearts of those "Black Númenóreans", who spread their doctrines of corruption and malice amongst the natives of southern Middle-earth.

Its fundamental beliefs are rooted in the text of the same name, which has been preserved since the early second age. The writings detail the vast multitudes of gods and spirits that exist within everything, but it also takes an extremely negative view of death and the afterlife. It describes the afterlife as a grey and dull place, where there is no suffering but also no joy, just a silence and your own thoughts until you wish for the release of the void. \n\nThe death-god Tûlimi is thus highly feared in the faith, and there is a ferocious drive to survive and to achieve as much as possible while alive. Vâtra has risen in prominence as the years have gone on, a belief forming that the sun god could perhaps hold the secrets to life unending, a way to avoid the gloomy halls."

She is grieved by strife amongst both the Gods and Men, and desires nothing more than to return to the days of old when the world was peaceable and plenty - but the ambitions of Vâtra cannot be quenched, and so instead she focuses on teaching men the importance of love and pity for one another.

She is the mother goddess of humanity, and with her father shares the duties of maintaining cosmic balance and temporal justice. She is the wife of Vâtra, but they are long estranged - for Vâtra in his burning ambition and lust for dominion slew Nâdi-manyê and sought to bring all the Heavens under his authority. But Ladnôca rallied the pantheon against him, and in a calamitous battle the home of the Gods upon earth was annihilated, with them becoming spirits who burn still in the sky. Since then, the two have danced in the sky, neither achieving victory over the other. Vâtra's fury scorches Harad barren, and only Ladnôca provides relief to the suffering of Mankind through her gift of night and sleep, a reprieve from scorching day. \n\nIt is believed by the scholars of the Dúnedain that Ladnôca is a corrupted amalgamation of Varda, Estë, Áriën, and perhaps a trans-gendered Tilion."

But his acolytes tell a different story. In the Vâtran telling of the great story, the sun-god was instead Nâdi-manyê's appointed successor upon his departure from the world, going Beyond in order to join the Gods who had gone before. This was the natural succession of the Divine Generations. But Ladnôca, bitter to have been passed over by her father for her husband, spread dissent among the pantheon and incited revolt against the rightful king. \n\nThe story ends much the same as the traditional Haradrim telling - the rebellion is a success, but to the Vâtrans this is a tragedy, not a triumph. They hold that in time, the Sun-God shall regain his rightful place and humble the pantheon and his wife. Then shall true divine order at last be restored and peace reign across all the lands. The sun and the moon shall contest no more, and the sorrows of Men ended. \n\nThe Aûdrat Vâtra has long since been subverted by Sauron for his own ends."

In the dawn of time, the world was ruled by the Gods from their lofty halls, atop the highest mountain of creation. In those days all the world was lush and verdant, when Nâdi-manyê reigned upon the mountainside. But in time Vâtra brought war to the palaces of Heaven, and the mountain was leveled ere he slew Nâdi-manyê. The physical bodies of the Gods failed in the great battle, and they became as spirits, and then Ladnôca rallied all the Gods. Even those who had previously harkened to Vâtra aligned with her and overthrew Vâtra. \n\nIn rage and fury, unable to harm each other on account of their vows of marriage, Vâtra instead turned his fury on the land which had been Ladnôca's dowry. Where once immense forests and lush lands had been, now only a desert waste endured. Ladnôca could save but a small portion of the world from his fury. Her tears water the lands of Rây, and in this land the remnants of Mankind were brought together. From their number came Iunást, who did what Ladnôca could not, and banished Vâtra. He freed Mankind from Vâtra's tyranny, though the lands scorched bare would never forget the god's fury. He then was adopted as Ladnôca's son and took his place amongst the gods."

 faith_pust_desc:0 "The tribes surrounding the Mirror of Fire eke out their existence in the Great Desert and skirt the edges of that desolate plain. Their faith, composed of oral folklore passed down by the generations, varies somewhat from tribe to tribe, but they all share one story. This great myth-cycle concerns Fuinur Stormheart, a lord of ancient Númenor who braved the Mirror of Fire in search of the Living Waters, said to be housed deep beneath a mountain which rose at its heart. At last, he came to the mountain and there built a great well - and was never heard from again. Some claim he died, and others claim he descended his well to the fount of the Living Waters, and reigns eternal there, a king beneath the mountain. This story cannot truly be verified - none amongst the Sandmen tribes are so foolish as to push that deep into the Mirror of Fire. But the story remains, an idea that beneath the sun-baked earth, there is life-giving water running in a great stream from ages primordial."

While Béma roams afar, his wife Foldewyn, mighty in her own right, reigns over the fey in her court of starlight. \n\nDwelling in the forest of the mist, the Leofring believe that Foldewyn bears a fickle mood, proud, and slow to forgive the mistakes of mankind. Her favour is perilous to acquire, though rich when gotten; for few come again from her forest, and not unchanged.

The restless fey have turned fell and taken up twisted forms. Bony hands stretch forth to grasp the living and take our life for their own. Only through grand sacrifices can they be appeased, lest the malice of their dread king fall upon us, and our ruin come."

 nurniag_desc:0 "Encircling the Sea of Núrn on three sides, the Núrniags form an upper caste within Mordor. They gorge on the conquests of Sauron, which provides them the slaves needed to work their vast plantation. If the Dark Lord is not waging war, it is not uncommon to find young and adventurous Núrniag aristocrats leading slaving parties, aiming to secure wealth and fame for themselves. \n\nReligiously, the Núrniag are one of the most religiously orthodox groups of Sauron's empire, worshipping him through a local variant of the Cult of the Lidless Eye. They revere him as both King and God, and credit him with the fertility of Núrn's black soil. They offer him lavish tribute from their vast plantations, extracted from the bloodied corpses of their legions of slaves."
