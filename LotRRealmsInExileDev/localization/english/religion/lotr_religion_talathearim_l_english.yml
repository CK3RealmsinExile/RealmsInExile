The war god is harsh but fair in his dealings; all who live and die by the sword are in his hands and authority. It is said that worthy warriors are called to his halls, set apart from the other gods, where they might train, feast, and gird themselves for the day when the Final Battle comes. On that day, the right to rule shall be proven to derive foremost from strength. \n\nAnother indigenous faith that [sauroncharacter|E] has manipulated to his own use, the cult of Maladûm is most commonly found among the Tedjin and the Balcoth."

 faith_easterling_shadow_desc:0 "Kôr-Sharhaigûn is the ancient god of darkness, death, and fate among the Easterlings. He is, of all the gods, the most dangerous - bemused by the bickering of his kin for the celestial throne, as he alone of them all knows the truth. In time, they all shall come before him, and pass into his darkness, the world returning to the void from which is came. \n\nUntil then, he alternates delightfully between moods, fickle in his fey tempers. Sometimes he is wise and kindly, offering advice and wisdom to the worthy, foretelling what is to come. Othertimes he is cruel and vain; this world, ephemeral and passing, is a plaything to him, and the suffering of mankind creates the sweetest odes."

 faith_kerkassk_desc:0 "The Plain-God of [rhun|E], Kerkassk is the guardian of the dead, the defender agaisnt all malignant spirits, and surpreme diety of the Easterlings of Rhûn. To the Easterlings of Rhûn, the physical and spiritual worlds are tightly bound together, with the actions in one affecting the other. Kerkassk's followers hold that he vigiliantly wages warfare for their sakes in the spirit-world, trying to prevent the dominion of the ambitious Powers of the West and their followers. However, to achieve this victory in the spiritual world, the sons of Rhûn must stand united in the wars of the physical world, with valour and a willingness to place their faith in Kerkassk's strength and vision. This vision is made manifest through his priests and his own occasional descents into the physical world.\n\nThough they were slain long ago, Kerkassk is aided by the [dragons|E] who so fiercly fought the West, even in death unwilling to bow their heads. Because of this, dragons are upheld as symbols of defiance and power, unbending and unyielding to any and all.\n\nOriginating in the Rhûnnic steppe in the 1400s, the faith of Kerkassk arose from the deep feelings of resentment and weakness by the Igath and Ioriags of Rhûn after the decisive campaigns of Romendacil II."

 faith_rhun_pantheistic_desc:0 "The ancient faith of [rhun|E] is rooted in a wide pantheon of gods and spirits absorbed from the waves of people whom have migrated into the region. Because of this, regional beliefs often vary, with some spirits prioritized over others in particular locations. \n\nAt the faith's core is a central divine pantheon, with two primary progenitor gods: Kôr-Sharhaigûn, god of the Darkness, and Hûr-Iriga, god of the Light. They are co-existential, coming into existence at once. But Kôr-Sharhaigûn desired stillness and eternal sleep, whereas Hûr-Iriga desired to fill the cosmos with song and light, emotion and change. Their visions clashed within the primordial void, and from their clash came the other gods and indeed the world itself, wrought from their comingled might. The two fell into a deep slumber, their strength all but spent until the Last Day, when all living things shall have to choose whose vision to follow - if a third path might not be found...\n\nIn their absence, the world was left to their children, of whom both Gods, Spirits, and Mortals are accounted. In all things now are light and shadow intermingled, though in greater or lesser measure, and none can exist without the other piece. Those who deny this deny themselves."

 faith_phaon_afod_desc:0 "Not all interactions between Easterling and [northmen|E] have resulted in bloodshed and hate. Trade, co-existence, and even love has proven possible. When such occurs, a meeting of minds and faiths is almost inevitable. In particular, the Easterlings came to view the old [northmen|E] god Afodfréa as being the same as their own god Phaon, God of the Sun, Summer, and Fatherhood. Phaon and Afodfréa both embodied the warrior and the positive masculine energy - the strength to protect, to guide, and to lead. The cult of Phaon-Afod became a means of uniting the two communities, drawing rites and traditions from each.\n\nUnfortunately, as the influence of [sauroncharacter|E] grew strong once more, the Easterlings and Northmen once more became bitter foes, and with it, the cult of Phaon-Afod faded from memory."

Oh, there might exist other spirits, of greater or lesser might, but they are not true gods, not worthy of sacrifice and honor, of praise and worship - not as Tûmrakhi is. \n\nAnd Tûmrakhi has chosen the men of Khand as his chosen people, so the Variags hold, who have been promised his divine blessing and guidance. They will spread His name to the utter ends of the earth. \n\nLong subverted by Sauron, the ancient pantheon of Khand has been all but wiped from history. In its place, Sauron-Tûmrakhi reigns surpreme over the spiritual lives of the belligerent Variags. Those who have managed to unify the Variag clans in the past have been judged as Khûdriag-Ata, God-Kings, chosen, exalted, and blessed with a spark of Tûmrakhi himself."

If the Dark Lord is not waging war, it is not uncommon to find young and adventurous Núrniag aristocrats leading slaving parties, aiming to secure wealth and fame for themselves. \n\nReligiously, the Núrniag are one of the most religiously orthodox groups of Sauron's empire, worshipping him through a local variant of the Cult of the Lidless Eye. They revere him as both King and God, and credit him with the fertility of Núrn's black soil. They offer him lavish tribute from their vast plantations, extracted from the bloodied corpses of their legions of slaves."

For their lack of faith, for their rebellion and strife against Him, they are forced to labor eternally for his glory. Only this stays his hand, and permits their existence in his world."
