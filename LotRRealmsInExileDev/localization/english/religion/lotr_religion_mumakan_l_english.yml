 faith_amav_adherent_plural:0 "Amâvians"
 faith_amav_desc:0 "The traditional belief of Mûmakan, Amâvianism reveres the patriarch of the south, the God-king Amâv. He was the first leader and king of the people who would later become the Mûmakani, and his kingship is said to have ruled over the entirety of the south in a golden age from his capital in the holy city of Amarû. He laid down the foundational laws and customs which have bound the region for countless generations since. Indeed, it is held by many of the faithful that he was the incarnate form of Mûmathûmûr, the High-King of the Gods, come to guide [men|E] and grant them a fraction of the blood of the Gods. Even for those who do not hold this, Amâv remains the patron and god of humanity, their divine protector and advocate.\n\nAmâv is said to have had 100 children from his many wives, and appointed each son and daughter their own tribe among his people to rule and lead, prophesizing that one day, one of them would bring forth an heir who would build upon all he had built. After this, he is said to have vanished into the heavens in a great bolt of light, all that was left behind being his crown, which only his prophesized heirs could wear without great pain. The apportion of Amâv's realm is the root for the varying political customs of the clans and tribes of Mûmakan - some daughters established matriarches, sons patriarchies, some traditions of lordship by acclaim and election.\n\nThe old Amâvians, in contrast with the followers of the codes of Ji-Indûr, hold that Amâv's true heir has not yet come, and await the day of their coming."

 faith_indur_adj:0 "Indûrist"
 faith_indur_adherent:0 "Indûrist"
 faith_indur_adherent_plural:0 "Indûrists"
 faith_indur_desc:0 "Indûrism takes its name from Ji-Indûr, the second God-king of Mûmakan, who claimed (and many people believed) was the second coming of the God-king Amâv. Indûr, as Amâv before him, unified the people under a vigorous and powerful king. But where Amâv was legendary for his joy and largess, Indûr was harsh and short, proclaiming himself deeply disappointed by the contention and strife among his people. He reunited Mûmakan for the first time since Amâv, proclaiming that he would lead them towards a new glorious age, united beneath the auspices of conquest and martial code.\n\nHistorically, the claim of Indûr's status as the heir of Amâv has been heavily contested. While Indûr did unify the scattered tribes once more, his aggressive campaigns to expand his people's empire in all directions eventually earned the ire of [numenor|e], and more specifically of Ar-Pharazôn, who crushed the empire at the battle of Kôrlan. Afterwards, Indûr vanished, and many lost heart in his words and creed, despite his long reign, no longer professing him as Amâv come again. However, this belief would see resurgences in the Third Age."

According to their sacred oral traditions, Hudari, guided them out of the oppressive realm of Tantûrak, breaking their shackles of tyranny with the assistance of his loyal servants, the Kinn-lai. Together, they traversed beyond the formidable Yellow Mountains to find sanctuary in the fabled "free western lands".\n\nHudari's character bears resemblance to the [valagod|E] [tulkascharacter|E], and embodies resilience, fortitude, and the indomitable spirit needed to overcome adversity, making him a beacon of hope and inspiration for his devoted followers."
