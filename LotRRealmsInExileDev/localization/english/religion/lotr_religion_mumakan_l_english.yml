 ### Mûmakan ###
 faith_amav: "Codes of Amâv"
 faith_amav_adj: "Amâvian"
 faith_amav_adherent: "Amâvian"
 faith_amav_adherent_plural: "Amâvians"
 faith_amav_desc: "The traditional belief of Mûmakan, Amâvianism reveres the patriarch of the south, the God-king Amâv. He was the first leader and king of the people who would later become the Mûmakani, and his kingship is said to have ruled over the entirety of the south in a golden age from his capital in the holy city of Amarû. He laid down the foundational laws and customs which have bound the region for countless generations since. Indeed, it is held by many of the faithful that he was the incarnate form of Mûmathûmûr, the High-King of the Gods, come to guide [men|E] and grant them a fraction of the blood of the Gods. Even for those who do not hold this, Amâv remains the patron and god of humanity, their divine protector and advocate.\n\nAmâv is said to have had 100 children from his many wives, and appointed each son and daughter their own tribe among his people to rule and lead, prophesizing that one day, one of them would bring forth an heir who would build upon all he had built. After this, he is said to have vanished into the heavens in a great bolt of light, all that was left behind being his crown, which only his prophesized heirs could wear without great pain. The apportion of Amâv's realm is the root for the varying political customs of the clans and tribes of Mûmakan — some daughters established matriarches, sons patriarchies, some traditions of lordship by acclaim and election.\n\nThe old Amâvians, in contrast with the followers of the codes of $Ji_Indur$, hold that Amâv's true heir has not yet come, and await the day of their coming." 

 faith_indur: "Codes of $Ji_Indur$"
 faith_indur_adj: "Indûrist"
 faith_indur_adherent: "Indûrist"
 faith_indur_adherent_plural: "Indûrists"
 faith_indur_desc: "Indûrism takes its name from $Ji_Indur$, the second God-king of Mûmakan, who claimed (and many people believed) was the second coming of the God-king Amâv. Indûr, as Amâv before him, unified the people under a vigorous and powerful king. But where Amâv was legendary for his joy and largess, Indûr was harsh and short, proclaiming himself deeply disappointed by the contention and strife among his people. He reunited Mûmakan for the first time since Amâv, proclaiming that he would lead them towards a new glorious age, united beneath the auspices of conquest and martial code.\n\nHistorically, the claim of Indûr's status as the heir of Amâv has been heavily contested. While Indûr did unify the scattered tribes once more, his aggressive campaigns to expand his people's empire in all directions eventually earned the ire of [numenor|e], and more specifically of Ar-Pharazôn, who crushed the empire at the battle of Kôrlan. Afterwards, Indûr vanished, and many lost heart in his words and creed, despite his long reign, no longer professing him as Amâv come again.\n\n However, these beliefs would see resurgences in the [thirdage|E] as $Ji_Indur$ once again returned to his dominion over the Utter South."

 faith_mumathumur_old_adherent: "Mûmathûmûrist"
 faith_mumathumur_old_adherent_plural: "Mûmathûmûrists"
 faith_mumathumur_desc: "The oldest faith in Mûmakan, Mûmathûmûrism worships the god of the same name, Mûmathûmûr. Revered as 'the Supreme Creator, Lord and Father of Men, and Master of the Earth', he is considered the king of the Gods. It is within his remit to both reward and punish. He is not a soft god, punishing harshly those who rebel or go against his wishes. However, he rewards those who follow him and keep his orders and precepts, granting power, honors, and stature alike. The great Mûmakil are considered his sacred beasts — gentle and very strong until aroused to wrath, at which point none can stand against them and forests are trampled underfoot.\n\nAmong the faithful of Amâv, Mûmathûmûr's harshness is believed to have been tempered by the mercy and patience of Amâv — whether due to his incarnate experience, or because he acts as divine intercessor between humanity and the First King."

 faith_sederi_old_adherent_plural: "Old Ascuru Hudari"
 faith_sederi_desc: "The Cult of Ascuru Hudari reveres the formidable deity known as Hudari, the God of Struggles. According to their sacred oral traditions, Hudari guided them out of the oppressive realm of Tantûrak, breaking their shackles of tyranny with the assistance of his loyal servants, the Kinn-lai. Together, they traversed beyond the formidable [yellowmountains|E] to in search of sanctuary and the fabled 'Free Lands of the West'.\n\n The [adunai|E] in the lands in which they settled saw a resemblance between Hudari and the [valagod|E] [tulkascharactershort|E], because of his personification of resilience, fortitude, and the indomitable spirit needed to overcome adversity. He is a beacon of hope and inspiration for his devoted followers, who look to him in all things."

 faith_hathor_desc: "Hathor the Warrior is the protector and saviour of his people. While great and mighty, he too is kindly and merciful, for he rescued the Hathorim from the depths of the wine-dark sea and sheltered them from Akawa, bearing them out of the deadly waters to his own land. There he sheltered and provided for them, granting the defence of the dense jungle and the guidance of those who first knew the land.

 faith_uvag_old_adherent: "Old Uvâgist"
 faith_uvag_old_adherent_plural: "Old Uvâgists"
 faith_uvag_desc: "Since their advent as a people, the lives of the Drenim were always intertwined Yellow Mountains. The emergence of the Mark-Etcher [goblins|E], whom the Drenim would come to call the Uvâg, from their depths would have a profound impact on their spiritual practices.\n\nUnder the cover of night, the Uvâg would steal Drenim livestock, and occasionally Drenim people, leaving behind mysterious marks carved into stones. A superstitious people, the Drenim would associate the Uvâg with the tortured spirits of those of their ancestors, being condemned to walk the world in corporeal bodies by night. To hold off the attacks, the Drenim built stone structures of their own in their hills, leaving animal sacrifices their as gifts for the damned. When they returned in the morning, the animals would be gone and fresh marks would be seen on the stones. In this way the Drenim acheived a form of symbiosis with the 'Uvâg', who learned to identify their [mannish|E] patrons and would joyously burn down the villages of any outsiders who dared set foot in their lands."
