 faith_arysis: "Cult of Rasayn"
 faith_arysis_adj: "Rasayni"
 faith_arysis_adherent: "Rasaynite"
 faith_arysis_adherent_plural: "Rasaynites"
 faith_arysis_desc: "Traditionally one of the minor gods of the [haradric|E] pantheon, Rasayn has nonetheless found a home in Arysis. Her followers come to the rivers of which she is lady, desiring to be cleansed of their sins and their wrongdoings, repenting their wrongs to each other in the presence of their community. The waters accept and flow over all who come, without regard for their rank or creed.\n\nWater and the rivers are sacred to the followers of Rasayn, the conduits through which divine power flows. They are the founts of life itself, to be guarded and kept pure."

 faith_garauda_old_adj: "Old Graudyni"
 faith_garauda_old_adherent: "Old Graudyn"
 faith_garauda_old_adherent_plural: "Old Graudyni"
 faith_garauda_desc: "Long a source of bafflement for foreign scholars, Graudyn is the lord of goats. In the grand cosmology of the [haradrim|E], he is barely mentioned, yet his cult has remained one of the most enduring in all of Far Harad. In truth, he is an ancient import of Sîrayn, but was adopted with gusto by the Haradrim living in the harsh, rocky lands of the southwest Dune Sea. In Sîrayn the cult has long declined to the point of disappearence, but in Harad it has endured, much like the stalwart goats he is master of, which the Aukuag and Qarsag rely upon for their livelihoods. Yet his traits of simple life, stout resilience, and kind hospitality to strangers has won him great admiration in the harsher lands of Harad."

 faith_ishtra: "Cult of Îshtra"
 faith_ishtra_adj: "Îshtran"
 faith_ishtra_adherent: "Îshtraite"
 faith_ishtra_adherent_plural: "Îshtraites"
 faith_ishtra_desc: "Îshtra, goddess of Love and the incarnate Morning Star is, among the followers of the divine epic of the [haradrim|E], the Kât-Polozây, third-ranked among the gods, after her sister Ladnôca and their father Nâdi-manyê the Windlord.\n\nShe attempts to maintain a careful neutrality in the great battle between her sister Ladnôca and Vâtra, god of the Sun. She is grieved by strife amongst both the Gods and [conceptracemen|E], and desires nothing more than to return to the days of old when the world was peaceable and plenty — but the ambitions of Vâtra cannot be quenched, and so instead she focuses on teaching Men the importance of love and pity for one another.\n\nIf peace amongst the Gods cannot be had, then peace amongst Men shall be good enough."
 
 faith_ladnoca: "Cult of Ladnôca"
 faith_ladnoca_adj: "Ladnôca"
 faith_ladnoca_adherent: "Ladnôcan"
 faith_ladnoca_adherent_plural: "Ladnôcans"
 faith_ladnoca_desc: "Ladnôca, Mother-goddess of [mankind|E], Queen of the Night Sky, and the incarnate Moon is, among the followers of the divine epic of the [haradrim|E], the Kât-Polozây, only below her father Nâdi-manyê, Windlord and king of the Gods. Alongside her father she upholds cosmic balance and maintains temporal justice.\n\nShe is the wife of Vâtra, but they are long estranged — for Vâtra in his burning ambition and lust for dominion slew Nâdi-manyê and sought to bring all the Heavens under his authority. But Ladnôca rallied the pantheon against him, and in a calamitous battle the home of the Gods upon earth was annihilated, with them becoming spirits who burn still in the sky. Since then, the two have danced in the sky, neither achieving victory over the other. Vâtra's fury scorches [harad|E] barren, and only Ladnôca provides relief to the suffering of [conceptmankind|E] through her gift of night and sleep, a reprieve from scorching day.\n\nIt is believed by the scholars of the [dunedain|E] that Ladnôca is a corrupted amalgamation of [vardacharactershort|E], [estecharacter|E], [ariencharacter|E], and perhaps a trans-gendered [tilioncharacter|E]."

 faith_iunast: "Hero-Cult of Iunást"
 faith_iunast_adj: "Iunástic"
 faith_iunast_adherent: "Iunástan"
 faith_iunast_adherent_plural: "Iunástani"
 faith_iunast_desc: "As the legendary folk-hero of the Far-[haradrim|E], [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'lineiunast1' ).GetFirstName] is the emblem of the valor and strength of [conceptracemen|E]. His journey, passed down in the [legend_of_iunast|E], is one of the most important foundational myths of [farharad|E] and thus an integral part of their religion.\n\nThroughout the [thirdage|E], many cults dedicated to the hero-worship of Iunást have sprung up around the [bayoftulwang|E]. Ladnôca and the other gods will often take a more distant role in their worship and in practice, prayer will more commonly be dedicated towards Iunást himself, as well as a variety of local heroes. His followers will often dedicate themselves to fighting evil and opposing the rule of tyrants. Tournaments of martial prowess are common among Iunást's own."
 
 ### Ray ###
 faith_ray: "Kât-Polozây"
 faith_ray_adj: "Kât-Polozây"
 faith_ray_adherent: "Child of the Gods"
 faith_ray_adherent_plural: "Children of the Gods"
 faith_ray_desc: "In [ray|E] is preserved the ancient divine epic of the [haradrim|E], the Kât-Polozây. In the dawn of time, the world was ruled by the Gods from their lofty halls, atop the highest mountain of creation. In those days all the world was lush and verdant, when Nâdi-manyê reigned upon the mountainside. But in time Vâtra brought war to the palaces of Heaven, and the mountain was leveled ere he slew Nâdi-manyê. The physical bodies of the Gods failed in the great battle, and they became as spirits, and then Ladnôca rallied all the Gods. Even those who had previously harkened to Vâtra aligned with her and overthrew Vâtra.\n\nIn rage and fury, unable to harm each other on account of their vows of marriage, Vâtra instead turned his fury on the land which had been Ladnôca's dowry. Where once immense forests and lush lands had been, now only a desert waste endured. Ladnôca could save but a small portion of the world from his fury. Her tears water the lands of [ray|E], and in this land the remnants of [conceptmankind|E] were brought together. From their number came [iunast|E], who did what Ladnôca could not, and banished Vâtra. He freed Mankind from Vâtra's tyranny, though the lands scorched bare would never forget the god's fury. He then was adopted as Ladnôca's son and took his place amongst the gods."
  
 faith_vatra: "Aûdrat Vâtra"
 faith_vatra_adj: "Aûdrat Vâtra"
 faith_vatra_adherent: "Adherent of Vâtra"
 faith_vatra_adherent_plural: "Adherents of Vâtra"
 faith_vatra_desc: "Vâtra, god of Fire and the incarnate Sun, in the traditional [haradrim|E] cosmology is the great rebel and enemy of Ladnôca, ambitious and capricious, who slew the Windlord. But his acolytes tell a different story. In the Vâtran telling of the great story, the sun-god was instead Nâdi-manyê's appointed successor upon his departure from the world, going Beyond in order to join the Gods who had gone before. This was the natural succession of the Divine Generations. But Ladnôca, bitter to have been passed over by her father for her husband, spread dissent among the pantheon and incited revolt against the rightful king.\n\nThe story ends much the same as the traditional Haradrim telling — the rebellion is a success, but to the Vâtrans this is a tragedy, not a triumph. They hold that in time, the Sun-God shall regain his rightful place and humble the pantheon and his wife. Then shall true divine order at last be restored and peace reign across all the lands. The sun and the moon shall contest no more, and the sorrows of Men ended.\n\nThe Aûdrat Vâtra has long since been subverted by [sauroncharacter|E] for his own ends."
 
 faith_tulwang: "Cult of Kîrab-Sarâda"
 faith_tulwang_adj: "Kîrab-Sarâda"
 faith_tulwang_adherent: "Kîrab-Sarâda"
 faith_tulwang_adherent_plural: "Kîrab-Sarâda"
 faith_tulwang_desc: "The Cult of Kîrab-Sarâda was a religion common among the Far-[haradrim|E] of Tûlwang and [anbalkumagan|E]. Its fundamental beliefs are rooted in the text of the same name, which has been preserved since the early [secondage|E]. The writings detail the vast multitudes of gods and spirits that exist within everything, but it also takes an extremely negative view of death and the afterlife. It describes the afterlife as a grey and dull place, where there is no suffering but also no joy, just a silence and your own thoughts until you wish for the release of the void.\n\nThe death-god Tûlimi is thus highly feared in the faith, and there is a ferocious drive to survive and to achieve as much as possible while alive. Vâtra has risen in prominence as the years have gone on, a belief forming that the sun god could perhaps hold the secrets to life unending, a way to avoid the gloomy halls."

 # Kanrâ
 faith_kanra: "Kanrâ"
 faith_kanra_adj: "Kanrâ"
 faith_kanra_adherent: "Follower of Kanrâ"
 faith_kanra_adherent_plural: "Followers of Kanrâ"
 faith_kanra_desc: "In ancient days, the waters of life flowed throughout the world, and those who drunk from them attained eternal life. Yet calamity came, and the waters lost, trapped in the depths of the earth — salt and sand all that was left to those above, the pitiless sun a judge upon them.\n\nCountless generations passed in despair, what water that could be found salty and foul compared to that lost. None could find it, lost in the earth beyond the reach of men. At least not until the coming of Badharkân.\n\nA harsh and exacting soul seemingly born of the desert itself, he delved deep beneath the earth. After many years he found the lost waters, drinking deep from them and attaining eternal life. Returning to the surface, he chose the elect of the people and brought them to his subterranean kingdom, where life was easy, the food lavish, and the water flowed freely.\n\nTo those left behind he gave a law, which if followed, would ensure that he would one day take them too to the blessed lands. The sinners he rebuked, decreeing that they should toil in the harvesting of salt and the extracting of water for the righteous. Thus the faithful strive to live upright lives by the decree of the Netherworld King, lest they fall into disgrace for squandering his blessings which still rise to the surface."
