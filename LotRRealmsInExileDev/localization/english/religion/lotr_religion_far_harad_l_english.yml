She maintains a careful neutrally in the great battle between her sister Ladnôca and Vâtra, god of the Sun. She is grieved by strife amongst both the Gods and [conceptracemen|E], and desires nothing more than to return to the days of old when the world was peaceable and plenty - but the ambitions of Vâtra cannot be quenched, and so instead she focuses on teaching Men the importance of love and pity for one another. If peace amongst the Gods cannot be had, then amongst Men shall be good enough."

 faith_ladnoca_desc:0 "Ladnôca in the traditional [haradrim|E] pantheon is ranked second in importance, only below her father Nâdi-manyê, Windlord and king of the Gods. She is the mother goddess of humanity, and with her father shares the duties of maintaining cosmic balance and temporal justice. She is the wife of Vâtra, but they are long estranged - for Vâtra in his burning ambition and lust for dominion slew Nâdi-manyê and sought to bring all the Heavens under his authority. But Ladnôca rallied the pantheon against him, and in a calamitous battle the home of the Gods upon earth was annihilated, with them becoming spirits who burn still in the sky. Since then, the two have danced in the sky, neither achieving victory over the other. Vâtra's fury scorches [harad|E] barren, and only Ladnôca provides relief to the suffering of [conceptmankind|E] through her gift of night and sleep, a reprieve from scorching day. \n\nIt is believed by the scholars of the [dunedain|E] that Ladnôca is a corrupted amalgamation of [vardacharactershort|E], [estecharacter|E], [ariencharacter|E], and perhaps a trans-gendered [tilioncharacter|E]."

 faith_iunast_adherent_plural:0 "Iunástani"
 faith_iunast_desc:0 "Legendary folk-hero of the Far-[haradrim|E], Iunást is the emblem of the valor and strength of [conceptracemen|E]. Born in a world brought low by the great clash of the Gods, Iunást was a simple goat herder determined to live his simple but honorable life. Yet Doom was upon him, and his fate was for greater things. \n\nIn his thirtieth year, the goddess Ladnôca appeared before him in a dream, telling him of her husband Vâtra's plan to wrought for himself a new form with which to dominate the world again. Heeding the words of the goddess, Iunást gathered a band of companions, and left for the mystical mountains of the east, where Vâtra was gathering his strength. Many trials did he and his companions endure, until there was but two that at last came to Vâtra's darkened city beneath the black mountains. There at last they discovered Vâtra's vessel, blazing with the light of his fell heart, and Iunást strode forward to strike it. Yet with every step his body was consumed by the black flames, for Vâtra's spirit burned hot with hatred for [conceptmankind|E], and indeed, for all things which dared to resist him. Yet at the last he struck it with his sword, silver with the light of the moon, and in Iunást's final moments Vâtra could only roar in fury, for his great plot was halted. \n\nHis sole companion returned home, to tell the tale of his friend's sacrifice and valor. But when he was speaking before the great assembly, in the east a new star arose true and bright, outshining in that hour the Sun - Vâtra - himself. So it came to be believed that Ladnôca in her mercy had taken the spirit of Iunást her champion, and raised him as her own son. Thus ascended, she placed him to keep forever a watch upon the heavens, who lingered when the moon vanishes or precedes the sun. He now remains perched, prepared to strike Vâtra should he ever again attempt to strike the world once more."

 faith_ray_adherent_plural:0 "Children of the Gods"
 faith_ray_desc:0 "In [ray|E] is preserved the ancient divine epic of the [haradrim|E], the Kât-Polozây. In the dawn of time, the world was ruled by the Gods from their lofty halls, atop the highest mountain of creation. In those days all the world was lush and verdant, when Nâdi-manyê reigned upon the mountainside. But in time Vâtra brought war to the palaces of Heaven, and the mountain was leveled ere he slew Nâdi-manyê. The physical bodies of the Gods failed in the great battle, and they became as spirits, and then Ladnôca rallied all the Gods. Even those who had previously harkened to Vâtra aligned with her and overthrew Vâtra. \n\nIn rage and fury, unable to harm each other on account of their vows of marriage, Vâtra instead turned his fury on the land which had been Ladnôca's dowry. Where once immense forests and lush lands had been, now only a desert waste endured. Ladnôca could save but a small portion of the world from his fury. Her tears water the lands of [ray|E], and in this land the remnants of [conceptmankind|E] were brought together. From their number came Iunást, who did what Ladnôca could not, and banished Vâtra. He freed Mankind from Vâtra's tyranny, though the lands scorched bare would never forget the god's fury. He then was adopted as Ladnôca's son and took his place amongst the gods."

 faith_vatra_adherent_plural:0 "Adherents of Vâtra"
 faith_vatra_desc:0 "Vâtra, god of Fire and the Sun, in the traditional [haradrim|E] cosmology is the great rebel and enemy of Ladnôca, ambitious and capricious, who slew the Windlord. But his acolytes tell a different story. In the Vâtran telling of the great story, the sun-god was instead Nâdi-manyê's appointed successor upon his departure from the world, going Beyond in order to join the Gods who had gone before. This was the natural succession of the Divine Generations. But Ladnôca, bitter to have been passed over by her father for her husband, spread dissent among the pantheon and incited revolt against the rightful king. \n\nThe story ends much the same as the traditional Haradrim telling - the rebellion is a success, but to the Vâtrans this is a tragedy, not a triumph. They hold that in time, the Sun-God shall regain his rightful place and humble the pantheon and his wife. Then shall true divine order at last be restored and peace reign across all the lands. The sun and the moon shall contest no more, and the sorrows of Men ended. \n\nThe Aûdrat Vâtra has long since been subverted by [sauroncharacter|E] for his own ends."

 faith_tulwang_adherent:0 "Kîrab-Sarâda"
 faith_tulwang_adherent_plural:0 "Kîrab-Sarâda"
 faith_tulwang_desc:0 "The Cult of Kîrab-Sarâda was a religion common among the Far-[haradrim|E] of Tûlwang and [anbalkumagan|E]. Its fundamental beliefs are rooted in the text of the same name, which has been preserved since the early [secondage|E]. The writings detail the vast multitudes of gods and spirits that exist within everything, but it also takes an extremely negative view of death and the afterlife. It describes the afterlife as a grey and dull place, where there is no suffering but also no joy, just a silence and your own thoughts until you wish for the release of the void. \n\nThe death-god Tûlimi is thus highly feared in the faith, and there is a ferocious drive to survive and to achieve as much as possible while alive. Vâtra has risen in prominence as the years have gone on, a belief forming that the sun god could perhaps hold the secrets to life unending, a way to avoid the gloomy halls."
