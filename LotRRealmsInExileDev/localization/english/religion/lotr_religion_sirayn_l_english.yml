 sirayn_religion_adj:0 "Tayee"
 sirayn_religion_desc:0 "The pantheistic Tayee religion of Sîrayn is ultimately concerned with individual salvation, which can be attained though personal devotion to any one of their myriad deities. For a Tayeen to enter the afterlife, one or several of the gods must be pleased enough with your conduct in life to advocate for them."

 faith_taimaraud_adherent_plural:0 "Taimaraudani"
 faith_taimaraud_desc:0 "In the Tayee pantheon, Taimaraud is traditionally known to be the god of the dead, judge of souls, and patron of magistrates and law-makers. Co-opted by the [ringwraith|E] [khorahil|E], the Cult of Taimaraud was corrupted into an order of assassins, formed to ensure the loyalty of the subjects of the [stormhost|E].\n\nTaimaraudani strike fear into the hearts of all denizens of the Bay of Ormal, for the God of Death demands that each of his followers should claim a life every year for him. Should they not, they are compelled to offer up their own life in compensation. So great is this fear that they have earned for themselves the name Tayb, meaning "avert the gaze", due to the superstition that any that looked upon one of this fell order would meet with a grisly fate, a superstition that often proved true."

 faith_lalit:0 "Cult of Lalit" 
 faith_lalit_adj:0 "Lalitiani"
 faith_lalit_desc:0 "Lalit is the goddess of the home and patron of innkeepers. Although popular throughout Sirayn, few hold Lalit as their foremost goddess or look to her for their salvation. Those who do look to Lalit are known for their compassion and generosity, always eager to lend a helping hand to those in need. Often these followers build extra spare rooms in their homes to welcome travellers and the needy when they have no other place to turn to.\n\nIn the Late Third Age, worship of Lalit was most heavily concentrated in western Sirayn, especially among the merchant communities of Pôwa."

 faith_mirsaya_adj:0 "Mirsayani"
 faith_mirsaya_desc:0 "Mirsaya and Sîrsis are the Tayee goddesses of the flood and rivers, respectively. Mirsaya was originally the single head of the Tayee pantheon, but, during the many crises of the Late Second Age, her worship faded. By the Third Age, her temples were not only shrines to her alone, but also to her eldest daughter Sîrsis, who of old did not own temples herself. In their holy places both are worshipped, recieving offering and prayer in equal measure as Mirsayani pray for calm currents and their life-giving waters.\n\nThe most well known Mirsayan festival is the Feast of Mirsaya, where devotees bathe in the Sîresha river and sing praise to Mirsaya and Sîrsis."

With burning eyes, astride a vicious she-lion, Shyra slaughters her enemies in a terrible frenzy, and can only be tamed by her lover Vinayakam.\n\nShyra's devotees are notorious for their bloodlust. Fierce beyond measure, Shyrani profess that it is a virtue to fight for fighting's sake alone. Though there are few official festivals or prayers associated with the worship of Shyra, many Shyrani warriors chant terrifying 'sword-songs' in her honor, as they engage in combat."

faith_vinaleem_desc:0 "Vinaleem is the goddess of love in all of its forms, and is associated with carnal pleasure and fertility. Patron of lovers and courtesans, her followers tend to be younger than the devotees of most Tayee deities, and are sometimes stigmatised as frivolous hedonists. Nevertheless, she has historically commanded a sizeable following, due to the pleasurable nature of the worship that she requires.\n\nTemples to Vinaleem are colorfully decorated and are often home to the goddess's sacred animal, the peacock."

To her the vengeful and desparate of Sîrayn turn to in their hour of need.\n\nThroughout the Third Age, Yóm-worship has often spread as a reaction to foreign power in Sîrayn. Many Yómani consider Khyan and Lynerian influences to be hostile, and seek to cleanse Sîrayn of them."

faith_num_desc:0 "Nûm, god of knowlege, is the patron of scholars, students, and scribes. No other Tayee faith clings more to the written scriptures of the Tarat Balazayn than the followers of Nûm. To the Nûmani, the very process of learning itself is sacred.\n\nTheir frequent explorations into the hidden meaning within texts, as well as their often dubious claims of enlightenment, have given them a reputation of arrogance among their other Tayee brethren. They steadfastly uphold Sîraynê law as found in the scriptures, and their zeal frequently serves as a bulwark against encroaching missionaries."
