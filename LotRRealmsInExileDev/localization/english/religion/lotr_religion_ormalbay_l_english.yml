 # Arien-Âzie: Reformed Sun Cult
 faith_arienism: "Radiance of Arien"
 faith_arienism_adj: "Arienic"
 faith_arienism_adherent: "Ariene"
 faith_arienism_adherent_plural: "Arienâ"
 faith_arienism_desc: "The Radiance of Arien, known also as the Radiance of Arien-Âzie, is a reformed variant of the traditional solar-worship of Khy. Whereas traditional Âzianic practice places primacy first and foremost on overcoming the darkness within oneself and then teaching others, Arienic doctrine far more forcefully expounds the need to strive against the darkness in the larger world.\n\nMuch as the light of the sun illuminates the whole world, it is the duty of the faithful not just to overcome their own inner darkness and that in their community, but to aggressively seek out the darkness wherever it should hide. One should note that this is not a dogmatic demand that all become Arienâ — indeed, the Arienic Creed recognizes many 'righteous practices' among the peoples of the world. But as for unrighteous practices, the Arienic Creed demands that the faithful blaze with righteous and zealous light, dismantling and destroying the corruption of darkness wherever they should find it." #Established by the Blue Wizards, the Radiance of Arien was built upon existing solar worship within Khy, to provide unity and stability. Dominant in highly populated areas around Khy’s central river.

 # Âzie: Unreformed Sun Cult
 faith_azianic: "Radiance of Âzie" # Traditional faith of Khy, as established by Azmaran the Sage in the early second age
 faith_azianic_adj: "Âzianic"
 faith_azianic_adherent: "Âziane"
 faith_azianic_adherent_plural: "Âzianâ"
 faith_azianic_desc: "The worship of the sun-goddess Âzie established in ancient days by Azmaran the Sage, the faithful of Âzie lift their praises to the sun, guardian and mother to mankind.\n\nÂzianâ hold that the sun is the last source of untainted Light, where all human souls come from and must return to. But the physical world is marred by shadow, and this stain is upon even the soul - only those who master themselves and resist the sins of the world may take the path to the origin of all. Yet not all who do so forsake the world, but instead chose to remain, or return even, and be born anew, to guide others in the ways of righteousness. Until the day when darkness and despair are no more, and the light of the human heart outshines every shadow."

 # Tîlanik: Moon Cult
 faith_tilanik: "Example of Tîlanik"
 faith_tilanik_adj: "Tîlanik"
 faith_tilanik_adherent: "Tîlanike"
 faith_tilanik_adherent_plural: "Tîlanikâ"
 faith_tilanik_desc: "Compared to his twin sister, Tîlanik's light is a lesser one, insufficient to fully banish the darkness of the world. But this is not a source of shame, the faithful say.\n\nFor Tîlanik marred himself for love of his sister, taking the ruinous blows of the Darkness when it tried to disrupt the Ascension of Dawn. If it had succeeded, it may have destroyed both dieties, as well as the scattered primordial light they had so painstakingly rescued from the ends of the earth, while the other gods made war on the Darkness. Seeing the threat at the last, Tîlanik hastily rose, and threw himself between his sister and the full force of the Dark, holding it at bay for six days. On the seventh, his sister rose, born anew in the Light Undiminished, and her wroth set the dark to flight. But Tîlanik's sacrifice had come at great cost - his own light diminished and form scarred. Thus his light became pale silver to his sister's glorious gold, and he lacked the power she had. But he remains steadfast in his duty despite his comparable weakness, wandering the sky even when his sister must rest.\n\nThe followers of Tîlanik thus preach a message of discipline, self-sacrifice, good-works, and charity. After all, if a God could sacrifice much for the good of others, then surely Men can sacrifice but a little?"

 # Iarandel: Earendil/Morningstar Cult Founded with Numenorian Influence
 faith_iarandel: "Light of Iarandel"
 faith_iarandel_adj: "Iarandel"
 faith_iarandel_adherent: "Iarandele"
 faith_iarandel_adherent_plural: "Iarandelâ"
 faith_iarandel_desc: "Though the worship of the sun and moon, Âzie and Tîlanik, has long stood above all others in Khy, they are not the only gods held in reverence. Nor indeed are they the only lights of this world, for when the sun and moon are absent and darkness blankets all, the stars endure.\n\n The greatest of these is the light of the Morningstar, remembered in ancient tongue as Iarandel. Herald and guard of Âzie, Iarandel once was a mortal man, though bearing the blood of the undying. From him came a great king of men, and a manifold many peoples.\n\nFor love of them he risked death and doom alike, leaving behind his sons, braving deepest darkness to ransom the chained stars to the gods. For his sacrifice he transcended as all Men seek, but at the precipice he turned back. He took his place among the stars, forsaking his return to the primordial light, that there may be a beacon of guidance even in the hours of deepest darkness."

 # Hitaspa: Sky Cult of Cly
 faith_hitaspa: "Freedom of Hitâspa"
 faith_hitaspa_adj: "Hitâspa"
 faith_hitaspa_adherent: "Hitâspabande"
 faith_hitaspa_adherent_plural: "Hstâspabandâ"
 faith_hitaspa_desc: "The sky is the blackdrop for many of the faiths of Khy, but to the followers of Hitaspa, it is that which is most worthy of worship.\n\nThe son of Asrûta himself, brother to Angrimâyn, and lord-father to Âzie and Tîlanik, Hitaspa once ruled, but with the rebellion of his brother against the light, he stepped back, allowing for his children's plan to be enacted and succeed. Now his daughter rules from her perch in his sky, with her father alongside her, advising and defending her and his son as they travel across the sky."

 # Uzdâva: Sea-Cult
 faith_uzdava: "Tides of Uzdâva"
 faith_uzdava_adj: "Uzdâva"
 faith_uzdava_adherent: "Uzdâvade"
 faith_uzdava_adherent_plural: "Uzdâvadâ"
 faith_uzdava_desc: "Thoughout Khy, the worship of Âzie and Tîlanik are first and foremost among its people, they are not the only powers of the world - there are earthly powers too, bound to the world, who are the stewards of Men. Uzdâva, the Lord of the Sea and Master of the Tides, is one such force.\n\nIt is said in the oldest of Khyan tales that Uzdâva was once a demon, second of the Zatozdâ in might, and his brother was Akshâtra, the Storm-lord. But when he fought in the great revolt of Angrimâyn, he fought Anahita, the goddess of the Earth, and for ten days and nights the ground quaked while the seas roiled. In the end Uzdâva was thrown down by Anahita, and waited for the death-blow, but she offered her hand instead. Uzdâva, who had been taught by Angrimâyn that the gods would show no mercy, was amazed, and thenceforth became a stalwart ally of the servants of Asrûta.\n\nThough Uzdâva may be redeemed, he is still wrathful and capricious, and the seas reflect his mood - they may be tumultuous one day and calm the next. Despite his temperment, he serves righteousness, and so the followers of Uzdâva preach redemption — if one turned so far away from light may return to it, then everyone deserves a second chance.\n\nUzdâva's followers are also unique in Khy for their eccentric practices - they perform water-births, so that their pain may be borne in part by the Lord of the Seas. They also monitor, study, and pray to the moon and the tides, for they claim that Uzdâva and Tîlanik became stalwart friends, and every day they work together to ply the waves."

 # Ajmo and Vohuma: Cult of Crafts and Wisdom
 faith_ajmo: "Wisdom of Ajmô-Vohuma"
 faith_ajmo_adj: "Ajmô"
 faith_ajmo_adherent: "Ajmôbande"
 faith_ajmo_adherent_plural: "Ajmôbandâ"
 faith_ajmo_desc: "Truth is endlessly maleable, and in those who can bend it rests the ultimate power. Ajmô is a trickster god, a being of wisdom and insight - if you can pin him down and see past his lies. He is the god of skill, and his deft deceits have bound many a Zatozda. Once he even diverted the wrath of Indara from Pelepelplu, challenging the demon to three games of Kaeli, winning all three and freeing the city from her ravages.\n\nAjmô's devotees follow the traditions of their master, valuing skill of hand and tongue. They are a small sect among the people of Ormal, but they are often found in the marketplaces and debate halls of the Bulchyades, and contribute extensively to the wealth and adminstion of that land."

 # Anahita and Manah: Fertility/Health Cult
 faith_anahita: "Blessings of Anahita-Manah"
 faith_anahita_adj: "Anahita"
 faith_anahita_adherent: "Anahitafrid"
 faith_anahita_adherent_plural: "Anahitafridâ"
 faith_anahita_desc: "Anahita is the source of blessings - for health, for the fields, for fertility. Her presence is most felt around Lake Ûlhaïm in $k_mejhanir$, where the Khjana trees dispense healing to those by the shore. Always popular in the south-west of Khy, the worship of Anahita has blended with the Harshandatti cult of Ontheâ and the Mejhani reverence for Manah, taking up more emphasis on love and health. The traditional clergy of Khy look askance upon some of the more Muranian elements of Anahita's cult, but even as other traditional cults fade, the blessing of Anahita remains, a testament to her adaptability and appeal."

 # Fravâd: War Cult
 faith_fravad: "Fear of Fravâd"
 faith_fravad_adj: "Fravâd"
 faith_fravad_adherent: "Fravâde"
 faith_fravad_adherent_plural: "Fravâdâ"
 faith_fravad_desc: "Fravâd is a dangerous god, for his is wild in range and his wrath knows no friends. Yet in his anger he is strong and properly placted his stregnth will shatter enemies.\n\nThe worship of Fravâd grew up in the war-torn regions of the Bulchyades Marches, where he was embraced by a despereate populance. His cult also is found in many an army arcross Khy, until the Vidavan reforms cracked down on the practice. Devotees of Fravâd believe that with the proper prayers and sacrifices, his bloodlust can be quelled until the time comes to face down their foes."

 #Zatozda: Fire and Ash Cult
 faith_zatozda: "Ashen Rites of the Zatozda"
 faith_zatozda_adj: "Zatozdâ"
 faith_zatozda_adherent: "Zatozdâhir"
 faith_zatozda_adherent_plural: "Zatozdâhirâ"
 faith_zatozda_desc: "Originating during the Empire of Khaizula, the Ashen Rite is generally regarded as heretical by most mainstream Khyan thought.\n\nWhile acknowledging many of the same gods, the Ashen Rite deems them ineffectual and focuses instead on the Zatozda. Considered demons by traditional Khyan theology, even the Ashen Rite considers them dangerous deities - but powerful, and not wholly evil. Pacts of blood, fire, sacrifice and ash can bind them in agreements and accord, allowing the faithful to draw upon their fell power.\n\nOnly by these pacts could darkness be kept at bay, they held. They gave themselves (and others) to the fire, body and soul, in sacrificial rites deemed to profane the holy flames of Âzie. Men served these pacts as warriors, while women served as the priests of the faithful, their word law and judgements final. The most terrible and beloved of these were the Flame-Queens, a lineage of high priestesses said to have bound the Zatozda into their very souls, receiving unearthly wisdom and arcane might for the bargain by which they could lead and defend their people.\n\nAfter the fall of Khaizulia, the Ashen Rite saw significant backlash, eventually being driven into the mountains near the Gap of Khy before eventually being extinguished utterly, their sacrificial alters smashed and overturned."

 # Angrimâyn: Darkness Cult
 faith_angrimayn: "Darkness of Angrimâyn"
 faith_angrimayn_adj: "Angrimâyn"
 faith_angrimayn_adherent: "Zatozde" #Devotees were called 'devils' by others
 faith_angrimayn_adherent_plural: "Zatozdâ" #Devotees were called 'devils' by others
 faith_angrimayn_desc: "Long spoken of only in hushed whispers, the worship of Angrimâyn and the Zatozdâ is antithetical to the rest of Khyan religion.\n\nThe Lord of Darkness is a being of fear for others, but the mortal Zatozdâ see the truth; darkness is strength. Angrimâyn saw the victory that darkness could bring forth compared to the meagerness of light, darkness consumed all. The followers of Âzie claim to have defeated Angrimâyn, but they could not be more wrong, for his rule awaits the chosen day, in which all will turn to a darkness greater than any ever seen before.\n\nAs the mortal Zatozdâ await that day, they lie knowing of the darkness found in the skies, the shadows, the depths, the earth, war, and death amass the forces of their lord."

 # Pirates: Bay of Ormal
 faith_ormal_pirate: "Brotherhood of the Apayrabandâ"
 faith_ormal_pirate_adj: "Apayrabandâ"
 faith_ormal_pirate_adherent: "Apayrabande"
 faith_ormal_pirate_adherent_plural: "Apayrabandâ"
 faith_ormal_pirate_desc: "The fearsome Apayrabandâ ply the bountiful waters of the Bay of Ormal in search of treasure, whether from the many merchant fleets that criss-cross its waters, or hidden in the myriad elaborate tombs on its shores. They hail from no particular realm, and bear allgeience to naught but their brothers and the prusuit of riches galore. Bulchyadeans, Anarikêni, Lynerians, Codyans, and more, with the stars in the sky their guide, they voyage ever onwards, setting a course to the other side of the endless ocean blue."
