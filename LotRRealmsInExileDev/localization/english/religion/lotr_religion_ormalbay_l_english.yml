 # Arien-Āzië: Reformed Sun Faith
 faith_arienism: "Radiance of Arien"
 faith_arienism_adj: "Arienic"
 faith_arienism_adherent: "Ariene"
 faith_arienism_adherent_plural: "Arienâ"
 faith_arienism_desc: "The Radiance of Arien, known also as the Radiance of Arien-Āzië, is a reformed variant of the traditional solar-worship of Khy. Whereas traditional Āzianic practice places primacy first and foremost on overcoming the darkness within oneself and then teaching others, Arienic doctrine far more forcefully expounds the need to strive against the darkness in the larger world.\n\nMuch as the light of the sun illuminates the whole world, it is the duty of the faithful not just to overcome their own inner darkness and that in their community, but to aggressively seek out the darkness wherever it should hide. One should note that this is not a dogmatic demand that all become Arienâ — indeed, the Arienic Creed recognizes many 'righteous practices' among the peoples of the world. But as for unrighteous practices, the Arienic Creed demands that the faithful blaze with righteous and zealous light, dismantling and destroying the corruption of darkness wherever they should find it." #Established by the Blue Wizards, the Radiance of Arien was built upon existing solar worship within Khy, to provide unity and stability. Dominant in highly populated areas around Khy’s central river.

 # Āzië: Unreformed Sun Faith
 faith_azianic: "Radiance of Āzië" # Traditional faith of Khy, as established by Azmaran the Sage in the early second age
 faith_azianic_adj: "Āzianic"
 faith_azianic_adherent: "Āziane"
 faith_azianic_adherent_plural: "Āzianâ"
 faith_azianic_desc: "The worship of the sun-goddess Āzië established in ancient days by Azmaran the Sage, the faithful of Āzië lift their praises to the sun, guardian and mother to mankind.\n\nĀzianâ hold that the sun is the last source of untainted Light, where all human souls come from and must return to. But the physical world is marred by shadow, and this stain is upon even the soul - only those who master themselves and resist the sins of the world may take the path to the origin of all. Yet not all who do so forsake the world, but instead chose to remain, or return even, and be born anew, to guide others in the ways of righteousness. Until the day when darkness and despair are no more, and the light of the human heart outshines every shadow."

 # Tîlanik: Moon-Cult
 faith_tilanik: "Example of Tîlanik"
 faith_tilanik_adj: "Tîlanic"
 faith_tilanik_adherent: "Tîlanike"
 faith_tilanik_adherent_plural: "Tîlanikâ"
 faith_tilanik_desc: "Compared to his twin sister, Tîlanik's light is a lesser one, insufficient to fully banish the darkness of the world. But this is not a source of shame, the faithful say.\n\nFor Tîlanik marred himself for love of his sister, taking the ruinous blows of the Darkness when it tried to disrupt the Ascension of Dawn. If it had succeeded, it may have destroyed both dieties, as well as the scattered primordial light they had so painstakingly rescued from the ends of the earth, while the other gods made war on the Darkness. Seeing the threat at the last, Tîlanik hastily rose, and threw himself between his sister and the full force of the Dark, holding it at bay for six days. On the seventh, his sister rose, born anew in the Light Undiminished, and her wroth set the dark to flight. But Tîlanik's sacrifice had come at great cost - his own light diminished and form scarred. Thus his light became pale silver to his sister's glorious gold, and he lacked the power she had. But he remains steadfast in his duty despite his comparable weakness, wandering the sky even when his sister must rest.\n\nThe followers of Tîlanik thus preach a message of discipline, self-sacrifice, good-works, and charity. After all, if a God could sacrifice much for the good of others, then surely Men can sacrifice but a little?"

 # Iarandel: Earendil/Morningstar-Cult Founded with Numenorian Influence
 faith_iarandel: "Light of Iarandel"
 faith_iarandel_adj: "Iarandelic"
 faith_iarandel_adherent: "Iarandele"
 faith_iarandel_adherent_plural: "Iarandelâ"
 faith_iarandel_desc: "Though the worship of the sun and moon, Azië and Tîlanik, has long stood above all others in Khy, they are not the only gods held in reverence. Nor indeed are they the only lights of this world, for when the sun and moon are absent and darkness blankets all, the stars endure.\n\n The greatest of these is the light of the Morningstar, remembered in ancient tongue as Iarandel. Herald and guard of Azië, Iarandel once was a mortal man, though bearing the blood of the undying. From him came a great king of men, and a manifold many peoples.\n\nFor love of them he risked death and doom alike, leaving behind his sons, braving deepest darkness to ransom the chained stars to the gods. For his sacrifice he transcended as all Men seek, but at the precipice he turned back. He took his place among the stars, forsaking his return to the primordial light, that there may be a beacon of guidance even in the hours of deepest darkness."
 
 # Uzdâva: Sea-Cult
 faith_uzdava: "Waters of Uzdâva"
 faith_uzdava_adj: "Uzdâvan"
 faith_uzdava_adherent: "Uzdâvade"
 faith_uzdava_adherent_plural: "Uzdâvadâ"
 faith_uzdava_desc: "Thoughout Khy, the worship of Azië and Tîlanik are first and foremost among its people, they are not the only powers of the world - there are earthly powers too, bound to the world, who are the stewards of Men. Uzdâva, the Lord of the Sea and Master of the Tides, is one such force.\n\nIt is said in the oldest of Khyan tales that Uzdâva was once a demon, second of the Zatozdâ in might, and his brother was Akshâtra, the Storm-lord. But when he fought in the great revolt of Angrimâyn, he fought Anahita, the goddess of the Earth, and for ten days and nights the ground quaked while the seas roiled. In the end Uzdâva was thrown down by Anahita, and waited for the death-blow, but she offered her hand instead. Uzdâva, who had been taught by Angrimâyn that the gods would show no mercy, was amazed, and thenceforth became a stalwart ally of the servants of Asrûta.\n\nThough Uzdâva may be redeemed, he is still wrathful and capricious, and the seas reflect his mood - they may be tumultuous one day and calm the next. Despite his temperment, he serves righteousness, and so the followers of Uzdâva preach redemption — if one turned so far away from light may return to it, then everyone deserves a second chance.\n\nUzdâva's followers are also unique in Khy for their eccentric practices - they perform water-births, so that their pain may be borne in part by the Lord of the Seas. They also monitor, study, and pray to the moon and the tides, for they claim that Uzdâva and Tîlanik became stalwart friends, and every day they work together to ply the waves."

 # Angrimâyn: Darkness Cult
 faith_angrimayn: "Darkness of Angrimâyn"
 faith_angrimayn_adj: "Angrimâynic"
 faith_angrimayn_adherent: "Zatozde"
 faith_angrimayn_adherent_plural: "Zatozdâ"
 faith_angrimayn_desc: "Long spoken of only in hushed whispers, the worship of Angrimâyn and the Zatozdâ is antithetical to the rest of Khyan religion.\n\nThe Lord of Darkness is a being of fear for others, but the mortal Zatozdâ see the truth; darkness is strength. Angrimâyn saw the victory that darkness could bring forth compared to the meagerness of light, darkness consumed all. The followers of Āzië claim to have defeated Angrimâyn, but they could not be more wrong, for his rule awaits the chosen day, in which all will turn to a darkness greater than any ever seen before.\n\nAs the mortal Zatozdâ await that day, they lie knowing of the darkness found in the skies, the shadows, the depths, the earth, war, and death amass the forces of their lord."

 # Bay of Ormal pirate faith
 faith_ormal_pirate: "Brotherhood of Apayrabandâ"
 faith_ormal_pirate_adj: "Apayrabandân"
 faith_ormal_pirate_adherent: "Apayrabande"
 faith_ormal_pirate_adherent_plural: "Apayrabandâ"
 faith_ormal_pirate_desc: "The fearsome Apayrabandâ ply the bountiful waters of the Bay of Ormal in search of treasure, whether from the many merchant fleets that criss-cross its waters, or hidden in the myriad elaborate tombs on its shores. They hail from no particular realm, and bear allgeience to naught but their brothers and the prusuit of riches galore. Bulchyadeans, Anarikêni, Lynerians, Codyans, and more, with the stars in the sky their guide, they voyage ever onwards, setting a course to the other side of the endless ocean blue."
