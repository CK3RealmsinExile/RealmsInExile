 sauronic_religion_adj: "Sauronic"
 sauronic_religion_desc: "After [morgothcharacter|E] was cast into the [thevoid|E] at the end of the [warofwrath|E], [sauroncharacter|E] was the most powerful of his lieutants to escape the justice of the Valar. He first cast himself as the heir of Morgoth, and then as a god of equal (or even greater than) standing with Morgoth, or even that he was Morgoth himself."

 lidless_eye_adj: "The Lidless Eye"
 lidless_eye_adherent: "Servant of the Lidless Eye"
 lidless_eye_adherent_plural: "Servants of the Lidless Eye"
 lidless_eye_desc: "Concealed within His fortress, the Lord of [mordor|E] sees all. His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth, and flesh. An eye, lidless, wreathed in flame. A God upon [middleearth|E], all shall revere Him: [sauroncharacter|E] the Great, Lord of the Earth!\n\nThe official state religion of Sauron's empire, the Cult of the Lidless Eye goes by many names, but all its variants revolve around submission and acknowledgement of the divine authority of Sauron, the Lord of the Earth. His sacraments are administered through [sorcerer|E]-priests trained in the Morgul-arts, and the high-priest is the Steward of Barad-dûr, the [themouthofsauronshort|E]."

 faith_nurniag_adj: "The Eye of Núrn"
 faith_nurniag_adherent: "Overseer"
 faith_nurniag_adherent_plural: "Overseers"
 faith_nurniag_desc: "Resting in dominance over [nurn|E], the Núrniag practitioners of the Cult of the Eye of Núrn are among the [lordofmordor|E]'s most loyal human servants. They gouge themselves upon the fruits of His conquests, whch give them slaves to work their vast plantations. When He is not at waging war, the young and adventurous practitioners of this dark belief set out on slave raids to worship their Lord and secure fame and weath for themselves and their families.\n\nTo those who practice this faith, the fertility of the lands of Núrn are His gift to them, the ashes of His personal forge, [orodruin|E], mixing with the waters which have collected in the basin He personally dug. He is their King and their God, and to Him they offer lavish tributes, enough to keep His vast forces fed, all extracted from the bloodied corpses of their legions of slaves."

 faith_nurn_slave_adj: "Yoke of Shakhbúrz"
 faith_nurn_slave_adherent: "Snaga"
 faith_nurn_slave_adherent_plural: "Snagas"
 faith_nurn_slave_desc: "Forcibly thrust upon the primarily [daen|E] slave-class of [nurn|E], the 'worship' of [shakhburz|E], as they have been taught to call Him by, is that of a god of cruelty incarnate, one punishing a vile and sinful people for the sins of their forefathers. For their lack of faith, for their rebellion and strife against Him, they are forced to labor eternally for His glory. This is all that stays His hand from their total destruction, all which keeps them from complete and total annhililation for their transgressions against His 'glory'.\n\nDespite this deep and systematic oppression, there is a hope still lingers with a select few that they may someday be free of the burden which they bear."

 sons_of_sauron_adherent: "Scion of Shakhbúrz"
 sons_of_sauron_adherent_plural: "Scions of Shakhbúrz"
 sons_of_sauron_desc: "The Age of Men is over, the time of Orcs has come.\n\nThe [orcs|E] of [mordor|E], having experienced living under the power of the great and dreadful power of [shakhburz|E] view all other [conceptraces|E] with hatred, desiring their lands and riches for their own. By their conception, the world rightfully belongs to orc-kind, since they are the strongest, the greatest of those who serve Shakhbúrz.\n\nThe practices of the Shakhbúrzdâgi are a cruder, more primative form of the state-cult of Mordor, which otherwise orthodox orcs ted to revert to without proper #italic guidance#!."
 
 red_eye_cult: "Naukdshu-Fai" 
 red_eye_cult_adj: "Naukdshu-Fai"
 red_eye_cult_adherent: "Naukdshu-Fai Cultist"
 red_eye_cult_adherent_plural: "Naukdshu-Fai Cultists"
 red_eye_cult_desc: "The gaze of the Great Eye is the fount of wisdom, the crucible of understanding, the book in which the secrets of the deep magics are hid! Lesser orcs shrivel and break beneath its burning light, but we comprehend it for the glory it is! We are unworthy of its gaze — but we might prove ourselves worthy. We must work harder, create ever greater magics, forge mightier weapons for the great plan of the Eye!\n\nThe Naukdshu-Fai (Red Eye Cult) is a fringe [orcish|E] group obsessed with [sorcery|E] and the 'blessing' of being pierced by the gaze of the Great Eye. For their maniacal ravings, they were eventually forced into the hills by their saner (by orc standards) kin. Formed by a particularly zealous Orc-shaman who had acquired small scraps of sorcery texts, they desire to prove their worth to [sauroncharacter|E], in the hope he will bless them and acknowledge their teachings."

 faith_angmar_evil: "Cult of the Winter King" # Alternatively, Murazîran
 faith_angmar_evil_adj: "Cult of the Winter King" # Murazîran
 faith_angmar_evil_adherent: "Servant of the Winter King" # Murazîran
 faith_angmar_evil_adherent_plural: "Servants of the Winter King" # Murazîrans
 faith_angmar_evil_desc: "In the lands of winter, respect and homage must be given to its King above all else. He commands the blizzard and the wild animals, and only by supplication and obedience may he be assuaged and calamity averted. All the other gods must bow before him, for his power is manifest and clear.\n\nThe cult of the [witchkingshort|E] of [angmar|E] was his religious tool in ensuring the compliance of his realm. A late addition to the Angmarrim pantheon, the King of Winter (also known as Murazîra) is the incarnate God-King of the world, who commands the elements and natural forces of the world. Ice and the storm is his domain above all others, and the other gods are subordinate to him. Harsh and demanding, the only way to prevent his wrath is to serve him loyally."
