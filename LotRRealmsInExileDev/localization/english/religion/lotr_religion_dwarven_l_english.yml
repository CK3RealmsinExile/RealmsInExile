It is indeed the very blood of Mahal, running in the veins of the earth that is his halls, hidden from the eyes of those who see only the surface of things and not the truth. It is worthy of respect, neigh, veneration! To be hoarded and guarded, not spread to the unworthy and unknowing. Let them have coins of silver and copper - but gold… that by right belongs only to the children of Mahal, who alone understand it’s true worth."

The emissaries said the rings were gifts from a mighty lord to the children of Mahal, tokens of respect, eternal friendship and aid. He promised them the rings would strengthen their gifts and their realms. Yet they proved but poisoned chalices, bringing dragonfire and the [successionofbizaruldum|E]. \n\nThose [blacklocks|E] known as "Axes of Nargubraz" are known and feared across Middle Earth. Sworn enemies of [sauroncharacter|E] and his minions, they have sworn oaths to never return to their home until this grudge is set right. Thrár's boundless pride will only be satisfied when all things Sauron has built have been utterly erased. Only then will his spirit and children find their rest in the halls of their maker [mahalcharacter|E]. To awaken at the end of days and build Arda anew at his side."

 faith_broadbeams_desc:0 "The Houses of the [bluemountains|E] [dwarves|E] have dwelled alongside the [elves|E] of [beleriand|E] and later [lindon|E] since time immemorial. Interaction, influence, and even a degree of friendship was inevitable, and the [broadbeams|E] and many [firebeards|E] developed from these dialogues a deeper understanding of the nature of their father and creator [mahalcharacter|E] "The Maker" and his wife [yavannacharacter|E] "Queen of the Earth." \n\nWhile all [dwarves|E] treat the bounties of stone, the majesties of the living rock and the splendor of caverns bursting with gems with respect and gravity, few among their number truly respect the other bounties the earth can grant, that which is green and grown. But those who follow the teachings of Kemnêl-mesêm hold a deep respect towards all the bounties of the earth, whether it be priceless jewels or common plants, percieving that all are bound up in the great song of the earth."

Reclusively living in the deeps of Buzrâ-Dûm, at the very heart of the hold of defiant flame, where the Sunset Caverns lie. Well known for their rigidly orthodox adherence to the original teachings of [mahalcharacter|E] \n\nWhether it be the [elves|E] of [lindon|E] for their withholding of the Nauglamir, a precious necklace crafted by Nogrod dwarves with a [silmaril|E]. Their own creator's wife [yavannacharacter|E] for sending her wild and savage [ents|E] to slaughter the [firebeards|E] who seized the necklace from the Elves of Doriath, or even their fellow kin. Those who do not hold the Mebelkhags responsible, are just as much at fault as any Elf."

 faith_stiffbeards_desc:0 "All [dwarven|E] houses believe in the fabled Halls of [mahalcharacter|E]. A sacred place in [valinor|E] set aside for [mahalcharacter|E]'s children to await the end of the world and rebuild it at his side. Those who follow Id-Ahlâth Darâg "The Tombs of The Divine", hold that these halls are the very birthplaces of the seven fathers of the Dwarven houses. \n\nMainly practiced by the [stiffbeards|E] of the far north. All Mabiratadnûn "They who remain" return their dead to the birthplace of their house. No matter the distance. This has resulted in the extraordinarily stubborn and sedentary nature of the [stiffbeards|E]. Nearly all of Thúlin the Swift's house have remained in their home since before the first dawn. Those few who have fled the endless hoards of northern foes, must all make the journey home one final time."
