 faith_khazad_desc: "The ancient faith of the [dwarves|E], revolving around the worship of [mahalcharacter|E], their creator and father.

 faith_gold_worship_desc: "Gold. That beautiful, wonderful substance. Its luster alone is self-evident proof of its worth, of its incomparable value. \n\nYet it is far more than a mere metal. It is indeed the very blood of [mahalcharacter|E], running in the veins of the earth that is his halls, hidden from the eyes of those who see only the surface of things and not the truth. It is worthy of respect, neigh, veneration! To be hoarded and guarded, not spread to the unworthy and unknowing. Let them have coins of silver and copper - but gold… that by right belongs only to the children of Mahal, who alone understand its true worth."

 faith_firebeards_adherent: "Mazalikân" # 'They who continue to remember'
 faith_firebeards_adherent_plural: "Mazalikân"
 faith_firebeards_desc: "Practitioners of [Glossary('Khathza-zûl','khathza_zul_gloss')] are those [firebeards|E] who remember every transgression, perceived or real, done to their house. Reclusively living in the deeps of Buzrâ-dûm, they are mostly found at the very heart of the hold of defiant flame, where the Sunset Caverns lie. These [Glossary('Mazalikân','They who continue to remember')] are well known for their rigidly orthodox adherence to the original teachings of [mahalcharacter|E].\n\nWhether it be the [elves|E] of [lindon|E] for their withholding of the [nauglamir|E], a precious necklace crafted by [nogrod|E] Dwarves with a [silmaril|E], their own creator's wife [yavannacharacter|E] for sending her wild and savage [ents|E] to slaughter the [firebeards|E] who seized the necklace from the Elves of Doriath, or even their fellow kin. Those who do not hold the Mebelkhags responsible, are just as much at fault as any Elf."

 faith_broadbeams_desc: "The [dwarves|E] of the [bluemountains|E] have dwelled alongside the [elves|E] of [beleriand|E] and later [lindon|E] since time immemorial. Interaction, influence, and even a degree of friendship was inevitable, and the [broadbeams|E] and many [firebeards|E] developed from these dialogues a deeper understanding of the nature of their father and creator [mahalcharacter|E] 'The Maker' and his wife [yavannacharacter|E] 'Queen of the Earth'.\n\nWhile all Dwarves treat the bounties of stone, the majesties of the living rock and the splendour of caverns bursting with gems with respect and gravity, few among their number truly respect the other bounties the earth can grant, that which is green and grown.\n\nThose who follow the teachings of [Glossary('Kemnêl-mesêm','kemnel_mesem_gloss')], the [Glossary('Bazunâli','bazunal_gloss')], hold a deep reverence for the gifts bestowed by Mahal, whether it be priceless jewels or common plants, perceiving that all are bound up in the great song of the earth."

 faith_stiffbeards_desc: "All [dwarven|E] Houses hold faith in the fabled Halls of [mahalcharacter|E], a sacred realm in [valinor|E] where the children of Mahal will dwell until the world's end, rising again to rebuild it at his side. Among those who follow [Glossary('Id-Ahlâth Darâg','id_ahlath_darag_gloss')], it is believed that these hallowed halls are not merely a final resting place, but the very birthplaces of the seven [dwarffathers|E].\n\nThis faith is most deeply rooted among the [stiffbeards|E] of the far North, where the [Glossary('Mabiratadnûn','mabiratadnun_gloss')] uphold a sacred tradition that the dead must be returned to the birthplace of their house, no matter the distance. Such devotion has shaped a people marked by extraordinary stubbornness and immovability.\n\nNearly all of [thulinsfolk|E] have remained in their ancient homeland since before the first dawn, unmoved by time or calamity. Even those few who have fled the unending hordes of northern foes must, in the end, undertake the long journey home one final time."

 faith_blacklocks_adherent: "Axe of Nargubraz"
 faith_blacklocks_adherent_plural: "Axes of Nargubraz"
 faith_blacklocks_desc: "Revenge is all. In ancient days, emissaries came from afar bearing gifts of two beautiful rings for the [blacklocks|E] and [stonefoots|E]. The emissaries said the rings were gifts from a mighty lord to the children of [mahalcharacter|E], tokens of respect, eternal friendship and aid. He promised them the rings would strengthen their gifts and their realms. Yet they proved but poisoned chalices, bringing dragonfire and the [successionofbizaruldum|E]. \n\nThose [blacklocks|E] known as 'Axes of Nargubraz' are known and feared across [middleearth|E]. Sworn enemies of [sauroncharacter|E] and his minions, they have sworn oaths to never return to their home until this grudge is set right. [thrar|E]'s boundless pride will only be satisfied when all things Sauron has built have been utterly erased. Only then will his spirit and children find their rest in the halls of their maker Mahal. To awaken at the end of days and build Arda anew at his side."
