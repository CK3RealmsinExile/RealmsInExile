 ### Dwarven Religion ###
 dwarven_religion: "Dwarven"
 dwarven_religion_desc: "The [dwarves|E] have a special reverence and worship for the [valagod|E] [aulecharacter|E], their creator, but honour all of the [valargods|E] in turn."
 dwarven_religion_adj: "Dwarven"
 dwarven_religion_adherent: "Dwarf"
 dwarven_religion_adherent_plural: "Dwarves"
 
 faith_khazad: "Khazâd"
 faith_khazad_adj: "Khazâd"
 faith_khazad_adherent: "Khazâd"
 faith_khazad_adherent_plural: "Khazâd"
 faith_khazad_desc: "The ancient faith of the [dwarves|E], revolving around the worship of [mahalcharacter|E], their creator and father. They also deeply revere their history and family honour, taking care to observe their ancestors, making grand tombs and funeral mausoleums, returning themselves to the earth whence they were born.\n\nThe Dwarves hold that Mahal gathers them in halls apart after death, awaiting the Final Battle, after which they shall rebuild the world by his side, their place among the Children of [iluvatar|E] secured."

 faith_eastern_khazad: "Mazaru Mahal"
 faith_eastern_khazad_adj: "Mazaru Mahal"
 faith_eastern_khazad_adherent: "Omzir"
 faith_eastern_khazad_adherent_plural: "Omziri"
 faith_eastern_khazad_desc: "Very similar to their western kin, the eastern [dwarven|E] clans venerate the [valagod|E] [aulecharacter|E], known to them as [mahalcharacter|E]. In an interesting divergence from tradition, the followers of Mazaru Mahal, the [Glossary('Omziri','omziri_gloss')], also hold that throughout [middleearth|E] can be found various workshops of Mahal, where he laboured when the world was young. They believe that each of the awakening locations of the [dwarffathers|E] are counted among these workshops, and that more exist.\n\nThey further hold that if there are workshops, there must have been tools. Such tools are venerated as sacred relics of their creator, and are heirlooms not merely of houses, but of whole holds and clans, passed down in reverence and honour. What are true relics, and what are fakes, has been debated among the clans since time immemorial."

 faith_firebeards: "Khathzâ-zûl" # 'Eternal Memory' These Firebeards have not forgotten a single transgression and reclusively grumble away from the surface world
 faith_firebeards_adj: "Khathzâ-zûl"
 faith_firebeards_adherent: "Mazalikûn" # 'They who continue to remember'
 faith_firebeards_adherent_plural: "Mazalikân"
 faith_firebeards_desc: "Practitioners of [Glossary('Khathza-zûl','khathza_zul_gloss')] are those [firebeards|E] who remember every transgression, perceived or real, done to their house. Reclusively living in the deeps of Buzrâ-dûm, they are mostly found at the very heart of the hold of defiant flame, where the Sunset Caverns lie. These [Glossary('Mazalikân','mazalikan_gloss')] are well known for their rigidly orthodox adherence to the original teachings of [mahalcharacter|E].\n\nWhether it be the [elves|E] of [lindon|E] for their withholding of the [nauglamir|E], a precious necklace crafted by [nogrod|E] Dwarves with a [silmaril|E], their own creator's wife [yavannacharacter|E] for sending her wild and savage [ents|E] to slaughter the [firebeards|E] who seized the necklace from the Elves of Doriath, or even their fellow kin. Those who do not hold the Mebelkhags responsible, are just as much at fault as any Elf."

 faith_broadbeams: "Kemnêl-mesêm" # In an artistic sense 'All the bounties of the earth', literally 'all the jewels of the earth'
 faith_broadbeams_adj: "Kemnêl-mesêm"
 faith_broadbeams_adherent: "Bazunâl" # 'They who garden, harvest, cultivate', whether gold or jewels
 faith_broadbeams_adherent_plural: "Bazunâli"
 faith_broadbeams_desc: "The [dwarves|E] of the [bluemountains|E] have dwelled alongside the [elves|E] of [beleriand|E] and later [lindon|E] since time immemorial. Interaction, influence, and even a degree of friendship was inevitable, and the [broadbeams|E] and many [firebeards|E] developed from these dialogues a deeper understanding of the nature of their father and creator [mahalcharacter|E], and his wife [yavannacharacter|E] ([khuzdul_short|E] [Glossary('Kaminzabdûna','kaminzadbuna_gloss')]).\n\nWhile all Dwarves treat the bounties of stone, the majesties of the living rock and the splendour of caverns bursting with gems with respect and gravity, few among their number truly respect the other bounties the earth can grant, that which is green and grown.\n\nThose who follow the teachings of [Glossary('Kemnêl-mesêm','kemnel_mesem_gloss')], the [Glossary('Bazunâli','bazunal_gloss')], hold a deep reverence for the gifts bestowed by Mahal, whether it be priceless jewels or common plants, perceiving that all are bound up in the great song of the earth."   

 faith_ironfists: "Ozbih Ozil"
 faith_ironfists_adj: "Ozbih Ozil"
 faith_ironfists_adherent: "Ozbiran"
 faith_ironfists_adherent_plural: "Ozbirani"
 faith_ironfists_desc: "Forged in exile after the [warofiron|E], the faith of [Glossary('Ozbih Ozil','ozbih_ozil_gloss')] was born among the scattered [ironfists|E], who had lost their homes, kin, and even the memory of what once was.\n\nDuring their long wandering, the Ironfists came to see memory as their only true wealth. Many of the [Glossary('Ozbirani','ozbirani_gloss')] kept journals in familial cyphers of [khuzdul|E], recording what they had lost and what little they still held. Over time, these writings became archives, and in wealthier holds, full libraries. Among the scattered, stories were instead passed through oral tradition by the [Glossary('Ozokhlitnân','ozokhlitnan_gloss')], when carrying such burdens was not an option.\n\nFrom this need to remember grew a reverence for [vairecharacter|E] (Kh. [Glossary('Bebanuknar','bebanuknar_gloss')]) who preserves all things as they were, without favour or omission. Though these faithful still honour [mahalcharacter|E], it is Vairë who speaks to their struggle.\n\nTo the faithful, forgetting is a betrayal. To misremember is to dishonour the dead. Memory is legacy, and only what is remembered endures."

 faith_stiffbeards: "Id-Ahlâth Darâg" # 'The Tombs of Divine Strength' 
 faith_stiffbeards_adj: "Id-Ahlâth"
 faith_stiffbeards_adherent: "Mabiratadnûn"
 faith_stiffbeards_adherent_plural: "Mabiratadnân" # 'They who remain'
 faith_stiffbeards_desc: "All [dwarven|E] Houses hold faith in the fabled Halls of [mahalcharacter|E], a sacred realm in [valinor|E] where the children of Mahal will dwell until the world's end, rising again to rebuild it at his side. Among those who follow [Glossary('Id-Ahlâth Darâg','id_ahlath_darag_gloss')], it is believed that these hallowed halls are not merely a final resting place, but the very birthplaces of the seven [dwarffathers|E].\n\nThis faith is most deeply rooted among the [stiffbeards|E] of the far North, where the [Glossary('Mabiratadnân','mabiratadnan_gloss')] uphold a sacred tradition that the dead must be returned to the birthplace of their house, no matter the distance. This is most clearly seen in the solemn pilgrimages to [Glossary('Kibiltumun','kibiltumun_gloss')], the great necropolis within [Glossary('Kibilzahar','kibilzahar_gloss')], where generations of the dead are laid to rest in silver-veined tombs. Such devotion has shaped a people marked by extraordinary stubbornness and immovability.\n\nNearly all of [thulinsfolk|E] have remained in their ancient homeland since before the first dawn, unmoved by time or calamity. Even those few who have fled the unending hordes of northern foes must, in the end, undertake the long journey home one final time."

 faith_blacklocks: "Khathzâ Hubnel" # Eternal Vengeance
 faith_blacklocks_adj: "Khathzâ Hubnel"
 faith_blacklocks_adherent: "Id-Ahabûn" # They who avenge
 faith_blacklocks_adherent_plural: "Id-Ahabân" # They who avenge
 faith_blacklocks_desc: "#italic ”Sing, oh Mountains. Sing of the rage of [thrar|E]'s sons, and of the great vengeance. Sing of the Lie, and of the blood of kin spilled, which cannot rest ere [Concept('sauroncharacter', 'the Deceiver')|E] and his works be unmade.”#!\n\nAfter the [warofthelie|E], Nargubraz was sealed, and many of the [blacklocks|E] marched forth. For they had spilled the blood of their kin, staining the very earth and the halls of their ancestors. Only once their sins had been repented, the Deceiver and all his works unmade, could the dead finally rest in peace. This is the creed of the [Glossary('Id-Ahabân','id_ahaban_gloss')], also known as the [axesofnargubraz|E], sworn enemies of Sauron. For he deceived them and led them into woe, and now so they shall in turn bring woe to all who would grant him aid or succour."

 faith_allfather_dwarf: "Amdâru Sulladad" # Mercy of the All-father
 faith_allfather_dwarf_adj: "Amdâru Sulladad"
 faith_allfather_dwarf_adherent: "Mamaddârûn"
 faith_allfather_dwarf_adherent_plural: "Mamaddârân" # They who have mercy
 faith_allfather_dwarf_desc: "A fringe occult rite among the [dwarves|E], the [Glossary('Amdâru Sulladad','amdaru_sulladad_gloss')] focuses foremost not on the reverence of [mahalcharacter|E], as is common among them, but of [Glossary('Sulladad','sulladad_gloss')] himself.\n\nThe faithful place particular emphasis on how Mahal alone could not make the Dwarves — and that when this was revealed to him by Sulladad, he despondently went to destroy his creations, upset and demoralised, both in himself and in them. Only by the grace of Sulladad were the Dwarves ransomed from annihilation; for he perceived in an imperfect creation something good and worthy of salvation.\n\nThe [Glossary('Mamaddârân','mammadaran_gloss')] thus have great patience, holding that imperfections are normal in all things. Mercy and forgiveness are cardinal virtues, for only by them can the broken world hope to be mended. Not with hate, but in seeing the beauty even in broken things."

 faith_gold_worship: "Blood of the Maker"
 faith_gold_worship_adj: "Blood of Golden Mahal"
 faith_gold_worship_adherent: "Child of Gold"
 faith_gold_worship_adherent_plural: "Children of Gold"
 faith_gold_worship_desc: "Gold. That beautiful, wonderful substance. Its luster alone is self-evident proof of its worth, of its incomparable value. \n\nYet it is far more than a mere metal. It is indeed the very blood of [mahalcharacter|E], running in the veins of the earth that is his halls, hidden from the eyes of those who see only the surface of things and not the truth. It is worthy of respect, neigh, veneration! To be hoarded and guarded, not spread to the unworthy and unknowing. Let them have coins of silver and copper - but gold… that by right belongs only to the children of Mahal, who alone understand its true worth."
