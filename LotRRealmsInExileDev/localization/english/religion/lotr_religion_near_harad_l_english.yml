 faith_haruze_desc:0 "In the harsh desert wastes of Near-Harad, the serpent-king of Night, Khäz-gramaze, is praised as the protector of Harad and her people, waging war unending to preserve them from the perverse cruelties of the sea-people and their temperamental god, Malíciam."

 faith_jelut_desc:0 "In the burning desert, few things are permanent, and certainty is scarce. One thing that is certain, however, is the light of Gurzil as he travels across the sky. Though his gaze can be harsh and biting, his stalwart presence also provides comfort and solace to his people as they cross the vast deserts of Harad in their great caravans. Though the world should change, and empires fall, Gurzil's path remains, and so too shall his people."

 faith_lurmsakun_adherent:0 "Makussetite"
 faith_lurmsakun_adherent_plural:0 "Makussetites"
 faith_lurmsakun_desc:0 "The god of death and prophecy is an ever-present weight among the people of sparse Lûrmsakûn. Terrorized by the neighbouring Variags of Khand, the people of Lurmsakun had to come to terms with mortality and death from a very early stage of their society. And strangely indeed, this has resulted in a faith which distant [gondor|E] remarked as 'remarkedly spiritually enlightened', for the adherents of Makusset have come to understand and accept their own mortality, and the transient nature of the world.\n\nRather than vainly strive to postpone their date of departure, those who hear the Lord of Death's decrees instead are charged to live honorable and meaningful lives, not necessarily long ones. One should greet death as a friend, and so he shall greet you in kind, and carry you to a long and quiet sleep, where the world's pains may trouble us no more."

 faith_corsair:0 "Azrîyamanoi" # The Spirits of the Sea
 faith_corsair_adj:0 "Azrîyamanoi"
 faith_corsair_adherent:0 "Azrîyala"
 faith_corsair_adherent_plural:0 "Azrîyalai"
 faith_corsair_desc:0 "Among the superstitious sailors of the Umbarean coast, a cult of two great sea spirits exists, known as the Azrîyamanoi. Malíciam, the lord of the deep, is a harsh lord, capricious in his actions and his deeds. He acts seemingly at random, and can flip between being a dear friend and a deadly foe in an instant. His wife, Uyuninêz, lady of calm waters, is a restraining force on his tempers and wills, but is the weaker of the two. To her sailors cry and make burnt offerings, and among the corsairs it is custom to bear a shrine to both of the great spirits on every ship.\n\nArising from the Númenórean (and subsequent Black Númenórean and Dúnedain) dominance of the region of Umbar and the natives that lived there, the worship of Malíciam and Uyuninêz is a corrupted fusion of the Haradrim fear of the sea god (Malíciam), and the Númenórean reverence for the Maiar of Ulmo, Osse and Uinen."

 faith_chelkar_adherent_plural:0 "Faithful"
 faith_chelkar_desc:0 "In ancient times, before the rise of Sauron's influence, the Haradrim worshipped an entire pantheon of gods ruled over by Nâdi-manyê the Windlord. Sitting at the confluence of empires, it was highly tolerant and adaptive, absorbing many aspects from Númenor, Rhûn, and Khand. \n\nBy the later Third Age, this faith has become a persecuted minority by the ascendant faith of the Serpent-King, Khäz-gramaze."
 
 ### Faiths of the Dune Sea ###

 faith_sanbaiz_adj:0 "Sanbaizani"
 faith_sanbaiz_adherent:0 "Sanbaizan"
 faith_sanbaiz_adherent_plural:0 "Sanbaizani"
 faith_sanbaiz_desc:0 "The Spider-God, Sanbaiz, is patron of witches, thieves, apostates, traitors, and murderers. Dark rituals, plots, schemes, and intrigue are the standard for the tribes who uphold the spider-lord's rites deep in the Dune Sea. Even among those that serve the darkness, there is a certain... unease, concerning those that follow the Great Spider. They know little shame, freely flaunting their plots, delighting in the great game of wits. They embrace life with a lighthearted facetiousness that borders on mockery, living by a creed of 'if you can get away with it, do it'\n\nThe Sanbaizani arose among some tribes in the northeastern Dune Sea relatively recently. These coven-tribes claim to have been taught their dark secrets by a woman known as the 'Mother of Shades'. Her myth is recounted in the Tale of [the_girl_and_the_spider|E], although the details vary greatly from tribe to tribe. Uniquely, women hold a higher position than men in their tribal hierarchy. Murder is not uncommon in their hidden refuges, embraced as a form of cunning defiance against the cruelty of the world."

 faith_garauda_desc:0 "Long a source of bafflement for foreign scholars, Garauda is the lord of goats. In the grand cosmology of the Haradrim, he is barely mentioned, yet his cult has remained one of the most enduring in all of Far Harad. In truth, he is an ancient import of Sîrayn, but was adopted with gusto by the Haradrim living in the harsh, rocky lands of the southwest Dune Sea. In Sîrayn the cult has long declined to the point of disappearence, but in Harad it has endured, much like the stalwart goats he is master of, which the Aukuag and Qarsag rely upon for their livelihoods. Yet his traits of simple life, stout resilience, and kind hospitality to strangers has won him great admiration in the harsher lands of Harad."

 faith_arani_desc:0 "Deep within the Dune Sea there exist many myriad cults and traditions of the Scorpion-God, Shâsmekh. Indeed, to many tribes in those barren dunes, he has taken prominence over the Windlord as leader of the traditional [haradrim|E] pantheon, the patron of the nomads and caravaneers that attempt to cross its vast wastes.\n\nShâsmekh himself is often depicted as a titanic scorpion that rests deep beneath the Dune Sea. Whenever he breathes, great sandstorms are unleashed. Whenever he stirrs, the dunes shift and swallow those who tread carelessly upon them. \n\nShâsmekh is often depicted as the great adversary of Gurzil, who treads across the sky and whose light relentlessly burns the sands. Shrines to Shâsmekh are often built using the discarded shells of the Great Scorpions native to the Dune Sea, which offer shade and protection. The giant scorpions themselves are considered sacred tools of Shâsmekh's will."
