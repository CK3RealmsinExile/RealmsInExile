 ### Faiths of Harad ###
 faith_haruze: "Cult of Khäz-gramaze"
 faith_haruze_adj: "Khäz-gramaze"
 faith_haruze_adherent: "Khäzgramite"
 faith_haruze_adherent_plural: "Khäzgramite"
 #faith_haruze_desc: "In the harsh desert wastes of [nearharad|E], the serpent-king of Night, Khäz-gramaze, is praised as the protector of [harad|E] and her people, waging war unending to preserve them from the perverse cruelties of the sea-people and their temperamental god, Malíciam."
 faith_haruze_desc: "Among the peoples of [harad|e], none are more cruel, more zealous and more dreaded than the followers of Khäz-gramaze, the great and terrible god of night and shadow. The followers of Khäz-gramaze hold that their god, as the Lord of Night, uses his divine power to keep the scorching light of the sun from buring the world into a barren and lifeless desert. As such, all of mankind holds allegiance to him as the only saviour of life and must follow his every command. \n\nIt is the duty of any true Khäz-gramaze to join the great armies of the shadow, fighting in the unending war of their god and master against the peoples of coasts, Adûnai or Dúnedain alike, who they believe have made dark pacts with the foul god of the seas Malicìam for unholy power and strength. \n\nFabricated from almost nothing by Sauron, the Cult of Khäz-gramaze has long served the interests of the Dark Lord and his many servants across Harad."
 faith_jelut: "Path of Gurzil"
 faith_jelut_adj: "Gurzilikä"
 faith_jelut_adherent: "Gurzilikän"
 faith_jelut_adherent_plural: "Gurzilikän"

 faith_jelut_old_adj: "Old Gurzilikä"
 faith_jelut_old_adherent: "Old Gurzilikän"
 faith_jelut_old_adherent_plural: "Old Gurzilikän"
 faith_jelut_desc: "In the burning desert, few things are permanent, and certainty is scarce. One thing that is certain, however, is the light of Gurzil as he travels across the sky. Though his gaze can be harsh and biting, his stalwart presence also provides comfort and solace to his people as they cross the vast deserts of Harad in their great caravans. Though the world should change, and empires fall, Gurzil's Path remains, and so too shall his people."
 
 faith_lurmsakun: "Cult of Makusset"
 faith_lurmsakun_adj: "Makusseti"
 faith_lurmsakun_adherent: "Makussetite"
 faith_lurmsakun_adherent_plural: "Makussetites"

 faith_lurmsakun_old_adj: "Old Makusseti"
 faith_lurmsakun_old_adherent: "Old Makussetite"
 faith_lurmsakun_old_adherent_plural: "Old Makussetites"
 faith_lurmsakun_desc: "The god of death and prophecy is an ever-present weight among the people of sparse Lûrmsakûn. Terrorized by the neighbouring Variags of [khand|E], the people of Lûrmsakûn had to come to terms with mortality and death from a very early stage of their society. And strangely indeed, this has resulted in a faith which distant [gondor|E] remarked as 'remarkedly spiritually enlightened', for the adherents of Makusset have come to understand and accept their own mortality, and the transient nature of the world.\n\nRather than vainly strive to postpone their date of departure, those who hear the Lord of Death's decrees instead are charged to live honorable and meaningful lives, not necessarily long ones. One should greet death as a friend, and so he shall greet you in kind, and carry you to a long and quiet sleep, where the world's pains may trouble us no more."

 faith_chelkar_adj: "Nâdi-manyê"
 faith_chelkar_adherent: "Amedan"
 faith_chelkar_adherent_plural: "Amedani"
 faith_chelkar_desc: "In ancient times, before the rise of [sauroncharacter|E]'s influence, the [haradrim|E] worshipped an entire pantheon of gods ruled over by Nâdi-manyê the Windlord. Sitting at the confluence of empires, it was highly tolerant and adaptive, absorbing many aspects from [numenor|E], [rhun|E], and [khand|E]. \n\nBy the later [thirdage|E], this faith has become a persecuted minority by the ascendant faith of the Serpent-King, Khäz-gramaze."
 
 ### Faiths of the Dune Sea ###
 faith_sanbaiz: "Cult of Sanbaiz"
 faith_sanbaiz_adj: "Sanbaizani"
 faith_sanbaiz_adherent: "Sanbaizan"
 faith_sanbaiz_adherent_plural: "Sanbaizani"

 faith_sanbaiz_old_adj: "Old Sanbaizani"
 faith_sanbaiz_old_adherent: "Old Sanbaizan"
 faith_sanbaiz_old_adherent_plural: "Old Sanbaizani"
 faith_sanbaiz_desc: "The Spider-God, Sanbaiz, is patron of witches, thieves, apostates, traitors, and murderers. Dark rituals, plots, schemes, and intrigue are the standard for the tribes who uphold the spider-lord's rites deep in the Dune Sea. Even among those that serve the darkness, there is a certain... unease, concerning those that follow the Great Spider. They know little shame, freely flaunting their plots, delighting in the great game of wits. They embrace life with a lighthearted facetiousness that borders on mockery, living by a creed of 'if you can get away with it, do it'\n\nThe Sanbaizani arose among some tribes in the northeastern Dune Sea relatively recently. These coven-tribes claim to have been taught their dark secrets by a woman known as the 'Mother of Shades'. Her myth is recounted in the Tale of [the_girl_and_the_spider|E], although the details vary greatly from tribe to tribe. Uniquely, women hold a higher position than men in their tribal hierarchy. Murder is not uncommon in their hidden refuges, embraced as a form of cunning defiance against the cruelty of the world."

 faith_arani: "Cult of Shâsmekh"
 faith_arani_adj: "Shâsmekhani"
 faith_arani_adherent: "Shâsmekhan"
 faith_arani_adherent_plural: "Shâsmekhani"

 faith_arani_old_adj: "Old Shâsmekhani"
 faith_arani_old_adherent: "Old Shâsmekhan"
 faith_arani_old_adherent_plural: "Old Shâsmekhani"
 faith_arani_desc: "Deep within the Dune Sea there exist many myriad cults and traditions of the Scorpion-God, Shâsmekh. Indeed, to many tribes in those barren dunes, he has taken prominence over the Windlord as leader of the traditional [haradrim|E] pantheon, the patron of the nomads and caravaneers that attempt to cross its vast wastes.\n\nShâsmekh himself is often depicted as a titanic scorpion that rests deep beneath the Dune Sea. Whenever he breathes, great sandstorms are unleashed. Whenever he stirrs, the dunes shift and swallow those who tread carelessly upon them. \n\nShâsmekh is often depicted as the great adversary of Gurzil, who treads across the sky and whose light relentlessly burns the sands. Shrines to Shâsmekh are often built using the discarded shells of the Great Scorpions native to the Dune Sea, which offer shade and protection. The giant scorpions themselves are considered sacred tools of Shâsmekh's will."
 
 faith_legends_of_harwan: "Legends of Harwan"
 faith_legends_of_harwan_adj: "Harwani"
 faith_legends_of_harwan_adherent: "Harwanean"
 faith_legends_of_harwan_adherent_plural: "Harwani"
 faith_legends_of_harwan_desc: "The cults of [nearharad|E] are as innumerable as the sands of the desert, a great cacophony of different creeds and tales. Compared with traditions that elevate one god or divine order over another, the faithful of these cults rarely devote themselves to a single deity or system of belief, often worshipping many simultaneously in spite of what, to foreigners, may seem to be contradictions. The theology between the cults and their views of the divine are not very coherent, but a shared thread is the notion of deities as facets or divine representations of aspects of life. The temples which dot the land are places for the faithful to commune with the spirits, both greater and lesser, and often feature great idols built in the shape of animals believed to embody the essence of the god or goddess in question."

 faith_teachings_of_the_tirael_old_adherent_plural: "Old Tîraeli"
 faith_teachings_of_the_tirael_desc: "When [conceptracemen|E] first entered the land which would become known as [harad|E] in days thereafter, the land was one that was harsh, but fair in its own measure. Yet the element most rueful to the [conceptrace|E] of Men was the light of the Sun, which above them seemed to burn hotter than it ever had in the East. Thus, many of the men of the region sought places of relief from its burning gaze, dwelling in dark caves and gorges, furtive and fearful of its wrath. After a time, however, they were approached by a strange group of wanderers, who, upon hearing of their plight, bid them to sleep. They did, and the strangers awoke them at night, and bid them rise and join them. To their wonderment, they found the gentle light of the moon and stars radiant, beauties which they could not behold before, blotted out by the burning gaze of the sun. Thus did night free the Men, and in great joy they danced with the wanderers in the wind, forever after known to them as the Tîrael. No longer thereafter did the Men fear the sun, knowing its wrath would fade, but basked in the light of the moon and the stars. As the land turned ever more brutal and the sun ever hotter, these teachings of moon and star would be treasured ever more."
