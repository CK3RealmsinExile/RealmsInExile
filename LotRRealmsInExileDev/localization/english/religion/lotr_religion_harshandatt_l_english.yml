 harshandatt_religion: "Harshandattian" 
 harshandatt_religion_adj: "Harshandattan"
 harshandatt_religion_desc: "Dualistic in nature, religious practice in Harshandatt centres around two conflicting sets of gods, the light pantheon of Anhûr and the dark pantheon of Sâdeh. Through their blessing, the Nhazadh receives a mandate to rule as a god-king among men."
 harshandatt_religion_adherent: "Harshandattan"
 harshandatt_religion_adherent_plural: "Harshandattans"
 
 faith_nhazadh: "Mandate of the Nhazadh"
 faith_nhazadh_adj: "Nhazadhan"
 faith_nhazadh_adherent: "Nhazadhan"
 faith_nhazadh_adherent_plural: "Nhazadhans"
 faith_nhazadh_desc: "Orthodox Harshandattian belief emphasizes the divinity of the Nhazadh above all other aspects of practice. The Nhazadh is not simply a king blessed by the gods, but a fully-fledged living god himself, and his every word is divine law.\n\nThe Nhazadh is understood to be the incarnate divine son of Saath, his father either Anhûr or his brother Sâdeh, sent to rule over the faithful of mankind."

 faith_sadeh: "Revelation of Sâdeh"
 faith_sadeh_adj: "Sâdehan"
 faith_sadeh_adherent: "Revealed"
 faith_sadeh_adherent_plural: "Revealed"
 faith_sadeh_desc: "The followers of Sâdeh do not plead for guidance, they submit to it. Sâdeh, called the Mirror of Heaven and the Architect of Truth, is the divine rebel who cast down the old order not to destroy it, but to perfect it. Where others saw chaos, he saw opportunity; where others worshipped light, he asked who held the torch. He speaks through sacred decrees and iron-bound laws, proclaiming a new covenant of order built upon ambition, dominion, and spiritual union.\n\nTo the Revealed, power is a sign of divine favour, and law is a holy weapon. Those who climb do so with his blessing, provided they remake the world in his image. Some among them willingly offer their bodies to his will, becoming vessels of divine presence, anointed by possession, reshaped by his touch. These few are not prophets but instruments, carrying out the will of the one true lawgiver, whose commands are written in storm and blood."

 faith_saath: "Sons of Saath the Sun"
 faith_saath_adj: "Saathan"
 faith_saath_adherent: "Saathan"
 faith_saath_adherent_plural: "Saathans"
 faith_saath_desc: "The Nhazadhs of the Mejhanian Kingdom would seek to reconcile the faiths of Harshandatt with that of imperial Khy. By associating the goddess Saath's dominion over the seasons with the light of the sun, they would reason that she was, in fact one and the same with Arien-Âzie, whom the Khyans held so dear. Importantly, this association would not reduce the legitimacy of the divine rule of the Nhazadh over Harshandatt, since it was Saath that the Nhazadh had always claimed divine descent from, even in the periods of Sâdeh's dominance."

 faith_anhur: "Cult of Anhûr"
 faith_anhur_adj: "Anhûran"
 faith_anhur_adherent: "Anhûran"
 faith_anhur_adherent_plural: "Anhûrans"
 faith_anhur_desc: "A movement seeking to reconcile the disparate beliefs of Harshandatt and Sîrayn, the Cult of Anhûr does away with the divinity of the Nhazadh in favour of the salvationist theology of Sîrayn. Popularised among the disgrunteled Núara peasantry, distanced a certain degree from ancient Muranian custom, the monolatrous cultic veneration of Anhûr nonetheless continued to hold dear the classical scriptural corpus of Harshandatt, no less correct than the Tarat Barzain of Sîrayn, provided it could be interpreted suitably metaphorically. This heresy of course outraged the Nhazadh, which only further served to endear it to those who would live free of the reign of a self-appointed god among Men."

 faith_harackt: "Guardians of the Tombs"
 faith_harackt_adj: "Haracktish"
 faith_harackt_adherent: "Tomb-keeper"
 faith_harackt_adherent_plural: "Tomb-keepers"
 faith_harackt_desc: "Among the disinfranched Muranians of Harshandatt, a strange belief has developed in the hills. Founded by Harackt the Sage durring the Mejhanian Kingdom, the Guardians of the Tombs hold fast to the ancient graves of their forefathers, guarding their treasures and defending their secrets. The Tomb-keepers believe that someday to come their ancient kings shall be reborn among the faithful, and once again lead their people to greatness. Until that day the duty of the Tomb-keepers is to watch and wait, hoping that soon their hope shall be fufil and their nation restored."

 faith_nuar: "Núarism"
 faith_nuar_adj: "Núarite"
 faith_nuar_adherent: "Listener"
 faith_nuar_adherent_plural: "Listeners"
 faith_nuar_desc: "All people of Harshandatt revere the Núar river, for it brings life and plenty. Among some however, this devotion goes even further. As the traditional pantheons are Harshandatt failed and the land once again divided in strife, the folk of the Núar found solace in the river, and it took first place in their hearts. To the Listeners, the river is creator and dearest friend, a comfort and refuge against the evils of the day. The river hears their pleas, and to its favoured returns wisdom and saftey. They hold that the river was first in the world, and from it flow all things, and to it will return all things, the river enduring through all troubles. As the river flows eternal, so too do its people, quietly living alongside their friend and defender, content to endure knowing that in the end all things shall pass."

 faith_yashar: "Disciples of Yashar"
 faith_yashar_adj: "Yasharan"
 faith_yashar_adherent: "Yasharan"
 faith_yashar_adherent_plural: "Yasharans"
 faith_yashar_desc: "The Disciples of Yashar revere the divine hand of Yashar, the World-Mender, who shaped the first tools and taught mortals to build, bind, and heal. Among the faithful, every act of creation is sacred, and every act of repair a holy rite. Artisans and healers are seen not merely as craftsmen, but as servants of the divine design, mending what has been broken, be it flesh, stone, or soul.\n\nThough Yashar is neither light nor dark, many believe he was once a servant of Anhûr, who turned away from divine quarrels to walk among mortals and show them how to shape the world with their hands. His temples are quiet halls of labour and learning, where hammers sing and wounds are bound, and his worshippers seek not glory or dominion, but harmony in their craft and service to the community."

 faith_taharru: "Order of Taharru"
 faith_taharru_adj: "Taharran"
 faith_taharru_adherent: "Scribe"
 faith_taharru_adherent_plural: "Scribes"
 faith_taharru_desc: "The Order of Taharru devotes itself to the pursuit of knowledge and the preservation of truth. Its adherents believe that Taharru was once the messenger of Anhûr, gifted with perfect recall and tasked with recording the deeds of gods and men alike. To his followers, wisdom is sacred, and the written word is a vessel of divine memory. What is written endures, even as empires fall and rivers change course.\n\nThe Scribes maintain great scriptoria and hidden libraries across Harshandatt, preserving not only sacred texts but the histories, discoveries, and laws of the old world. In times of war or madness, they are often persecuted for the truths they keep, yet their role as preservers of balance and order is honoured even by their foes.\n\nTo write is to resist decay, and to know is to draw nearer to the divine."

 faith_nakhurta: "Children of Nakhurta"
 faith_nakhurta_adj: "Nakhurtan"
 faith_nakhurta_adherent: "Watcher"
 faith_nakhurta_adherent_plural: "Watchers"
 faith_nakhurta_desc: "Nakhurta, the Cloaked One, was once the lioness of the hearth, a guardian goddess of warmth and kin. But the old tales speak of how the dark god Sâdeh, whose attentions she had spurned, slew her cubs and bound her in chains beneath the mountains, where she howled for a thousand years in isolation and shadow. When she rose again, it was not as she had been, but as a dark force sharpened by sorrow and fire. No longer merely a protector, she became a memory that could not be erased, a vengeance that could not be reasoned with.\n\nTo her faithful, Nakhurta is the soul of Harshandatt made manifest: beaten, scarred, but unbroken. Her worship is quiet but absolute, found in hidden shrines, etched in worn cloth, and sworn in blood. She does not forget. She does not forgive. In every generation she raises those who will endure the yoke, learn the names of the guilty, and one day, reclaim what was taken. For to honour Nakhurta is to swear never again to be chained, never again to be silent, and never again to let the innocent die."

 faith_sened: "Cult of Senêd"
 faith_sened_adj: "Senêdic"
 faith_sened_adherent: "Stormbound"
 faith_sened_adherent_plural: "Stormbound"
 faith_sened_desc: "The dark god Senêd is the storm given will, the wind given voice, the fury of heaven made flesh. Once a mortal commander, raised to undeath and exalted by the dark gods, the Storm-Lord led the conquest that shattered the Old Kingdom and drowned its cities beneath thunder and ash. His followers believe that storm and ruin are not curses, but the natural order, and that the sky must break for a new world to rise.\n\nTo the Stormbound, domination is divine. The strong must seize the weak, just as the lightning rends the sky. In the howling gale, they hear Senêd’s call: to break chains not for freedom, but to forge new ones. His worshippers burn away the old to make room for the inevitable, believing resistance to be foolish and memory to be weakness. In their rites, they summon storms, offer blood at the shore, and exalt the raw, cleansing chaos of conquest.\n\nWhere Senêd walks, no roots are left unuprooted, and no law but his will remains."
