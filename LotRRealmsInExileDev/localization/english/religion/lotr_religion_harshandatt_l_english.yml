 harshandatt_religion: "Harshandattian" 
 harshandatt_religion_adj: "Harshandattan"
 harshandatt_religion_desc: "Dualistic in nature, religious practice in Harshandatt centres around two conflicting sets of gods, the light pantheon of Anhûr and the dark pantheon of Sâdeh. Through their blessing, the Nhazadh receives a mandate to rule as a god-king among men."
 harshandatt_religion_adherent: "Harshandattan"
 harshandatt_religion_adherent_plural: "Harshandattans"
 
 faith_nhazadh: "Mandate of the Nhazadh"
 faith_nhazadh_adj: "Nhazadhan"
 faith_nhazadh_adherent: "Nhazadhan"
 faith_nhazadh_adherent_plural: "Nhazadhans"
 faith_nhazadh_desc: "Orthodox Harshandattian belief emphasizes the divinity of the Nhazadh above all other aspects of practice. The Nhazadh is not simply a king blessed by the gods, but a fully-fledged living god himself, and his every word is divine law.\n\nThe Nhazadh is understood to be the incarnate divine son of Saath, his father either Anhûr or his brother Sâdeh, sent to rule over the faithful of mankind."

 faith_sadeh: "Pantheon of Sâdeh"
 faith_sadeh_adj: "Sâdehan"
 faith_sadeh_adherent: "Sâdehan"
 faith_sadeh_adherent_plural: "Sâdehans"
 faith_sadeh_desc: "Worship of the dark pantheon of Sâdeh first took hold in Harshandatt in the aftermath of the collapse of the Old Kingdom in the Second Age, in no small part due to the memory of the Nazgûl Khôrahil's all too recent assaults. Appealing to the dark gods, many sought to claim the title of Nhazadh for themselves, through the treachery of Sâdeh, the trickery of Kyrdeahtu his messenger, the insidious darkness of Lyayun, the foam-filled rage of Telear, or the wicked sorcery of the storm god Senêd. Time and again the dark pantheon reared it's ugly head in Harshandatt, ushering in the end of many a kingdom."

 faith_saath: "Sons of Saath the Sun"
 faith_saath_adj: "Saathan"
 faith_saath_adherent: "Saathan"
 faith_saath_adherent_plural: "Saathans"
 faith_saath_desc: "The Nhazadhs of the Mejhanian Kingdom would seek to reconcile the faiths of Harshandatt with that of imperial Khy. By associating the goddess Saath's dominion over the seasons with the light of the sun, they would reason that she was, in fact one and the same with Arien-Âzie, whom the Khyans held so dear. Importantly, this association would not reduce the legitimacy of the divine rule of the Nhazadh over Harshandatt, since it was Saath that the Nhazadh had always claimed divine descent from, even in the periods of Sâdeh's dominance."

 faith_anhur: "Cult of Anhûr"
 faith_anhur_adj: "Anhûran"
 faith_anhur_adherent: "Anhûran"
 faith_anhur_adherent_plural: "Anhûrans"
 faith_anhur_desc: "A movement seeking to reconcile the disparate beliefs of Harshandatt and Sîrayn, the Cult of Anhûr does away with the divinity of the Nhazadh in favour of the salvationist theology of Sîrayn. Popularised among the disgrunteled Núara peasantry, distanced a certain degree from ancient Muranian custom, the monolatrous cultic veneration of Anhûr nonetheless continued to hold dear the classical scriptural corpus of Harshandatt, no less correct than the Tarat Barzain of Sîrayn, provided it could be interpreted suitably metaphorically. This heresy of course outraged the Nhazadh, which only further served to endear it to those who would live free of the reign of a self-appointed god among Men."

 faith_harackt: "Guardians of the Tombs"
 faith_harackt_adj: "Haracktish"
 faith_harackt_adherent: "Tomb-keeper"
 faith_harackt_adherent_plural: "Tomb-keepers"
 faith_harackt_desc: "Among the disinfranched Muranians of Harshandatt, a strange belief has developed in the hills. Founded by Harackt the Sage durring Mejhanian Kingdom, the Guardians of the Tombs hold fast to the ancient gravs of their forefathers, guarding their treasures and defending their secrets. The Tomb-keepers believe that someday to come their ancient kings shall be reborn among the faithful, and once again lead their people to greatness. Until that day the duty of the Tomb-keepers is to watch and wait, hoping that soon their hope shall be fufil and their nation restored."

 faith_nuar: "Núarism"
 faith_nuar_adj: "Núarite"
 faith_nuar_adherent: "Listener"
 faith_nuar_adherent_plural: "Listeners"
 faith_nuar_desc: "All people of Harshandatt revere the Núar river, for it brings life and plenty. Among some however, this devotion goes even further. As the traditional pantheons are Harshandatt failed and the land once again divided in strife, the folk of the Núar found solace in the river, and it took first place in their hearts. To the Listeners, the river is creator and dearest friend, a comfort and refuge against the evils of the day. The river hears their pleas, and to its favoured returns wisdom and saftey. They hold that the river was first in the world, and from it flow all things, and to it will return all things, the river enduring through all troubles. As the river flows eternal, so too do its people, quietly living alongside their friend and defender, content to endure knowing that in the end all things shall pass."

 faith_yashar_adj: "Yasharan"
 faith_yashar_adherent: "Yasharan"
 faith_yashar_adherent_plural: "Yasharans"
 faith_yashar_desc: "The Disciples of Yashar revere the divine hand of Yashar, the World-Mender, who shaped the first tools and taught mortals to build, bind, and heal. Among the faithful, every act of creation is sacred, and every act of repair a holy rite. Artisans and healers are seen not merely as craftsmen, but as servants of the divine design, mending what has been broken, be it flesh, stone, or soul.\n\nThough Yashar is neither light nor dark, many believe he was once a servant of Anhûr, who turned away from divine quarrels to walk among mortals and show them how to shape the world with their hands. His temples are quiet halls of labour and learning, where hammers sing and wounds are bound, and his worshippers seek not glory or dominion, but harmony in their craft and service to the community."

 faith_taharru_adj: "Taharran"
 faith_taharru_adherent: "Scribe"
 faith_taharru_adherent_plural: "Scribes"
 faith_taharru_desc: "The Order of Taharru devotes itself to the pursuit of knowledge and the preservation of truth. Its adherents believe that Taharru was once the messenger of Anhûr, gifted with perfect recall and tasked with recording the deeds of gods and men alike. To his followers, wisdom is sacred, and the written word is a vessel of divine memory. What is written endures, even as empires fall and rivers change course.\n\nThe Scribes maintain great scriptoria and hidden libraries across Harshandatt, preserving not only sacred texts but the histories, discoveries, and laws of the old world. In times of war or madness, they are often persecuted for the truths they keep, yet their role as preservers of balance and order is honoured even by their foes.\n\nTo write is to resist decay, and to know is to draw nearer to the divine."

 faith_nakhurta_adj: "Nakhurtan"
 faith_nakhurta_adherent: "Ward"
 faith_nakhurta_adherent_plural: "Wards"
 faith_nakhurta_desc: "Nakhurta, the Cloaked One, is remembered not in grand temples but in the quiet places, at the thresholds of homes, in the patterns of woven cloth, and in the stories whispered to children when soldiers pass too close. She is the lioness of the hearth, the silent guardian of her people, and the mantle drawn over a land long trampled by foreign boots. To call on Nakhurta is to endure without surrender, to protect without forgetting.\n\nThough she does not promise vengeance, her presence is defiance. She gives courage to those who cannot flee, strength to those who must hide, and memory to those told to forget. Though her faithful raise no banners, they kneel before no conqueror, for as long as Nakhurta is honoured, the soul of Harshandatt and her people cannot be truly conquered."
