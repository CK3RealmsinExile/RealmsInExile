 harshandatt_religion: "Harshandattian" 
 harshandatt_religion_adj: "Harshandattan"
 harshandatt_religion_desc: "Dualistic in nature, religious practice in Harshandatt centres around two conflicting sets of gods, the light pantheon of Anhûr and the dark pantheon of Sâdeh. Through their blessing, the Nhazadh receives a mandate to rule as a god-king among men."
 harshandatt_religion_adherent: "Harshandattan"
 harshandatt_religion_adherent_plural: "Harshandattans"
 
 faith_nhazadh: "Mandate of the Nhazadh"
 faith_nhazadh_adj: "Nhazadhan"
 faith_nhazadh_adherent: "Nhazadhan"
 faith_nhazadh_adherent_plural: "Nhazadhans"
 faith_nhazadh_desc: "Orthodox Harshandattian belief emphasizes the divinity of the Nhazadh above all other aspects of practice. The Nhazadh is not simply a king blessed by the gods, but a fully-fledged living god himself, and his every word is divine law.\n\nThe Nhazadh is understood to be the incarnate divine son of Saath, his father either Anhûr or his brother Sâdeh, sent to rule over the faithful of mankind."

 faith_sadeh: "Pantheon of Sâdeh"
 faith_sadeh_adj: "Sâdehan"
 faith_sadeh_adherent: "Sâdehan"
 faith_sadeh_adherent_plural: "Sâdehans"
 faith_sadeh_desc: "Worship of the dark pantheon of Sâdeh first took hold in Harshandatt in the aftermath of the collapse of the Old Kingdom in the Second Age, in no small part due to the memory of the Nazgûl Khôrahil's all too recent assaults. Appealing to the dark gods, many sought to claim the title of Nhazadh for themselves, through the treachery of Sâdeh, the trickery of Kyrdeahtu his messenger, the insidious darkness of Lyayun, the foam-filled rage of Telear, or the wicked sorcery of the storm god Senêd. Time and again the dark pantheon reared it's ugly head in Harshandatt, ushering in the end of many a kingdom."

 faith_saath: "Sons of Saath the Sun"
 faith_saath_adj: "Saathan"
 faith_saath_adherent: "Saathan"
 faith_saath_adherent_plural: "Saathans"
 faith_saath_desc: "The Nhazadhs of the Mejhanian Kingdom would seek to reconcile the faiths of Harshandatt with that of imperial Khy. By associating the goddess Saath's dominion over the seasons with the light of the sun, they would reason that she was, in fact one and the same with Arien-Âzie, whom the Khyans held so dear. Importantly, this association would not reduce the legitimacy of the divine rule of the Nhazadh over Harshandatt, since it was Saath that the Nhazadh had always claimed divine descent from, even in the periods of Sâdeh's dominance."

 faith_anhur: "Cult of Anhûr"
 faith_anhur_adj: "Anhûran"
 faith_anhur_adherent: "Anhûran"
 faith_anhur_adherent_plural: "Anhûrans"
 faith_anhur_desc: "A movement seeking to reconcile the disparate beliefs of Harshandatt and Sîrayn, the Cult of Anhûr does away with the divinity of the Nhazadh in favour of the salvationist theology of Sîrayn. Popularised among the disgrunteled Núara peasantry, distanced a certain degree from ancient Muranian custom, the monolatrous cultic veneration of Anhûr nonetheless continued to hold dear the classical scriptural corpus of Harshandatt, no less correct than the Tarat Barzain of Sîrayn, provided it could be interpreted suitably metaphorically. This heresy of course outraged the Nhazadh, which only further served to endear it to those who would live free of the reign of a self-appointed god among Men."

 faith_harackt: "Guardians of the Tombs"
 faith_harackt_adj: "Haracktish"
 faith_harackt_adherent: "Tomb-keeper"
 faith_harackt_adherent_plural: "Tomb-keepers"
 faith_harackt_desc: "Among the disinfranched Muranians of Harshandatt, a strange belief has developed in the hills. Founded by Harackt the Sage durring Mejhanian Kingdom, the Guardians of the Tombs hold fast to the ancient gravs of their forefathers, guarding their treasures and defending their secrets. The Tomb-keepers believe that someday to come thier ancient kings shall be reborn among the faithful, and once again lead their people to greatness. Until that day the duty of the Tomb-keepers is to watch and wait, hoping that soon their hope shall be fufil and their nation restored."

 faith_nuar: "Núarism"
 faith_nuar_adj: "Núarite"
 faith_nuar_adherent: "Listener"
 faith_nuar_adherent_plural: "Listeners"
 faith_nuar_desc: "All people of Harshandatt revere the Núar river, for it brings life and plenty. Among some however, this devotion goes even further. As the traditional pantheons are Harshandatt failed and the land once again divided in strife, the folk of the Núar found solace in the river, and it took first place in their hearts. To the Listeners, the river is creator and dearest friend, a comfort and refuge against the evils of the day. The river hears their pleas, and to its favoured returns wisdom and saftey. They hold that the river was first in the world, and from it flow all things, and to it will return all things, the river enduring through all troubles.
