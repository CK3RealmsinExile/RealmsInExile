At the feet of the [valargods|E] they learned the divine truth of the world and the [ainulindale|E]. They respect and revere the [powersgods|E], and invoke them to aid them, but they do not worship them - worship is reserved for [erutheone|El] alone, and His name is deemed too sacred for all but the most of important vows."

From him were born the [ainurgods|E], and the Ainur by the conduction of Ilúvatar wrought a [greatsong|E]. But [melkorcharacter|E], mightiest of the Ainur, sought to make the song his own and usurp Ilúvatar and so discord entered it, the root of all the worlds ills. At last, when they were finished, Ilúvatar showed the Ainur a vision of what their song had made, before speaking one word - Eä - be. And so, the world was. \n\nSome of the Ainur decided to descend into Arda and dwell therein, and the mightiest of these were the [valargods|E]. But in time, out of pride and jealousy Melkor too followed, and war was made between the powers ere the Children awoke. At long last, the labours of the Ainur completed, the Children of Ilúvatar awoke to a world broken from what it was, but ready for their habitation."

Enriched in their knowledge by long dealings with their Amanyar kin and the [maiagod|E] [meliancharacter|E], the Lómëquendi are remarkably like the [caliquendielves|E] in their religious customs. However, they still maintain their own distinct traditions, such as a greater tendency to perform rites and ceremonies of passage - a hunt might be dedicated to [oromecharactershort|E] or a harvest to [yavannacharactershort|E], on a more formal, ritualistic level than the informal invocations and thanks offered by the Calaquendi."

 faith_moriquendi_desc:0 "[moriquendielves|E] is a term given by the [caliquendielves|E] to those that refused to leave [cuivienen|E] after the summons of the [valargods|E]. The rites and ways of the [moriquendielves|E] are varied and many, often shifting based on time and tribe. As a result, they are sometimes viewed as 'unenlightened' by their higher kin in the [westaman|E], their knowledge of the [powersgods|E] based in scraps of ancient half-remembered memory of a scant few encounters. Yet they too revere the Powers and [erutheone|El] in their own ways, and even if they do not always have the same insight and high truth of the Calaquendi, the purity of their worship cannot be denied."

During that long march, they beheld but one of the [powersgods|E] - [tauroncharacter|E], the Great Rider, the Huntsman. In his viligance he guarded them, and spoke with them, guiding them on their [greatjourney|E] westward. \n\nThus, although they knew of all the Powers, Tauron held a special place of favor and adoration among the Nandor, perhaps only rivaled by Elbereth, the star-kindler.\n\nIn their spiritual life, the Nandor developed traditions of sacred hunts and festivals, mirroring the hunts of Tauron when the world was young."

It translates to 'Anointed Dwelling', the world of [ardaconcept|E], which the Ainur made in the [greatsong|E] under the conduction of [eruiluvatar|E]."
