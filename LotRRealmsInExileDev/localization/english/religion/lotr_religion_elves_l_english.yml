 elven_religion_desc: "The [elves|E] generally do not have temples or clergy, but have a more wholistic and constant form of worship, invoking the [valargods|E] to aid them. They speak the name of [erutheone|El] very rarely, deeming it too sacred for all but the most important of purposes."

 faith_eldar_adherent: "Elda"
 faith_eldar_adherent_plural: "Eldar"
 faith_eldar_desc: "The faith of the [eldar|E] ([quenya|E]: Eldavaitalë) is a solemn one, without temples or ostentation. At the feet of the [valargods|E] they learned the divine truth of the world and the [ainulindale|E]. They respect and revere the [powersgods|E], and invoke them to aid them, but they do not worship them - worship is reserved for [erutheone|El] alone, and His name is deemed too sacred for all but the most of important vows."

 faith_arimaite_creed_desc: "#TOLKIENQUOTE "In Cuiviénen sweet ran the waters under unclouded stars, and wide lands lay about, where a free people might walk. There they lie still and await us who in our folly forsook them."#!\n\nThough not truly a faith, the 'Arimaitëlië Creed' as it was labelled by some later scholars represented a certain strain in Noldor, and particularly exilic Noldor, thought. It is named because of the philosophy of its practitioners - that by their skill, greatest of all the Children of Eru, the world shall be enriched and made blissful, and they shall be truly free.\n\nThese Elves hold that while the Valar may rule Aman, Middle-earth is the birthright of the Eldar. It is the lands in which they awoke and to which [eru|E] appointed them mastery, and where they might make realms truly their own. The Eldar must not hide away in Valinor, their purpose unfulfilled. They must build realms in Middle-earth, restoring it from its ruin and enriching it to greater heights by their knowledge. By their hands, all of Middle-earth might yet be made as fair as Valinor.\n\nSuch Elves will abide the lordship of none but their own, and bristle at any notion of the Eldar's destiny in their homelands as being doomed to fade. They view such speech as a type of despair and resignation, which must be countered by continuing on despite setbacks. Stern they may seem to other races, for they are very proud, yet they are not unreasonable, nor cruel. Just most certain in the rightness of their mission."

 faith_nandorin: "Daetha Tauron"
 faith_nandorin_adj: "Daetha Tauron"
 faith_nandorin_adherent: "Tauronist"
 faith_nandorin_adherent_plural: "Tauronists"
 faith_nandorin_desc: "Though they never completed the [greatjourney|E], the Nandorin [elves|E] of [greenwoodshort|E], [lorien|E], and the [anduinvale|E] embarked upon it. During that long march, they beheld but one of the [powersgods|E] - [tauroncharacter|E], the Great Rider, the Huntsman. In his vigilance he guarded them, and spoke with them, guiding them on their [greatjourney|E] westward. \n\nThus, although they knew of all the Powers, Tauron held a special place of favor and adoration among the Nandor, perhaps only rivaled by Elbereth, the star-kindler.\n\nIn their spiritual life, the Nandor developed traditions of sacred hunts and festivals, mirroring the hunts of Tauron when the world was young."

 faith_moriquendi_desc: "The [moriquendielves|E] are those Elves who remained in the darkness of Middle Earth, shunning the light of [valinor|E] for peace under the stars. Refusing the summons of the [valargods|E] to leave [cuivienen|E], they do not revere the [ainurgods|E] in the same way as the [caliquendielves|E], instead turning their devotion mostly to [iluvatar|E].\n\nGenerally, they are not outwardly religious, with little form of sacrament or prayers, simply partaking gratefully in the creation of Ilúvatar, through which he is revealed to them rather than by teaching or creed."

 faith_feanturi_desc: "This faith reveres the [Glossary('Fëanturi','feanturi_gloss')] above all — [mandoscharacter|E], [loriencharacter|E], and their sister [niennacharacter|E]. Occasionally the spouses of Mandos and Lórien, [vairecharacter|E] and [estecharacter|E] also considered Masters of the Spirit, which elevates the trinity into a pentarchy in said practice.\n\nThey are revered and respected for their influence and guidance in matters ephemeral and incorporeal; the matters of mind and spirit. To these [powersgods|E] the faithful do go, hoping to perceive the truths of that which is spiritual and attain enlightenment that cannot be found in the physical realm.\n\nThe physical form, though a gift, is not considered necessary to the faithful, and many among them consider the fading to be a gift of sorts.\n\nThe [hallsofmandos|E] are considered by the faithful to be a holy land, a safe realm of the spirit away from the rest of the physical world, including [valinor|E]."

 faith_penni_desc: "Dwelling among the lesser fae and spirits, the [penni|E] have developed a somewhat unique view of the world, known as the [Glossary('Lhinnalen','lhinnalen_gloss')]. Placing emphasis on the notion of the world as the incarnate Song, the Penni pursue enlightenment by attempting to perceive and comprehend the Music. They hold that by doing so, one might find their place in the [greatsong|E], and thus attain peace and serenity, regardless of what should happen. This simultaneously allows them both greater trust in the course of the world, as well as a sort of resignation — if the world was already writ, then why vainly struggle against it? What will be, will be — it has been decreed from the beginning, from the first stanza to the final coda."

 faith_cuind_desc: "The Athaleñi faith, cherished by the [cuind|E] [elves|E], is a serene tapestry interwoven with reverence for Eru and the esteemed Valar, with a special devotion bestowed upon Estë. In this sacred tradition, the Cuind Elves find profound spiritual fulfillment through the nurturing art of healing, striving to assuage the pains and weariness that afflict their kin and the world around them.\n\nEstë, the gentle guardian of rest and rejuvenation, holds a cherished place in the hearts of the faithful, serving as a guiding light in their quest to alleviate suffering and foster harmony. Inspired by her tranquil presence, the most sacred sites of the Cuind Elves are nestled amidst the tranquil embrace of tree-shadowed lakes, where the whispering waters echo the soothing whispers of Estë's healing touch.\n\nAmidst their verdant sanctuaries, the Cuind Elves partake in informal rites and joyous celebrations, weaving together communal festivals and solitary meditations in homage to their divine patrons. Through these rituals, they strive to cultivate a harmonious existence, endeavoring to minimize pain and conflict while nurturing the bonds of kinship and tranquility that define their noble faith."

 faith_kinnlai_tree_desc: "The vibrancy of the natural world has long inspired the Kinn-lai. They hold that the brilliance of [eruthecreator|E] can be found in the intricacies of the many systems of life, and nowhere are they more complicated or many than in the life of the jungles which dominate the Utter South. The many trees of the region, blanketing it from east to west in a dense canopy, form a living testimony, the trees remembering and passing down the tales of years. The eldest of these trees are treasured, and carefully tended to.\n\nThe loss of these elders is a tragedy, and intentionally felling one considered a grave act. Some trees must fall, that is part of the cycle of all life — but wanton destruction, of both memory and the intricate ecosystem which echoes the creator's vision, must be harshly punished."

 faith_kinnlai_martial_desc: "In ancient days, the [elves|E] were preyed upon by [morgothcharacter|E]'s servants, taken into the depths of hell itself. Yet at the end, the [powersgods|E] came forth, and by strength prevailed, placing evil in chains and freeing the elves from its shadow. The disciples remember the tales told them of [astald_maktal|E], the Valiant Warrior, whose laugh set evil to flight and strength shattered armies. Loyal friend, he delights in deeds of prowess and strength, quick to action and living for each day.\n\nThe Disciples of Astald Maktal aim to emulate their master's ways. Wrestling is viewed as a sacral activity, as well as being a common method of resolving disputes. Games and other contests of skill and strength form ritual and cultural cornerstone both. According to legend, the pious may even wrestle with their master (though frustratingly vague on if this is in dreams, visions, or reality) or one of his elder disciples, and a unique school of unarmed combat arose from these purported duels."
