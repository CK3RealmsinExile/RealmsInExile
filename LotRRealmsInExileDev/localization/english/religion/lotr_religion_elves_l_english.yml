They respect and revere the [powersgods|E], and invoke them to aid them, but they do not worship them - worship is reserved for [erutheone|El] alone, and His name is deemed too sacred for all but the most of important vows."

From him were born the [ainurgods|E], and the Ainur by the conduction of Ilúvatar wrought a [greatsong|E]. But [melkorcharacter|E], mightiest of the Ainur, sought to make the song his own and usurp Ilúvatar and so discord entered it, the root of all the worlds ills. At last, when they were finished, Ilúvatar showed the Ainur a vision of what their song had made, before speaking one word - Eä - be. And so, the world was. \n\nSome of the Ainur decided to descend into Arda and dwell therein, and the mightiest of these were the [valargods|E]. But in time, out of pride and jealousy Melkor too followed, and war was made between the powers ere the Children awoke. At long last, the labours of the Ainur completed, the Children of Ilúvatar awoke to a world broken from what it was, but ready for their habitation."

There they lie still and await us who in our folly forsook them."#!\n\nThough not truly a faith, the 'Arimaitëlië Creed' as it was labelled by some later scholars represented a certain strain in Noldor, and particularly exilic Noldor, thought. It is named because of the philosophy of its practitioners - that by their skill, greatest of all the Children of Eru, the world shall be enriched and made blissful, and they shall be truly free.\n\nThese Elves hold that while the Valar may rule Aman, Middle-earth is the birthright of the Eldar. It is the lands in which they awoke and to which [eru|E] appointed them mastery, and where they might make realms truly their own. The Eldar must not hide away in Valinor, their purpose unfulfilled. They must build realms in Middle-earth, restoring it from its ruin and enriching it to greater heights by their knowledge. By their hands, all of Middle-earth might yet be made as fair as Valinor.\n\nSuch Elves will abide the lordship of none but their own, and bristle at any notion of the Eldar's destiny in their homelands as being doomed to fade. They view such speech as a type of despair and resignation, which must be countered by continuing on despite setbacks. Stern they may seem to other races, for they are very proud, yet they are not unreasonable, nor cruel. Just most certain in the rightness of their mission."

Enriched in their knowledge by long dealings with their Amanyar kin and the [maiagod|E] [meliancharacter|E], the Lómëquendi are remarkably like the [caliquendielves|E] in their religious customs. However, they still maintain their own distinct traditions, such as a greater tendency to perform rites and ceremonies of passage - a hunt might be dedicated to [oromecharactershort|E] or a harvest to [yavannacharactershort|E], on a more formal, ritualistic level than the informal invocations and thanks offered by the Calaquendi."

The rites and ways of the [moriquendielves|E] are varied and many, often shifting based on time and tribe. As a result, they are sometimes viewed as 'unenlightened' by their higher kin in the [westaman|E], their knowledge of the [powersgods|E] based in scraps of ancient half-remembered memory of a scant few encounters. Yet they too revere the Powers and [erutheone|El] in their own ways, and even if they do not always have the same insight and high truth of the Calaquendi, the purity of their worship cannot be denied."

During that long march, they beheld but one of the [powersgods|E] - [tauroncharacter|E], the Great Rider, the Huntsman. In his vigilance he guarded them, and spoke with them, guiding them on their [greatjourney|E] westward. \n\nThus, although they knew of all the Powers, Tauron held a special place of favor and adoration among the Nandor, perhaps only rivaled by Elbereth, the star-kindler.\n\nIn their spiritual life, the Nandor developed traditions of sacred hunts and festivals, mirroring the hunts of Tauron when the world was young."

In this sacred tradition, the Cuind elves find profound spiritual fulfillment through the nurturing art of healing, striving to assuage the pains and weariness that afflict their kin and the world around them.\n\nEstë, the gentle guardian of rest and rejuvenation, holds a cherished place in the hearts of the faithful, serving as a guiding light in their quest to alleviate suffering and foster harmony. Inspired by her tranquil presence, the most sacred sites of the Cuind elves are nestled amidst the tranquil embrace of tree-shadowed lakes, where the whispering waters echo the soothing whispers of Estë's healing touch.\n\nAmidst their verdant sanctuaries, the Cuind elves partake in informal rites and joyous celebrations, weaving together communal festivals and solitary meditations in homage to their divine patrons. Through these rituals, they strive to cultivate a harmonious existence, endeavoring to minimize pain and conflict while nurturing the bonds of kinship and tranquility that define their noble faith."

Yet at the end, the [powersgods|E] came forth, and by strength prevailed, placing evil in chains and freeing the elves from its shadow. The disciples remember the tales told them of [astald_maktal|E], the Valiant Warrior, whose laugh set evil to flight and strength shattered armies. Loyal friend, he delights in deeds of prowess and strength, quick to action and living for each day.\n\nThe Disciples of [astald_maktal|E] aim to emulate their master's ways. Wrestling is viewed as a sacral activity, as well as being a common method of resolving disputes. Games and other contests of skill and strength form ritual and cultural cornerstone both. According to legend, the pious may even wrestle with their master (though frustratingly vague on if this is in dreams, visions, or reality) or one of his elder disciples, and a unique school of unarmed combat arose from these purported duels."
