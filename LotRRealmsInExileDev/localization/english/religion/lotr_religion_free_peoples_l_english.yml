Here I will abide, and my heirs, unto the ending of the world."\n\nThus did Elendil speak upon his landfall in Middle-earth after the [akallabeth|E], and so were the Kingdoms of [gondorrealm|E] and [arnorrealm|E] borne from his seven ships and the colonies of the Faithful. In those realms alone were preserved the ancient rites and worship of [numenorrealm|E] of old, though the Great Prayers are said no longer. The reverence of [concepteruiluvatar|E] himself is the center of the spiritual life of the Dúnedain, but they do not worship through great temples and ostentatious displays - rather, the Dúnedain prioritize private contemplation of the One. \n\nIn daily life, the [valargods|E] are the ones invoked and called upon to intercede on behalf of the Faithful, and of them [ulmocharacter|E] is the most cherished." 
 #Old Edain desc: The Edain was the name given by the Elves to the noble Men of the First Age who fought alongside with the Elves in the Wars of Beleriand.\n\nEdain is normally the Sindarin word for Men (sing. adan "Man") and thus applied to all Men, though it became associated with only those who came into Beleriand during the Long Peace, the noble Three Houses who became close allies with the Elves and fought beside them against Morgoth. Other groups of Men who stayed in Eriador or the East; or entered Beleriand later in the First Age, such as the Easterlings, are not counted among the Edain."

As an island nation, and eventual maritime power, [ulmocharacter|E] was amongst the most revered of the [valargods|E] in [numenorrealm|E]. In turn, on account of both their reverence and their long friendship with the Eldar, Ulmo came to love the [numenoreans|E] and alone of the Powers spoke to them directly, particularly those belonging to the Guild of Venturers. Also known as the Uinendili, this guild's exploration of the seas and lands was at once worship and adventure in the name of the Sea-King and his [maiargods|E]. \n\nEven though [numenorrealm|E] the Blessed has been long drowned beneath the Great Sea, the old covenant is remembered still in the lands of the Exiles. Dúnedain mariners in Pelargir, Tharagrondost, Dol Amroth, and other great seaports continue to try to keep the ancient traditions of the Guild of Venturers alive."

All the great tragedies of the years past - the [downfallofnumenor|E], the Gondorian [kinstrife|E], the divide and fall of [arnorrealm|E] - they can all be tracked back to leaders weak in moral fibre and their inability to live up to the Elder King's example as a just and wise ruler. \n\nHumanity must replicate the divine order, as decreed by Eru Ilúvatar himself - did not he make Manwë Sulimo the Viceregent of Eä, and Manwë in turn appointed the line of Elendil to rule the Faithful?"

In the aftermath of the [akallabeth|E], some members of the Faithful went even farther in their alignment to the Elves, even adopting Elvish religious habits, rejecting any 'mannish' influences which they deemed to have infected that primordial truth. While such zealots are few and far between these days, the Elendili, or 'the Elf-friends', still maintain a more elvish style of faith, obvious in their preference for Sindarin and Quenya, as well as their special veneration of [vardacharacter|E] above all the other Valar."

From him were born the Ainur, and the Ainur by the conduction of Ilúvatar wrought a great song. But Melkor, mightiest of the Ainur sought to make the song his own and usurp Ilúvatar and so discord entered it, the root of all the worlds ills. At last, when they were finished, Ilúvatar showed the Ainur a vision of what their song had made, before speaking one word - Eä - be. And so the world was. \n\nSome of the Ainur decided to descend into Arda and dwell therein, and the mightiest of these were the Valar. But in time, out of pride and jealousy Melkor too followed, and war was made between the powers ere the Children awoke. At long last, the labors of the Ainur completed, the Children of Ilúvatar awoke to a world broken from what it was, but ready for their habitation."

While they have little knowledge of the Powers, they are not unaware of the truth of the One, and worship Him in their own way. They sing and write of the light of the stars or the sound of falling water, the sweetness of fruit or the luminescence of gems from deep within the earth. With music and dance most of all they rejoice in the magnificence of Eä. \n\nIf they have not the high lore of the Eldar of the Uttermost West, and their prayers are not spoken to the Powers, the One surely cannot find fault in the pure spirit of their worship."

A splinter branch of Kâthasaptha in Northern Bellakar, it sought to return the ancient faith of Numenor to its traditional morality and purity. \n\nIzindubeth is said to have received his revelations on the great mountain Urud an-Khibil after five days of meditation, hearing the voice of the One, who bid him to chastise his wayward children and guide them back to the true faith. Batan an-Izindi places extreme emphasis on the primacy of Eru alone as the true God, stressing that the Valar are his intermediaries, not Gods. This fairly militant view contrasts with Kâthasaptha, whose more tolerant and pluralistic absorption of the native Haradrim dieties is believed to have been the root origin of the split."

 faith_infinite_wisdom_desc:0 "Kâthasaptha, or 'Infinite Wisdom', refers to the syncretic faith founded by Zimrêbal, first king of Bellakar. Zimrêbal desired to unify his kingdom by bridging its two largest religious groups, the Númenórean Eruists and the native faiths of the Bellanarod. To achieve this, he identified the Haradrim Tarkarûn-i-Mâsra (the ancient sky-god) with Eru, and the other pantheon members with the Valar or Maiar. He integrated the Númenórean and Bellanarod religious calendars, and created a new fane in the style of Meneltarma upon Izindutârik, where the kings of Bellakar and later Bellazan could offer prayers in the name of the Faithful to the One. \n\nThis syncretism did not satisfy either side of the kingdom fully, with the more zealous Faithful claiming that the faith had been tainted by 'Southron Blasphemies' and the Haradrim unsatisfied by the re-elevation of an ancient, all-but-forgotten god over the goddess Ladnóca. However, this syncretism has with time become accepted and embraced by a large majority of Bellazan, though traditional Haradrim cults and Númenórean worship still persist alongside it."
