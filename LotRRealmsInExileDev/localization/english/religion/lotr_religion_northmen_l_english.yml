With time, their way of worship changed, with some influence from the [lasgalendrimelves|E]. They are known to treat nature with great reverence and see it as their sacred duty to protect the wild forests of [mirkwood|E].\n\nMore recently, many of them have started to view [radagastcharacter|E] as their spiritual leader due to his strong connection with nature, though he very rarely if ever partakes in any ceremonies."

 faith_dale_desc: "Long influenced by the neighboring [dwarves|E] of [erebor|E] and the [elves|E] of [greenwoodshort|E], the [northmen|E] of the [dale|E]-lands show the least [gondorian|E] influence of all the [northmen|E] faiths. \n\nThe faith of the Celduin and the Dalish highlands tends to primarily revolve around two [valargods|E] in particular - [aulecharacter|E] and [oromecharactershort|E], though they are known to the [dalemen|E] via the names Mahal and Tauron. Tauron the hunter and bow-master is the patron of warriors and hunters, who roam the rural lands of the Celduin. Mahal is the patron of craftsmen, tradesman, and the cities that form the heart of Celduin's prosperity. While all the [valargods|E] are revered, it is these two who are held most dear to the folk of the Celduin."

 faith_dorwinion_desc: "The faith of the folk of [dorwinion|E] is rooted in the ancient blessing their land received when three of the [entwives|E] chose to make the lower Celduin river their abode. These three, known as the Earth-maidens, where named as the emissaries of Aldena, the Earth-mother, who gives bounty of the earth. By their influence, the land of [dorwinion|E] grew prosperous and fertile, and even long after their disappearence, the folk of [dorwinion|E] remain devoted followers of their teachings of careful but bounteous cultivation of the earth. Though they know of the other [valargods|E] through the [entwives|E], [avari|E], and [dwarves|E], none are more loved more dearly and fiercely than [yavannacharactershort|E], whom they refer to as Aldena."

 faith_blue_sect_desc: "The Fiskurkyn, meaning "Kindred of the fish" in the ancient tongue of [rhovanion|E] are a marine cult that emerged when sailors, fishers and merchants around the Inland [seaofrhun|E] started to revere [ulmocharacter|E], whom they know as Neorth, as well as the Inland Sea itself, above the other [valargods|E].\n\nDeep beneath the Waves, the Lord of the Sea blesses the creatures of water and sends his scaled servants to guide and nourish man. Because of this, fish are often used for divination and minor fish deities are called upon for aid and counsel. Among the [northmen|E] faithful they are mostly known for being highly supersticious, for surely a dark fate will await those who set sail under an unfavorable omen."

 faith_rohan_yavanna_adherent_plural: "Adherents of Foldewyn"
 faith_rohan_yavanna_desc: "In the more sedentary parts of [rhovanion|E], [foldewyncharacter|E] has begun to take precedence in the mind of the people. Her maternal care for the earth and the fields wins admirers far and wide, and the farmers look to her for blessings on their crops. Great harvest festivals and fairs dot the land, the people rejoicing in the bounty of mother [foldewyncharacter|E].\n\nOrginating first in the [anduinvale|E] durring the peace of the early [secondage|E], the worship of [foldewyncharacter|E] would die out as the region became increasing dangerous and focus turned towards survival. Yet still in later years her faith would return, always ready to rise renewed like the flowers of spring, if only given fertile ground to flourish."

 faith_framling_adherent_plural: "Followers of Béma"
 faith_framling_desc: "In their long isolation, what few of the [eothed|E] remained in the upper reaches of the [anduinvale|E] by necessity became a hardened people. In the harsh north, the ancient, key figure of [bemacharacter|E] came to assimilate many of the other traditional [northmen|E] gods and understandings of the [valargods|E], moving to, if not the sole God, the only major one invoked.\n\nLoving to His people, harsh to those who would threaten them, the Horselord stands vigilant and stalwart as the guardian of the North."
