 faith_northmen_desc:0 "The ancient faith of the [northmen|E] is rooted in the pantheon of the Freas, which the [numenoreans|E] identified with the [valargods|E].

They are primarily followers of [bemacharacter|E], the Woodman name for the [valargods|E] [oromecharactershort|E]. \nLong ago, the Woodmen split from their plain-dwelling kin and settled the [greenwoodshort|E]. With time, their way of worship changed, with some influence from the [lasgalendrimelves|E]. They are known to treat nature with great reverence and see it as their sacred duty to protect the wild forests of [mirkwood|E].\n\nMore recently, many of them have started to view [radagastcharacter|E] as their spiritual leader due to his strong connection with nature, though he very rarely if ever partakes in any ceremonies."

 faith_dale_desc:0 "Long influenced by the neighboring [dwarves|E] of [erebor|E] and the [elves|E] of [greenwoodshort|E], the [northmen|E] of the [dale|E]-lands show the least [gondorian|E] influence of all the [northmen|E] faiths. \n\nThe faith of the Celduin and the Dalish highlands tends to primarily revolve around two [valargods|E] in particular - [aulecharacter|E] and [oromecharactershort|E], though they are known to the [dalemen|E] via the names Mahal and Tauron. Tauron the hunter and bow-master is the patron of warriors and hunters, who roam the rural lands of the Celduin. Mahal is the patron of craftsmen, tradesman, and the cities that form the heart of Celduin's prosperity. While all the [valargods|E] are revered, it is these two who are held most dear to the folk of the Celduin."

 faith_dorwinion_desc:0 "The faith of the folk of [dorwinion|E] is rooted in the ancient blessing their land received when three of the [entwives|E] chose to make the lower Celduin river their abode. These three, known as the Earth-maidens, where named as the emissaries of Aldena, the Earth-mother, who gives bounty of the earth. By their influence, the land of [dorwinion|E] grew prosperous and fertile, and even long after their disappearence, the folk of [dorwinion|E] remain devoted followers of their teachings of careful but bounteous cultivation of the earth. Though they know of the other [valargods|E] through the [entwives|E], [avari|E], and [dwarves|E], none are more loved more dearly and fiercely than [yavannacharactershort|E], whom they refer to as Aldena."

 faith_blue_sect_desc:0 "The Fiskurkyn, meaning "Kindred of the fish" in the ancient tongue of [rhovanion|E] are a marine cult that emerged when sailors, fishers and merchants around the Inland [seaofrhun|E] started to revere [ulmocharacter|E], whom they know as Neorth, as well as the Inland Sea itself, above the other [valargods|E].\n\nDeep beneath the Waves, the Lord of the Sea blesses the creatures of water and sends his scaled servants to guide and nourish man. Because of this, fish are often used for divination and minor fish deities are called upon for aid and counsel. Among the [northmen|E] faithful they are mostly known for being highly supersticious, for surely a dark fate will await those who set sail under an unfavorable omen."

They believe that [bemacharacter|E] leads those with his favour in great hunts unrivalled in mortal lands. The adherents of this sect are amongst the most militant of the [rohirrim|E], desiring nothing less than to prove their strength in arms and riding. Hunts, feasts, and feats of strength are common amongst the brotherhoods of these men."

Great harvest festivals and fairs dot the land, the people rejoicing in the bounty of mother earth - and mother [foldewyncharacter|E]."

 faith_framling_desc:0 "In their long isolation, what few of the [eothed|E] remained in the upper reaches of the [anduinvale|E] by necessity became a hardened people. In the harsh north, the ancient, key figure of [bemacharacter|E] came to assimilate many of the other traditional [northmen|E] gods and understandings of the [valargods|E], moving to, if not the sole God, the only major one invoked.\n\nLoving to His people, harsh to those who would threaten them, the Horselord stands vigilant and stalwart as the guardian of the North."

 ### Leofring Fae Court###
 faith_fey_court:0 "Fey Court of Foldewyn"
 faith_fey_court_adj:0 "Fey Court"
 faith_fey_court_desc:0 "Leofring veneration revolves around the king and queen of the Fey, [bemacharacter|E] and [foldewyncharacter|E]. Béma ever has been a friend of mankind and taught the Leofrings to ride and gifted them their herds. He is kindly and quick to forgiveness, though often wandering and absent as well. While Béma roams afar, his wife Foldewyn, mighty in her own right, reigns over the fey in her court of starlight.\n\nDwelling in the forest of the mist, the Leofrings believe that Foldewyn bears a fickle mood, proud, and slow to forgive the mistakes of [conceptmankind|E]. Her favour is perilous to acquire, though rich when gotten; for few come again from her forest, and not unchanged. Priestesses intercede with her fey on mankind's behalf, hoping to earn her favour and not her ire. If her ire is raised, men have been said to walk into the mist, enchanted, never to be seen again."

 faith_midde_court_desc:0 "While the majority of the Leofring faithful devote their spiritual energy to solely exalting one of the two fey courts, there are some who reject this dichotomy.\n\nInstead of seeing these Seelie and Unseelie as diametrically opposed, they view them both as inseperable reflections of human nature, both the dark and the light, one unable to exist without the presence of the other.\n\nAdherents to this worldview name themselves 'Midwalkers' and seek to tred a path of balance and compromise between the feuding tribes, with the great hope to one day see the Fey Queen and the Dark Fey reconciled and united into one 'Midde Court'."

 faith_withered_court_desc:0 "Once, the King of the Dark Fey ruled a court of twilight, rivalling that of his brother [bemacharacter|E]. His reign was solitary but fair from his halls beneath the hills. But his power was not that of his brother, and he and his people withered, and his halls, once fair and green, because a desolation. The dark fey rose again in dread visage, spiteful towards the living that thrived while they withered. \n\nNow darkness comes forth from that hill, a choking malice upon all who would dare approach it. The restless fey have turned fell and taken up twisted forms. Bony hands stretch forth to grasp the living and take our life for their own. Only through grand sacrifices can they be appeased, lest the malice of their dread king fall upon us, and our ruin come."

After its inception it quickly found a small but radical following among the surviving Dalemen. They hold a fatalistic view towards life and believe that one day the Dragons will wake again and destroy the world of man. \n\nThey have never consolidated into a substantial presence and remain a rare sight, yet many stories are told in taverns and around campfires of these red garbed and masked cultists. While the tales often revolve around evil and dark magics and rituals, the Raudurcyn are by and large a passive collective who celebrate their love of life while they can"

Its people have long be subjected to the extortion of the orc-lords of Gundabad, the meagre reaping from the hard soil, and the foreboding omnipresence of the cold. The Deathbringer stalks in every moment. He is random, capricious, and without justice, and the most his thralls may hope is that he pass them by another day. Rites and prayers serve not to invoke their deity's protection, but to defend them from his freezing gaze. \n\nOppressed by life itself, the thralls of Nefréa have turned dark and pessimistic, mixing ancient memory of Morgoth and Mandos, death and doom. They have few friends, and certainly no guarding power, else why would the Deathbringer stalk them so?"
