In the shadowed recesses of their faith, the Roani seek communion with their revered deity through the guidance of local witch doctors. These spiritual guides, wielding the knowledge of ancient rituals and the aid of hallucinogenic plants, facilitate fervent ceremonies where the faithful immerse themselves in chaotic and cacophonous rites.\n\nWithin the swirling mists of these gatherings, the Roani strive to forge a deeper connection with Ro, embracing the whispers of shadows and the mysteries of the soul. Through loud incantations and frenzied dances, they seek to strengthen the bonds that bind them to the shadow god, drawing upon his power to navigate the intricacies of existence.\n\nAmidst the fervor of their devotion, the Roani find themselves shrouded in a veil of distrust by other faiths of the [thanihazad|E] peninsula. Their singular focus on the shadow god, coupled with their unorthodox practices, sets them apart as enigmatic figures in the eyes of their neighbors, casting shadows of uncertainty upon their reputation. Consequently, when venturing beyond their homelands, the Roani often find it necessary to conceal their faith, lest they encounter prejudice or persecution from those who view their beliefs with suspicion."

Thus, they pay homage to both deities, seeking to appease Alav while basking in Ardi's nurturing embrace.\n\nWhile far less popular, a number of other minor deities are also worshipped locally, such as Kutamaji, the wild spirit of water, and Roho, the Lord of darkness and souls."

Their belief system centers around a diverse pantheon of deities, with gods such as Namu, the Great Sky Spirit, and Akwa, the Spirit of the Wilds, holding prominent positions of reverence.\n\nHowever, what sets the Cult apart is their unique veneration of the Tamska, or Great Queens, as incarnate divinities. These Great Queens are believed to be the daughters of Namu, endowed with divine essence and tasked with guiding and protecting the land and its inhabitants.\n\nThe first of these Tamska is Verjana, the first of her kind whose incarnation into human form is steeped in myth and legend. According to their oral history, Verjana's incarnation into human form was viewed to be the cause of the [downfall|E]. It is believed that her presence led to the dissolution of the [numenorean|E] influence over Mag and Tumag. In the wake of this upheaval, Verjana emerged as a unifying force, uniting the fractured lands and ascending to the throne as a divine monarch.\n\nThrough rituals and ceremonies, the Tamski pay homage to the Tamska, seeking their guidance and blessings in all aspects of life. Their faith is woven deeply into the fabric of their society, shaping their customs, traditions, and collective identity as a people united under the divine authority of the Great Queens."
