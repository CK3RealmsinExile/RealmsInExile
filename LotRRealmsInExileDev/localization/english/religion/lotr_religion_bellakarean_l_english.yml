 faith_old_bellakarean_desc:0 "With the loss of [numenor|E] and the [meneltarma|E], the spiritual foundation of the old [numenorean|E] worship fractured. In its absence, the former colonies of [middleearth|E] had to adapt and decide how to move forward. For those faithful of [bellakar|E], the answer was apparent. Their old style of worship had evidently not been sufficient - after all, did not even faithful lands suffer the wrath of the wave? Too humble, too reserved, they deemed, their places of worship few, thus allowing the people to stray and forget the nature of the divine and the world. Having already intermingled and taken influence from their [haradrim|E] kin and subjects, the Bellakari moved to further incorporate their practices, in some places establishing formal houses of worship, cared for by priests whose duty it was to to properly teach and observe the teachings of [erutheone|El] and the [valargods|E]."

 faith_path_of_wisdom_desc:0 "The Batân an-Izindi, Adûnaic for 'The Path of Wisdom', is a religion of revelation begun by Imrathôr of Narîk-Zadan, known to history as Izindubêth the Prophet. The faith emphasizes the supremacy of [eruiluvatar|E] above all living things, even the [valargods|E]. The Kôlir ([ainurgods|E]) should be invoked and remembered, but their place of subordination to [erutheone|El] remembered, so that one does not, in their fervor for the Kôlir, supplant [erutheone|El] who made them.\n\nIzindubêth is said to have received his revelations on the great mountain Urud an-Khibil, after five days of contemplation. Izindubêth in his revelation percieved that Ilúvatar's proper place and reverence was slowly being worn away by the [haradrim|E] traditions Kâthasaptha sought to integrate. Thus he sought to return to a more pure and contemplation centered way of faith, and so the Batân an-Izindi was born. Only the Kings upon Izindutârik, or the most pious of the faithful, should worship the [erutheone|El] in rite and prayer - all others must remain silent of his name in reverence, and perform rites to the Kôlir alone. Izindubêth was given leave to preach throughout all of Bellakar, and many hearkened to his message. \n\nTo this day it has maintained its simple but powerful faith, striving not to enforce Eru's word by the sword but by diligent evangelism, and in friendship with the High Kings of [bellakar|E] and the Kâthasaptha. However, when the darkness or the profane dare to encroach upon the sacred lands of the faithful, the Army of the Righteous has arisen to fight in the name of the Allfather. \n\n#TOLKIENQUOTE "The One whom the Adûnâi name Êru, whom the Tumakveh deem Infinite in Wisdom—this One has sent me to make known the Batân an-Izindi, the Path of Truth, to those who will listen."#! \n\n#QUOTEDCHARACTER - Imrathôr Izindubêth upon descending from the Urud an-Khibil"

 faith_infinite_wisdom_desc:0 "Kâthasaptha, or 'Infinite Wisdom', refers to the syncretic faith founded by [zimrebal|E], first king of [bellakar|E]. [zimrebal|E] desired to unify his kingdom by bridging its two largest religious groups, the [numenorean|E] Eruists and the native pantheon of the Bellanarûd and Bozishnarud together. To achieve this, he boldly integrated the monotheistic worship of [eru|E] with the ancient cults of the Haradrim. \n\nThe Kôlir were decreed to be the same Powers which the [adunai|E] named the [avaloigods|E]. [zimrebal|E] further claimed that the beloved moon goddess Ladnôca, which the Númenóreans equated to [vardacharactershort|E], had given him this charge, the source of his divine mandate. He integrated the Númenórean and Bellanarûd religious calendars and created a new fane in the style of [meneltarma|E] upon Izindutârik. Here the kings of Bellakar could offer prayers in the name of the Faithful to the [erutheone|El], and during the Festival of First Fruits would perform rites also for their patroness Ladnoca alongside those of [eru|E]. By this means would they honor both the heritages of their kingdom.\n\nThis syncretism did not satisfy either side of the kingdom fully, with the more zealous [faithful|E] claiming that the faith had been tainted by 'Southron Blasphemies' (particularly the worship of Ladnoca at the same time as Eru, even if but once a year), and the [haradrim|E] in turn became offended by the Numenorean's newfound denigration of their goddess Ladnóca, patroness of mankind. However, this syncretism has with time become accepted and embraced by a large majority of [bellakar|E], though traditional Haradrim cults and Númenórean worship still persist alongside it."

The [tumakveh|E] may present prayers upon Izindutârik for the [faithfulshort|E] of [bellakar|E], but each member of the faithful has that right as well. [erutheone|E] listens to all his children, not merely those bearing crowns of gold on high peaks."
