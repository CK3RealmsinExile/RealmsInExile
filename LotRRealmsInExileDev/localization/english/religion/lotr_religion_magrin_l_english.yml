 faith_namur_desc:0 "Of old, the Great Sky Spirit Namur has been reveared by the people of Mag and Tumag, he who brought [men|E] to the world and gifted them with life.\n\nDivine judge and arbitrator, his devoted monks have long served as law-keepers and dispute resolvers in their communities.

 faith_audaj_desc:0 "Lord of the Wilds, Audaj is brother of Namur Sky-King, and maker of the wild beasts of the world. A hunter without peer, one must do him homage if they wish to succeed in any martial deed, be it hunt or war. He is more dangerous than his brother, for he does not love humanity as Namur does. Thus, the Wild must be respected, and [men|E] not overstep.\n\nThe worshippers of Audaj do not tend to erect the great temples of Namur or the other gods, favoring groves and open-air sacrifice. The more radical sects of his cult practice open-air corpse exposure, to allow humans to return to the cycle of nature, feeding the world."

 faith_tamska_veryana_desc:0 "Originally implemented by the first [tamska|E] Veryana, what sets the Ânji Tamskul ("Tamska System") apart is their unique veneration of the Tamska, or Great Queens, as incarnate divinities. These Great Queens are believed to be the daughters of Namur, endowed with divine essence and tasked with guiding and protecting the land and its inhabitants.\n\nThe first [tamska|E] is Veryana, whose incarnation into human form is steeped in myth and legend. According to their oral history, Veryana's incarnation into human form was viewed to be the cause of the [downfall|E]. It is believed that her presence led to the dissolution of the [numenorean|E] influence over Mag and Tumag. In the wake of this upheaval, Veryana emerged as a unifying force, uniting the fractured lands and ascending to the throne as a divine monarch.\n\nThrough rituals and ceremonies, the Tamski pay homage to the Tamska, seeking their guidance and blessings in all aspects of life. Their faith is woven deeply into the fabric of their society, shaping their customs, traditions, and collective identity as a people united under the divine authority of the Great Queens."
