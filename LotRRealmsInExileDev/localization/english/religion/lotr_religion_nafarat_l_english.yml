Though he has long been absent, the Cult of Zigûr has endured, melding with the memory of the legendary Golden King into a mythos of a terrifying god-king, who demands tribute in blood and treasure for his temples and halls.\n\nIn spite of this, the people of Kanrâ also retain belief in a mythopoeic, great bird of the Kanrâ mountains, an ancient sign of protection and safety. It is said to be a guardian and guide to their forefathers of old."
