Though he has long been absent, the cult of Zigûr has endured, melding with the memory of the legendary Golden-King into a mythos of a terrifying God-King, who demands tribute in blood and treasure for his temples and halls.\n\nIn spite of this, the people of Kanrâ also retain belief in a mythopoeic, great bird of the Kanrâ mountains, an ancient sign of protection and safety. It is said to be a guardian and guide to their forefathers of old."

There the elders gathered, and declared that it was a sign, that this was to be their home. \n\nEven as the jungles of Harad turned to barren waste, and the river changed its course, still the faithful held true, though their kin made the arduous journey south over the mountains. \n\nPersistence, determination, drive - these are the assets which the gods praise and prize above all others."
