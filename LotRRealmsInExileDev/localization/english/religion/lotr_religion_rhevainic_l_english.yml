 rhevain_religion: "Rhevainic"
 rhevain_religion_adj: "Rhevainic"
 rhevain_religion_desc: "The Rhevain are the [northmen|E] who have not fully absorbed the religious traditions and knowledge of the [dwarves|E], [elves|E], or [faithful|E]. They remain a more superstitous and simplistic culture, often believing in malevolent spirits and being wary of Elves, but are hardy and true."

 ### Leofring Fae Court###
 faith_fey_court: "Fey Court of Foldewyn"
 faith_fey_court_adj: "Fey Court"
 faith_fey_court_adherent: "Aftercomer" #Corrupted idea from the elvish term
 faith_fey_court_adherent_plural: "Aftercomers"
 faith_fey_court_old: "Old Fey Court"
 faith_fey_court_old_adj: "Old Fey Court"
 faith_fey_court_old_adherent: "Old Aftercomer"
 faith_fey_court_old_adherent_plural: "Old Aftercomers"
 faith_fey_court_desc: "Leofring veneration revolves around the king and queen of the Fey, [bemacharacter|E] and [foldewyncharacter|E]. Béma ever has been a friend of mankind and taught the Leofrings to ride and gifted them their herds. He is kindly and quick to forgiveness, though often wandering and absent as well. While Béma roams afar, his wife Foldewyn, mighty in her own right, reigns over the fey in her court of starlight.\n\nDwelling in the forest of the mist, the Leofrings believe that Foldewyn bears a fickle mood, proud, and slow to forgive the mistakes of [conceptmankind|E]. Her favour is perilous to acquire, though rich when gotten; for few come again from her forest, and not unchanged. Priestesses intercede with her fey on mankind's behalf, hoping to earn her favour and not her ire. If her ire is raised, men have been said to walk into the mist, enchanted, never to be seen again."

 faith_midde_court_old_adherent: "Old Waywalkers"
 faith_midde_court_old_adherent_plural: "Old Waywalkers"
 faith_midde_court_desc: "While the majority of the Leofring faithful devote their spiritual energy to solely exalting one of the two fey courts, there are some who reject this dichotomy.\n\nInstead of seeing these Seelie and Unseelie as diametrically opposed, they view them both as inseperable reflections of human nature, both the dark and the light, one unable to exist without the presence of the other.\n\nAdherents to this worldview name themselves 'Midwalkers' and seek to tred a path of balance and compromise between the feuding tribes, with the great hope to one day see the Fey Queen and the Dark Fey reconciled and united into one 'Midde Court'."

 faith_withered_court: "The Withered Court"
 faith_withered_court_adj: "Withered Court"

 faith_withered_court_old_adherent: "Old Shadow"
 faith_withered_court_old_adherent_plural: "Old Shadows"
 faith_withered_court_desc: "Once, the King of the Dark Fey ruled a court of twilight, rivalling that of his brother [bemacharacter|E]. His reign was solitary but fair from his halls beneath the hills. But his power was not that of his brother, and he and his people withered, and his halls, once fair and green, because a desolation. The dark fey rose again in dread visage, spiteful towards the living that thrived while they withered. \n\nNow darkness comes forth from that hill, a choking malice upon all who would dare approach it. The restless fey have turned fell and taken up twisted forms. Bony hands stretch forth to grasp the living and take our life for their own. Only through grand sacrifices can they be appeased, lest the malice of their dread king fall upon us, and our ruin come."

 faith_red_sect_adj: "Red Sect"
 faith_red_sect_adherent: "Readcyn"
 faith_red_sect_adherent_plural: "Readcyn"
 faith_red_sect_desc: "The Raudurcyn ('Red Sect') are an apocalyptic Rhovanian cult that emerged after the War of the Dwarves and Dragons. After its inception it quickly found a small but radical following among the surviving Dalemen. They hold a fatalistic view towards life and believe that one day the Dragons will wake again and destroy the world of man. \n\nThey have never consolidated into a substantial presence and remain a rare sight, yet many stories are told in taverns and around campfires of these red garbed and masked cultists. While the tales often revolve around evil and dark magics and rituals, the Raudurcyn are by and large a passive collective who celebrate their love of life while they can"

 faith_nefrea: "The Presence of Nefréa"
 faith_nefrea_adj: "Nefréan"
 faith_nefrea_adherent: "Thrall"
 faith_nefrea_adherent_plural: "Thralls"
 faith_nefrea_desc: "Life in the North is bitter and cold. Its people have long been subjected to the extortion of the orc-lords of Gundabad, the meagre reaping from the hard soil, and the foreboding omnipresence of the cold. The Deathbringer stalks in every moment. He is random, capricious, and without justice, and the most his thralls may hope is that he pass them by another day. Rites and prayers serve not to invoke their deity's protection, but to defend them from his freezing gaze. \n\nOppressed by life itself, the thralls of Nefréa have turned dark and pessimistic, mixing ancient memory of Morgoth and Mandos, death and doom. They have few friends, and certainly no guarding power, else why would the Deathbringer stalk them so?"
