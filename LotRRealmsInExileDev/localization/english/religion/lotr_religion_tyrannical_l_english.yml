And it is [sarumancharacter|E] who shall order this new age to peace and prosperity. He alone who possesses the wisdom to order the world. \n\nThe Cult of the White Hand is a cult of personality which emphasizes the inability for regular rulers to properly order the lives of themselves or their people. They require a guide, and as greatest of the Wise, that role rightfully belongs to Saruman, mightiest of the [istariconcept|E].\n\nThe believers of the White Hand are a diverse mix of Uruk-Hai and [conceptracemen|E], who are united in their goal to bring all of [middleearth|E] under Saruman's dominion. They can be easily recognized through the often crudely painted Symbol of the White Hand on their shields and armor. The most devout and zealous have it tattooed permanently on their forehead, chest or back. \nThe exact beliefs held by Followers of the White Hand vary greatly among the peoples. Many only follow it pragmatically and see Saruman as a weak imitation of the true Dark Lord, but there are some who truly believe that the White Hand will bring salvation to all."

The faithful believe that the Balrog's judgement was due to the indolence and sloth of the old kings of [khazaddum|E].\n\nIf the faithful accept its judgement and repent, it will spare them, and bring prosperity undreamt of to the [dwarves|E]. They have but to accept its dominion and serve it faithfully..."
