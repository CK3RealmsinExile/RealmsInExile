 #A practice duel gone terribly wrong, Peter Vilberg 	
 martial_chivalry.0001.t:0 "An Unworthy Challenge"
 martial_chivalry.0001.opening:0 "At first I thought the simple footman a fool for stepping onto the training field."
 martial_chivalry.0001.hard_fight:0 "However, the battle proved more hard fought than I expected, and it gradually became clear that [duel_opponent.GetSheHe] would be unable to stop [duel_opponent.GetHerHis] wild and vicious strikes from hurting me!"
 martial_chivalry.0001.easy_fight:0 "\n\nAlthough [duel_opponent.GetTitledFirstName] seemed no threat at first, it quickly became clear that [duel_opponent.GetSheHe] would be unable to stop [duel_opponent.GetHerHis] wild and vicious strikes from hurting me!"
 martial_chivalry.0001.conclusion:0 "Disarming [duel_opponent.GetHerHim] suddenly became a matter of life and death.\n\nI tried not to show my relief when [duel_opponent.GetHerHis] sword finally hit the ground."
 martial_chivalry.0001.a:0 "I could use more people like you!"
 martial_chivalry.0001.a.tt:1 "[duel_opponent.GetTitledFirstName] will hopefully come to serve you well."
 martial_chivalry.0001.b:0 "This peasant — and my soldiers — will get a lecture on honor."
 martial_chivalry.0001.b.tt:1 "Your soldiers would also benefit from an explanation of the rights and wrongs of personal combat."
 martial_chivalry.0001.c:0 "I strike [duel_opponent.GetHerHim] down where [duel_opponent.GetSheHe] stands."
 martial_chivalry.0001.c.tt:0 "Decapitation in a single strike is a sure way of making an impression on the footmen — and the nobles — present."


 #Horse Riding Accident, by Petter Vilberg
 martial_chivalry.0002.t:0 "A Sudden Shock"
 martial_chivalry.0002.desc:0 "I have ridden, taken aim, and struck so many times I thought nothing could upset my rhythm. As I take yet another gallop down the practice range, a commotion I cannot fully see makes my horse rear up.\n\nFor an instant, momentum keeps me pinned to the back of the horse as it starts shaking. Then, as if time is flowing slow, I can feel myself becoming dislodged."
 martial_chivalry.0002.a:0 "Calm down, [ROOT.Char.Custom('RandomGirlBoy')]! Calm down!"
 martial_chivalry.0002.a_success:0 "You manage to stay on"

 martial_chivalry.0002.b:0 "I dive for stable ground — better safe than sorry!"

 martial_chivalry.0003.t:0 "In Charge"
 martial_chivalry.0003.desc:0 "I can feel myself being thrown left and right, but no motion can make me loosen my grasp on the reins and the saddle.\n\nMy commands eventually soothe the horse, and the animal is soon back to stomping eagerly on the hard-packed ground, as stable as ever."
 martial_chivalry.0003.a:0 "Such a forceful beast."
 martial_chivalry.0003.b:0 "I will take personal care to train this one."
 martial_chivalry.0003.a.tt:1 "If nothing else, the incident has taught you a little more about controlling horses."

 martial_chivalry.0004.t:0 "Unglamorous Display"
 martial_chivalry.0004.desc:1 "I am thrown to the hard-packed ground, the pain of the impact rushing through every bone in my body.\n\nThe stable boy comes running just a little too late."
 martial_chivalry.0004.a:0 "Damn animal!"

 martial_chivalry.0005.t:0 ""What a Bad Day for Horse Riding""
 martial_chivalry.0005.desc:1 "The stable boy tries help me to my feet, but I shout at him to stop.\n\nHitting the ground sent bolts of pain through my entire body, and my old wound is aching worse than when it was fresh!"
 martial_chivalry.0005.a:0 "I should not have left bed today."

 martial_chivalry.0006.t:0 "What Happened?"
 martial_chivalry.0006.desc:1 "I do not remember how I landed on the ground, I only know of stinging pain in my entire body. Unclear faces gather around, looking down at me.\n\nEverything goes dark."
 martial_chivalry.0006.a:0 "How did I end up in bed? Where is my horse?"

 martial_chivalry.0007.t:0 "My Kingdom for a Horse"
 martial_chivalry.0007.desc:0 "I thought that riding would make me feel better. That a little exertion would help me heal. As I fall through the air, the pain of my wounds leave me for a brief moment of weightlessness. It is the best I have felt for weeks.\n\nAs I smash to the ground, I no longer need to worry about the pain, or any other earthly concerns."
 martial_chivalry.0007.a:0 "What awaits beyond?"

 martial_chivalry.0010.a:0 "Me and my trusted [ROOT.Char.Custom('signature_weapon')] will not part."

 martial_chivalry.1011.desc:0 "Sweaty, tired, and in need of food; a long day of training with the troops is coming to an end.\n\nAs we search for a place to camp we spot an old and abandoned castle in the distance. [ROOT.Char.Custom('quirk_pos_personal_pp')|U], I declare, "That is where we will make our camp tonight."\n\nThe sun is setting, and with every step towards the ruin it looks more ominous.

 martial_chivalry.1012.t:0 "Searching for the Unknown"
 martial_chivalry.1012.desc:0 "Darkness, dampness, and desolation reign inside the castle, and all traces of life are gone.\n\nPeering up decaying stairs I spot what might be the remnants of lush tapestries and old paintings. Looking down spiraling steps I see only darkness reaching far down into the ground underneath the castle."
 martial_chivalry.1012.a:0 "We search the upper floors!"
 martial_chivalry.1012.a.success:1 "We find a great treasure"
 martial_chivalry.1012.a.failure:1 "We find trinkets and baubles"

 martial_chivalry.1012.b.success:1 "You face your fears"
 martial_chivalry.1012.b.failure:1 "This place scares you"

 martial_chivalry.1021.t:0 "The Chaos of Battle"
 martial_chivalry.1021.desc:1 "A sword strikes across my chest plate, an elbow slams into my helmet, a soldier easily avoids my clumsy counter... The mock battle rages around me, but I struggle to find my focus.\n\nI am tempted to let my guard down as soon as the fighting lulls, but I know the second assault is about to start."
 martial_chivalry.1021.a:0 "I will withdraw for a moment."
 martial_chivalry.1021.b:0 "Meet the assault head on!"

 martial_chivalry.2011.end.desc:0 "The crowd applauds as I lunge and their admiration makes me bold. Instead of pulling back, I attempt a new technique I have been practicing.

 martial_chivalry.2011.a:0 "Let's end it here! Well fought."

 martial_chivalry.2012.end.desc:1 "I must be tired from my previous practice, because I move sluggishly, unable to keep up with my opponent.

 martial_chivalry.2013.t:0 "Bloody Humiliation"
 martial_chivalry.2013.end.desc:0 "Through the use of a dirty trick, [challenger.GetFirstName] gains an early advantage. There is no time to object, nor do I want to act like a bellyacher. But I cannot let it go, and my frustration throws me off balance. I make an ill-advised lunge and my opponent strikes me to the ground."
 martial_chivalry.2013.a:0 "That crooked [challenger.Custom('InsultNoun')]!"
 
 martial_chivalry.2014.t:0 "Against All Odds"
 martial_chivalry.2014.desc:0 "Judging by the exclamations from the crowd, they can hardly believe their eyes as I roll away from [challenger.GetFirstNamePossessive] [challenger.Custom('signature_weapon')] and disarm [challenger.GetHerHim] in one, swift movement. I know it was a dangerous move, but sometimes you have to take great risks to achieve glorious victories."

 martial_chivalry.2015.t:0 "Public Ridicule"
 martial_chivalry.2015.desc:0 "I make a desperate last attack, but [challenger.GetFirstName] is quick. [challenger.GetSheHe|U] parries instinctively, but as my attack was unexpected, [challenger.GetSheHe] is not in full control of [challenger.GetHerHis] weapon. Paralyzing pain sears through my arm."
 martial_chivalry.2015.a:0 "Why did I do that?!"
