 martial_strategy.2001.gaixia.desc:0 "#F The scroll describes the Siege of Barad-dûr. After a fierce battle at the Black Gate, the Allied Army besieged the Dark Tower for seven years. During the long siege, Anárion died, his helmet and the skull within crushed by a rock hurled from the parapets of the Dark Tower. In the end, Sauron himself came forth in a mighty attack against the besiegers, glad in black iron, tall as a tower. The battle at last ended in a great duel where Sauron faced Gil-galad and Elendil, in which both High-Kings fell. But they fell not in vain, for at the last they took Sauron with them. From the hand of Sauron's corpse Isildur cut the One Ring, claiming it as wergild for the loss of his brother and father.#!"
 martial_strategy.2001.red_cliffs.desc:0 "#F The tome appears to speak of the War of Sauron and the Elves, beginning with the Sack of Eregion. After holding for a time, Ost-in-Edhil fell, with Sauron capturing Celebrimbor and torturing him to learn the locations of the Three Rings. Unwilling to break and reveal his masterworks, Celebrimbor was riddled with Orc arrows, and his body was made the banner of the Orc army, raised aloft against the host of Elrond to demoralize them. \n\nThe host of Sauron cut a wide swath upon Eriador, pushing even to the River Lhûn, but ultimately Sauron failed in his objectives. Khazad-dûm sealed itself against him, the survivors of Eregion and Elrond's host found refuge in Imladris, and Gil-galad held the river Lhûn. He could not crack any of these great strongholds ere the host of Númenor arrived and chased him back into the east.#!"
 martial_strategy.2001.thermopylae.desc:0 "#F These writings speak about the Battle of Unnumbered Tears or Nírnaeth Arnoediad. Also known as the Union of Maedhros, it was the brainchild of Maedhros son of Fëanor, after whom it was named. Percieving from the deeds of Beren and Luthien that Morgoth was not unassailable, Maedhros and Fingon took counsel and resolved to make one great effort to reverse the long defeat which had begun in the Dagor Bragollach. All Men, Elves, and Dwarves of Beleriand, save the Sindar of Doriath and the Noldor of Nargothrond, joined the union. \n\nFor a time the Union prevailed and cleansed Northern Beleriand, even to Dorthonion, but the betrayal of the Easterlings and the unleashing of the full might of Angband turned the battle against the Free Peoples. On the desert plains of Anfauglith, triumph turned to tragedy and victory to ash, ending in decisive victory for Morgoth, with Fingon slain and the Union broken. The bravery of Húrin and his kin permitted the remnants of the Elven-hosts to escape back to their hidden fortresses, though gravely weakened. Only Húrin survived the slaughter of these remaining men, and was brought to Angband to suffer Morgoth's cruel vengeance.#!"
 martial_strategy.2001.teutoburg_forest.desc:0 "#F Old beyond count, these weathered characters sing of the War of Wrath, when the Host of Valinor came to overthrow Morgoth once and for all. The Valar, the Maiar, the birds and the beasts and the Eldar of Valinor were united in this great undertaking. The ragged remnants of Men and Elves still free in Beleriand rose and fought with them. Ereinion Gil-galad in the south and west assembled the Falathrim, Edain, and the Noldor under his rule. East Beleriand rose beneath the tattered banners of the Seven Lords one last time, the Fëanorians aided by the Laiquendi and the Dwarves of Nogrod and Belegost. \n\nThe Valar were finally victorious when Eärendil slew Ancalagon the Black, greatest of the Dragons, and in his fall the towers of Thangorodrim were laid low. Very few of the Dragons, Balrogs, and Orcs survived its ruin. Morgoth was dragged from his bolthole in the deepest pit, his feet sliced off and his head sunk between his knees. He was cast into the Void, where it is said that he will remain until the Dagor Dagorath.#!"
