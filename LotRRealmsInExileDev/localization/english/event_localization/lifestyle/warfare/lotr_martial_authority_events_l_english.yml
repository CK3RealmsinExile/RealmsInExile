 # Deal with Deserters, by Linnéa Thimrén
 martial_authority_special.1502.desc_scuffle_lost: "Taking an elbow to the face, I go down hard in the scuffle that follows our confrontation with the deserters, but they are soon apprehended.\n\n"
 martial_authority_special.1502.desc_scuffle: "After a short scuffle, the deserting soldiers are apprehended."
 martial_authority_special.1502.desc: "Every soldier present, both loyal and not, know that punishment for this kind of betrayal can be harsh. The air is thick with anticipation and fear.\n\n"My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord]," [deserting_soldier.GetTitledFirstName] meets my gaze with tired eyes, "They are only children. We just want to go home.""
 martial_authority_special.1502.a: "The price for betrayal must be paid. Execute them all."
 martial_authority_special.1502.b: "You will be scrubbing the latrines for months."
 martial_authority_special.1502.b.tt: "The stink of the latrines does little for the soldiers' morale."
 martial_authority_special.1502.c: "Let me tell you a story about discipline, and #EMP honor#!."
 martial_authority_special.1502.c.tt:1 "Nothing you say seems to convince the soldiers of the error of their ways."
 martial_authority_special.1502.d: "An example needs to be set. No one will disobey me again."

 martial_authority_special.1503.desc_execution: "Deserters are due a single mercy; one granted by executioner's blade.\n\nBeing faced with the need to make harsh decisions has made me come to understand some of the burdens of command in a more... intimate way."
 martial_authority_special.1503.desc_latrine: "After months down in the filth, the deserters fall back in line the first chance they get.\n\nObserving the reactions of both the punished deserters as well as that of other soldiers, scared to face a similar punishment, I have come to understand the troops better."
 martial_authority_special.1503.desc_diplomacy: "Invigorated by my speech, tired from the long night, and thankful for the mercy provided, the deserters return to their [Select_CString(IsLandlessAdventurer(ROOT.Char),'tents','barracks')] with a new fire in their eyes.\n\nTo inspire loyalty in the troops in such a way has shown me that there is more to being a commander than the strength in your arm."
 martial_authority_special.1503.a.tt_execution: "[deserting_soldier.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] was executed for [deserting_soldier.GetHerHis] crimes."
 martial_authority_special.1503.a: "Finally, the whole ordeal is over."

 martial_authority_special.1504.desc_opening: "The whole situation could have turned out better.\n\n"
 martial_authority_special.1504.desc_latrine: "Even if the deserters returned to the ranks, and their comrades took the filthy lesson to heart, I feel like the problem remains. Why would they desert in the first place?\n\nI am just as confused as I was at the start of this whole affair."
 martial_authority_special.1504.desc_diplomacy:1 "I thought a rousing speech would inspire the deserting soldiers, make them work all the harder to prove themselves worthy of the mercy shown to them. However, even if they did return to the ranks, the fire had gone from their eyes.\n\nThe soldiers that were on patrol with me, on the other hand, seemed to soak up the speech like [ROOT.Char.Custom('RegionalDrink')]."
 martial_authority_special.1504.a: "At least the whole ordeal is finally over."
