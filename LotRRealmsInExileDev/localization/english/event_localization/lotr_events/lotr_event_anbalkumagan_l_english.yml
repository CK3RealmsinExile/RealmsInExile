 anbalkumagan.0100.t:0 "The Cowed King"
 anbalkumagan.0100.desc:0 "Once, An-Balkûmagân was a proud and mighty realm, greatest of the southwest colonies of Númenor, and then a mighty kingdom in its own right after Númenor's fall. But those days have long since passed, as the proud Anbalûkkhôri found themselves eclipsed by neighbouring Bellakar, and then drained by wars they could ill-afford to wage. \n\nAnd then, when it had begun to recover, the ancient Storm-King Khôrahil returned, seeking the submission of the kingdom Númenor had once ousted him from. The kings swallowed their pride and bent their necks, and thus An-Balkûmagân became the heart of the restored Thôn an-Khârlôkh, the Stormhost. \n\nBalâkhân, King of the Anbalûkkhôri, is in many ways a weak king. Raised under the regency of his mother, married to the sister of the current Storm-Marshall, while retaining the ancient rights and privileges befitting his status, he is expected to toe the line and fully support the Storm-Marshall - and thusly Khôrahil's - designs. \n\nOnly time will tell if he shall meekly follow, or if a different fate is in store for the proud Anbalûkkhôri..."

 anbalkumagan.0200.desc:0 "The Thôn an-Khârlôkh, also known as the Stormhost (on account of its master, Khôrahil the Ringwraith, once Storm-King of An-Balkûmagân), is a militarized realm with one purpose - to crush Khôrahil's foes. Though it was defeated for a time by the valiant league of Bellakar and the Rây, it has risen again in new guise now. \n\nThe Bellakar and Rây of today are not the ones of 1600. Bellakar is diminished from what it once was, and the Rây has abandoned its old alliance. \n\nSoon the heirs of Dulgu the Black, the feared general of the Stormhost's first iteration, shall fulfill what their ancestor could not - the complete destruction of Bellakar. They but await the command from their liege-lord in Mordor to begin the assault upon the defiant Tumakveh..."

 anbalkumagan.0300.t:0 "The Lone Brother"
 anbalkumagan.0300.desc:0 "Eight years. Eight years since I came here with my elder brother, Kathuphazgân, seizing this island and turning it into our seat of power. Under my brother's leadership, we went on great raids and gathered many men to our banner as we terrorized the bay for booty and plunder! \n\nYet three years ago my brother left to raid the rich realm of Felaya, and since his departure he has not returned, leaving the rule of our island realm in my hands. With my brother lost at sea, it is now in my power to decide the course upon which we shall embark and only time can tell if I will be able to live up to my brother's legacy..."
