 mtgram.0100.desc:0 "The journey is fraught with peril as my company traverses desolate [angmar|E] towards the [GetTitleByKey('c_ettenmoors').GetNameNoTier], navigating the hardships of treacherous terrain and lurking enemies alike. The fate of this undertaking hangs in the balance, hinging upon the success of my efforts against the fearsome Trolls of these moors.\n\nFinally, my company and I arrive at an entrance of what seems a Trolls' grotto, and we set out to find their leader. Perhaps I shall forge an alliance with these beasts that strengthens their dominion over the region and aids in my endeavours, or perhaps I shall face the wrath of the trolls in a clash of dark powers?\n\nI look to my fellow companions, who are waiting for my command..."

 mtgram.0200.t:0 "The Rangers: Breaking Through"
 mtgram.0200.desc:0 "The [dunedain|E] Rangers have patrolled these lands for centuries, a wall against any would-be orc raiders. No longer. \n\nAt last, we have broken through their defenses, and brought their chieftains low. There are too few, now, to prevent us entry into the west. Before us lies a wide green country, ripe for the picking."
 mtgram.0200.a:0 "Loot and plunder!"

 mtgram.0250.t:0 "Gram: Order Restored"
 mtgram.0250.desc:0 "When word first came of Golfimbul's death, there was a moment of quiet shock. Our greatest captain, gone, and with him the entire fighting force of Mount Gram. Only the weakest and most pitiful had stayed behind- slaves, cripples, outlaws, and wretches- kept in line by a measly garrison, easily overthrown. When the shock faded, the halls were quiet no more.\n\nEach of us, once weak, shared an impossible dream; our own whip commanding the hosts of Mount Gram. It started with a few well-placed knives in dark alleys, but before long the killing spread into the open. Rival gangs butchered each other in the street, a new warlord arising every hour. For a time it seemed that there would be no victor, that the bloodshed would consume the mountain entirely, until none remained, but this was not to be. By strength of arm, and sharpness of wit, I have outpaced all of my rivals, and brought Mount Gram to heel."
 mtgram.0250.a:0 "Everything in its place."

 mtgram.0300.t:0 "Greenfields, Avenged"
 mtgram.0300.desc:0 "The Battle of Greenfields was the ultimate humiliation for the orcs of Mount Gram. Our captain slain, our warhost, scattered. The devastation inflicted on the battlefield echoed back to our deepest holdings, torn apart by vicious in-fighting. All of this wrought be a halfling barely tall enough to ride a horse.\n\n Oh, how they must have laughed at us, over mugs of ale and pungent pipe-weed. Well, they laugh no longer. Those we have not slain we have enslaved. Bandobras "Bullroarer" Took, killer of Golfimbul, is dead. Gram will no longer be remembered for her defeat, but for her ultimate victory."
 mtgram.0300.a:0 "Vengeance, at last."
