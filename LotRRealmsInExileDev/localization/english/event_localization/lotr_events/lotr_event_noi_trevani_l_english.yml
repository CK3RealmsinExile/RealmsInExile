noi_trevani.1000.t: "The Falling of Soft Feet"
noi_trevani.1000.desc: "It has been months since me and my people resettled the vales and gorges of the Mitheithel and Braighe Cuic. In our endeavor to reclaim our ancient homes, our sages tell tales of our past, and which of our founding tribes once called this place home, before the Iron Crown and White Tree came. They are telling tales of the Lynx, a secretive folk, known to adopt and raise lynxes as their companions while hunting, and for they beekeeping, seldom done nowadays, as they days seem to grow ever colder. Once proud hunters, nobody has seen them in generations, and all of us beleived them to have perished in the wars of the past. A commotion can be heared from outside my halls. Like a myth, i see an unknown woman before, with a few bodyguards at her side. Their symbols are not familiar to me at first, but soon i understand: these are the last remnants of a most ancient tribe. The woman introduces herself as The Lynx, so called by her tribe for she has after long managed to tame a lynx again and lead them through great hardship. She has come now before me to swear oaths of fealty and loyalty, as my efforts to reclaim our ancient homes brought peace to these wild and dangerous lands. But can I trust her? ANd is her loyalty something I truly want?"
