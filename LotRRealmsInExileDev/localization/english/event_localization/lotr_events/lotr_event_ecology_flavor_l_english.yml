 ecology.0003.a: "A larger, more dangerous cat, what could go wrong?"
 ecology.0003.b: "I am not interested at this time."

 ecology.0101.t: "Tracks in the Mud"
 ecology.0101.desc: "This morning my guards made a grim discovery: wolf tracks pressed into the mud inside the outer walls of the castle. Yet the gates were shut and the walls secure. No one knows how the beast entered, or more troubling, where it lurks now..."

A strange beast, fell and fierce, has been terrorizing the region.\n\nFarmers have vanished without a trace, children lost for days have been found as mangled corpses, and whole flocks of livestock have disappeared, leaving only bloody remains behind. Normally, settlers in the provinces can manage animal attacks on their own, but this is no ordinary predator. There are whispers of a dark spirit at work, a [werewolf|E]."
 ecology.0110.a: "A serious matter - I will deal with it, personally."
 #ecology.0110.b: "[marshal.GetName] will handle this issue."

 ecology.0111.t: "Arrival in [disaster_county.GetNameNoTier]"
 ecology.0111.desc: "When I arrive in [disaster_county.GetNameNoTier], the mood is grim. Children huddle indoors, too frightened to play in the fields, and shepherds refuse to venture out unless armed with bow and spear.

 ecology.0113.desc: "Following the locals' advice, we set camp by the forest's edge and wait for the beast to appear.\n\nWe do not wait long.\n\nHours after the camp is pitched, a wolf emerges from the trees, nose to the wind. It is large—very large for its kind—yet otherwise unremarkable.\n\nIt hardly seems this could be the [werewolf|E] whispered of by the people. Still, we came seeking a fight, and a fight has found us."
 ecology.0113.a: "Die, foul beast!"
 ecology.0113.b: "Perhaps I should rethink this."
 ecology.0113.success: "The wolf falls to your blade."
 ecology.0113.wound: "You slay the beast, but are wounded."

 ecology.0114.desc: "Following the locals' advice, we camp by the forest's edge and wait for the beast to appear.\n\nWe do not wait long.\n\nHours after setting the camp, an unearthly howl pierces the night. Soon a wolf, nearly the size of a horse, emerges from the woods. In silence it stalks toward us, eyes glowing with malice and thick drool dripping from its massive jaws.\n\nThis is the fell beast.\n\nThis is the [werewolf|E] of [disaster_county.GetNameNoTier]."
 
 ecology.0115.t: "The Beast Falls"
 ecology.0115.desc: "We managed to defeat the beast of [disaster_county.GetNameNoTier]. Bringing the carcass to the center of the village, we promptly burned it with the help of the villagers to cleanse the shadow the beast had cast. May we never again face such a terror."

 ecology.0116.t: "Tail Between Our Legs"
 ecology.0116.desc: "The beast of [disaster_county.GetNameNoTier] forced us to flee into the night. We cannot tell if we lost it on the way back to the village or if it is toying with us, but one thing is certain: this threat is far from over."

 ecology.0116.b: "Hire a professional."
 ecology.0116.c: "Head home, it will work itself out."
 
 ecology.0117.t: "Attacks Continue"
 ecology.0117.desc: "No amount of ignoring the problem in [disaster_county.GetNameNoTier] has solved anything. A beast continues to attack the population with impunity. Perhaps it is time to rethink our stance on this."
 
 ecology.0118.t: "Attacks Cease"
 ecology.0118.desc: "The attacks on [disaster_county.GetNameNoTier] did not end with a bang, but with a whimper. The interval between attacks stretched from once a night to once a week, then to once a month, and now several months have passed since the last. It is safe to say the danger has passed."
 ecology.0118.a: "Thank Goodness."

 ecology.0302.t: "Dragon Sighted"
 ecology.0302.desc: "A [dragon|E] has been sighted within our realm! The great beast flew over several villages, apparently sparing them, but alarms were raised throughout the region. We have no idea where the wyrm has gone or what it is planning."

 ecology.0303.t: "A Dragon Whelp"
 ecology.0303.desc: "Travelers have discovered a young [dragon|E] wandering near [disaster_county.GetNameNoTier]. Small but fierce, the whelp appears vulnerable yet capable of sudden violence.

According to them, the dish was extraordinarily rich, with a deeper, cleaner flavor than normal beef.
