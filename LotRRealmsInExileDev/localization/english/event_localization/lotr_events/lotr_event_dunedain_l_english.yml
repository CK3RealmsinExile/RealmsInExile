 dunedain.0100.t:0 "The Rangers of the North"
 dunedain.0100.desc:0 "Ever since the fall of Fornost and the death of Arvedui the Rangers of the North have kept a vigilant watch over the wilds of once great Arnor. We are a once proud people, made secretive and nomadic for the sake of our survival, for so long as the heir of Isildur lives, there is yet hope for the Dúnedain. \n\nElegost, son of Halbaron, brother of Halbarad and kin of the Chieftain Aragorn, you have wandered far south across the mighty Gwathlo - too far south, some say. Yet, in the lands of Dunland you see a people divided; a people long deceived by the whims and wiles of darkness. Can they be saved and united? Only your coming actions will decide."
 dunedain.0100.a:0 "We shall venture into the wilds."
 dunedain.0100.a.tt:0 "You will begin your conquest." 
 dunedain.0100.b:0 "We should return north."
 dunedain.0100.b.tt:0 "Your land will be forfeit."

 dunedain.0101.t:0 "The Uialdain"
 dunedain.0101.desc:0 "Forgotten by all but the Rangers of the North, the Uialdain have lived in the Hills of Evendim for time out of mind. Once among the last refuges of the native Eriadorim, the inhabitants of the Hills merged with the Dúnedain settlers and in time adopted Anorian identity. Yet the Uialdain retained their bucolic traditions and the preservation of songs from faroff days.\n\nSheltered by their hills a few survived the fall of Arnor, but unlike their Northern Dúnedain kin - who helped to preserve their secret existence - they fled not to the wilds but remained in their vales, largely returning to the pastoral existence practised here since the Elder Days, when the Edain pastured their flocks in Eriador, before ever they met the Eldar. \n\nSulendil is of a proud line, counting a younger son of Arvedui as the founder of his house. But his dwindling people retain only a folk memory of their enobled ancestry, and are largely uninterested in outside affairs. For the most part the 'Return of the King' is a proposition believed only by children. But the winds of change are blowing, and perhaps the time comes for the Uialdain to awaken from their long slumber..."
