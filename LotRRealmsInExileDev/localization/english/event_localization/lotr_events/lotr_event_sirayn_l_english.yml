sirayn.001.t: "Favored Overseers"
sirayn.001.desc: "My dominion over the lands of the Sîresha is all but complete. From the arid highlands of the Tûr Betark to the humid jungles of the Sára Bask, all bow and pay obeisance to Khôrahil, Fifth of the Nine. As my vision turns west, towards new fronts, I know that if I am to attain victory abroad, I must demand stability here in Sîrayn. My grasp, though terrible, extends only so far, and so I must rely on loyal servants to keep the locals in line.\n\nThe obvious choice of enforcers are the Bulgan clans of the western mountains. Their bloodthirst and fanatical devotion were instrumental in gathering Pôwa and Chennacatt under the banner of the Southern Dragon. Already, installed as overseers across Sîrayn, they terrify the peasantry and procure regular tribute. What's more, they are culturally related to the other peoples of Sîrayn, and have historic claims to lordship. They have proven their loyalty already, to bequeath your favor officially would ensure that loyalty for generations.\n\nOn the other hand, my ambitions extend beyond merely Sîrayn. To the south and west march the legions of An-Balkûmagân and Tantûrak- Black Númenóreans, once my kin, and forever devoted to the Dark Lord. Though perhaps exuberant in their methods, they excel at extracting wealth from the lesser tribes of the Utter South, and are eager volunteers for my armies. If I were to promise the Adûnâi titles from among any conquered lands in Bôzisha-Mîraz and Bellakar, they would swell both my coffers and ranks.\n\nOf course, one could forgo the use of men at all. Though orcs make for poor administrators, they are a weapon my master has made use of time and time again. To unleash the orcs of the mountains upon my realm would surely mean chaos, but when the smoke clears, a new and terrible order may yet rise."
sirayn.001.a: "The Bulgan will be rewarded for their loyalty."
sirayn.001.b: "Send word to all Adûnâi of the south- fame and fortune await in the service of Khôrahil."
sirayn.001.c: "Unleash the orcs. Let Sîrayn burn."
