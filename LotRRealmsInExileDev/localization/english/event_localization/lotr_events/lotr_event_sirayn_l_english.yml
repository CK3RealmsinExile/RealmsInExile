 sirayn.0001.t: "Favored Overseers"
 sirayn.0001.desc: "My dominion over the lands of the Sîresha is all but complete. From the arid highlands of the Tûr Betark to the humid jungles of the Sára Bask, all bow and pay obeisance to Khôrahil, Fifth of the Nine. As my vision turns west, towards new fronts, I know that if I am to attain victory abroad, I must demand stability here in Sîrayn. My grasp, though terrible, extends only so far, and so I must rely on loyal servants to keep the locals in line.\n\nThe obvious choice of enforcers are the Bulgan clans of the western mountains. Their bloodthirst and fanatical devotion were instrumental in gathering Pôwa and Chennacatt under the banner of the Southern Dragon. Already, installed as overseers across Sîrayn, they terrify the peasantry and procure regular tribute. What's more, they are culturally related to the other peoples of Sîrayn, and have historic claims to lordship. They have proven their loyalty already, to bequeath your favor officially would ensure that loyalty for generations.\n\nOn the other hand, my ambitions extend beyond merely Sîrayn. To the south and west march the legions of An-Balkûmagân and Tantûrak- Black Númenóreans, once my kin, and forever devoted to the Dark Lord. Though perhaps exuberant in their methods, they excel at extracting wealth from the lesser tribes of the Utter South, and are eager volunteers for my armies. If I were to promise the Adûnâi titles from among any conquered lands in Bôzisha-Mîraz and Bellakar, they would swell both my coffers and ranks.\n\nOf course, one could forgo the use of men at all. Though orcs make for poor administrators, they are a weapon my master has made use of time and time again. To unleash the orcs of the mountains upon my realm would surely mean chaos, but when the smoke clears, a new and terrible order may yet rise."
 sirayn.0001.a: "The Bulgan will be rewarded for their loyalty."
 sirayn.0001.b: "Send word to all Adûnâi of the south- fame and fortune await in the service of Khôrahil."
 sirayn.0001.c: "Unleash the orcs. Let Sîrayn burn."
 sirayn.0001.a.effect: "All controlled [counties|E] in [GetTitleByKey('e_sirayn').GetNameNoTier] gain [GetModifier( 'khorahil_bulgan_overseers_county_modifier' ).GetNameWithTooltip] for 50 years."
 sirayn.0001.b.effect: "All controlled [counties|E] in [GetTitleByKey('e_sirayn').GetNameNoTier] gain [GetModifier( 'khorahil_black_numenorean_overseers_county_modifier' ).GetNameWithTooltip] for 50 years."
 sirayn.0001.c.effect1: "Revoke all [counties|E] held by non-[orc|E] [vassals|E] in [GetTitleByKey('e_sirayn').GetNameNoTier] and replace them with orcs."
 sirayn.0001.c.effect2: "All revoked [counties|E] gain [GetModifier( 'orc_enslavement_free_folk_county_modifier' ).GetNameWithTooltip] for 20 years."
 sirayn.0001.c.effect3: "20% chance for revoked [counties|E] to convert to a local [orc|E] [culture|E] and [faith|E]."

 sirayn.1001.t: "Sikentr's Dream"
 sirayn.1001.desc: "All Bulgan know the story of Sikentr the Great- born heir to a humble tribe nestled in the shadow of the [yellowmountains|E], he united our people under a single banner, and gave them a purpose. As an arrow loosed from a bow, he struck down the decrepit Masra Empire, and like a mighty hammer he crushed the Nhazadh of Harshandatt.\n\nNo nation could hinder him, not Khy in the north, nor Lyneria in the south, not the cities of the east, nor the tribes of the west. It was not until his enemies conspired together that Great Sikentr, mightiest of men, finally fell. He died like his empire- sword drawn, fighting many foes at once.\n\nSince that day, the Bulgan have lived in the shadow of his glory, forced to toil under lesser lords as our heritage slowly dwindled into nothing. No longer! Today we declare Sikentr's dream realized, his ancient empire restored, and with it, the pride and glory of the Bulgan."
 sirayn.1001.a: "Glory to the Bulgan! Glory to Sikentr Tarban!"

 sirayn.1002.t: "Crossing the Pelu"
 sirayn.1002.desc: "Emboldened by his victories against the Masra Empire and Harshandatt, Sikentr turned his eyes upon the wealth of Bulchyades. He marched as far as the Pelu River in Sammar, but the might of Anarikean sea-power could not be overcome. His only son was slain in the attempt.\n\nMany long centuries have passed since that time, and there exists no force in the east that can now stand against the Bulgan. Sikentr's plans for Khy have, at last, been realized."
 sirayn.1002.a: "Ormal trembles before us"

 sirayn.1003.t: "Sikentr, Avenged"
 sirayn.1003.desc: "Sikentr's empire was at the height of its power and majesty when the vipers conspired against it. Bellakar, Ray, and An-Balkûmagân- now enemies- once stood together against Sikentr and the mighty Bulgan. They struck all at once, and even so, Sikentr held out against them! But even a lion cannot hold forever, and so his dream was dashed upon the rocks of Raishoul.\n\nToday, that dream is reborn. Ray and Tûlwang are ours, seized from the grasp of vipers."
 sirayn.1003.a: "They can resist no longer"

 sirayn.1004.t: "The Pôwa United"
 sirayn.1004.desc: "At last our people, long thralls and paupers making a meagre living, are exalted. We have spent countless generations squabbling amongst ourselves, all while under the shadow of supposed greater powers, but no longer!\n\nAll these plains, wild and free as far as the eye can see shall belong to one, unified people. The blue sky stretches onwards, and we bask in the fruit of our steadfastness."
 sirayn.1004.a: "As long as the sun shines, we shall never be slaves again."

 sirayn.1005.t: "Gold Paves My Roads" #AIGENERATED
 sirayn.1005.desc: "Trade has become the lifeblood of my realm. I have secured routes across river and ridge, built safe harbors and watched the markets swell with life. Merchants flock to my capital, their coin and goods enriching not only themselves, but my kingdom. Wealth is no longer a trickle—it is a tide. And I, its master." #AIGENERATED
 sirayn.1005.a: "Let the traders come. Their gold builds my legacy." #AIGENERATED
 
 sirayn.1600.t: "Traitors and Villains"
 sirayn.1600.desc: "I stir awake, roused by a whisper. Yóm, my faithful guide! She has been watching over me ever since I was born. And there! An assassin in my chamber, just as Yóm's providence fortold in my dream. I leap to my feet, drawing the blade I had laid next to me. Ere the would-be killer can react, I am upon him with all my fury. Soon, it is all over.\n\nI will not follow my father into an early grave, this I swear upon the silver rays of Yóm's gentle light. As I suspected, the assassin bears the symbol of my hated nemesis: a chain around his neck, with a sun-shaped pendant! It is one of my guardsmen I realize. Traitors! Traitors and villains, all around!\n\nI know who sent this man. It must have been my spiteful uncle, [uncle_arien.GetFirstName]. When my father ousted him from ruling Isra, he never forgave it. And neither shall I forgive this repeated transgression..."
 sirayn.1600.a: "I shall end him and his sun-godess once and for all."
 
 sirayn.1601.t: "The Defiance of Arien"
 sirayn.1601.desc: "As Yóm had foreseen, the worshippers of the vile Sun-goddess have risen up in unison against my righteous cause. Well, let them rise! I shall crush them nonetheless. No longer shall the oppressive sun blot out the moon's gentle light! No longer shall these interlopers from Khy impede upon what is the rightful land of our Tayee forebears!\n\nIt matters not how many they manage to sway to their false beliefs. With Yóm's words of wisdom in my ear, I am unstoppable."
 sirayn.1601.a: "My blade will drink the blood of many Arienists!"
 
 sirayn.1602.t: "Yóm's Supremacy"
 sirayn.1602.desc: "It is done. The hosts of Arien are beaten, their leaders slain or put to flight. All that remains is to send out a message to any who still dare to cling to the Sun-goddess's veneration. "Scribe! Come, pass on my words for all to hear!"\n\n"Let it be known that I, Radyani of Isra, shall no longer tolerate any in [GetTitleByKey('e_sirayn').GetNameNoTier] to follow the faith of Arien. Swear off this false goddess or be stripped of rank and titles alike. Yóm is a merciful matron, but I am not. Repent now and return to your forebear's faith, or be crushed under my heel."\n\nI breathe a sign of relief. Finally, I have brought peace, stability, and prosperity to my realm and its neighbors."
 sirayn.1602.a: "Arien has been cast out."
 sirayn.1602.a.tt: "Every Arienist [ruler|E] in [GetTitleByKey('e_sirayn').GetNameNoTier] must swear off Arien or be deposed"
 
 sirayn.1603.opening: "Follower of the false Arien,"
 sirayn.1603.desc: "I have overcome your armies and humbled you and your confederates. Once more, Yóm has proven mightier than Arien. A last choice now lies before you. Swear off this false deity and return to your forebear's faith, or I shall strip you of rank and title. Choose wisely!"
 sirayn.1603.a: "It seems it would be best to convert..."
 sirayn.1603.b: "Never! I'll go into exile if I have to..."
 
 sirayn.1604.t: "The Sword of Yóm"
 sirayn.1604.desc: "Word reaches me from the [GetTitleByKey('k_isra').GetName] that its ruler, the young [radyani.GetFirstName], has declared all-out war on all who venerate our mighty Arien, goddess of Sun and Fire!\n\nMy priests are outraged. "This affront to our deity's majesty cannot stand. Let all who follow Arien draw their swords together! We must unite to stop the maddened Radyani from crushing ever ruler in her path! To arms!" they call, nearly starting a full riot of zealots in my capital.\n\nBut would joining this war be wise? Is it too late to back out?"
 sirayn.1604.a: "Blessed Arien, my blade is yours!"
 sirayn.1604.b: "The time has come to convert."

 sirayn.1650.t: "Arien's Fall"
 sirayn.1650.desc: "I stand amidst the ruins of Zarinusha, Arien's most sacred place of worship. My followers have torn down this site, brick by brick, and laid bare its very foundations. I shall leave these naked for all to see, as a sign of my victory and of Yóm's supremacy over the prideful Arien. How deep her fall has been!\n\nWith Khy broken and Arien humbled, my quest is finished. I have avenged all those who have suffered under the Sun-Goddess's boastful yoke, first among them my father. Never again shall this oppression return! This I swear upon Yóm's silver rays of light, and upon my very life."
 sirayn.1650.desc.no_pope: "Leaderless, the surviving Arienists have been scattered to the winds. And good riddance to them!"
 sirayn.1650.desc.pope.sacrificed: "[scoped_pope.GetName] has been sacrificed in Yóm's honour on my command. His remaining followers have fled, and I am glad to be rid of them."
 sirayn.1650.desc.pope.executed: "[scoped_pope.GetName] has been cut down before my feet, whinging and crying for mercy. His remaining followers have fled, and I am glad to be rid of them."
 sirayn.1650.a: "At last, I have rid this land of Arien's deceptions."
