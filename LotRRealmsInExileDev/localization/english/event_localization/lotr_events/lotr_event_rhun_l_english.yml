 huzmargoz_event_chain.0001.a:0 "Kerkassk's will is clear. I am chosen to bring terror to the north once more"
 huzmargoz_event_chain.0001.desc:0 "My father Bountig was a lecherous fool, yet could he spare the time to mate with the correct woman, or even bring any of my sibling bastards to court? No! His father never was destined to acomplish anything. No lands, or honors of his own, yet his brother had all the opportunity. All the lands and expertise to bring us power. \n\nYet what did he do? Raised an imbecile of a man named Borthan. A man so determined in his idiotic dreams of friendship with the [dorwinrim|E], or even the acursed [dalemen|E] and [gondor|E], that he neglected to raise even a single child. While his sister fell to sickness just as my weakling uncle Askul! Borthan was elected Loke-Khan and even so, failed to bring us anything but more foes. He traded and brokered treaties with our ancestral foes, while the western lords were preparing a glorious westward campaign to drive the [northmen|E] at last from [rhovanion|E]. \n\nIf it wasn't for his mysterious death (albeit not uncommon for a man of his age), and if I was a little older, I may have done him in myself and siezed the reigns of this nonsensical country. This land where fools like the imbecilic 'entrepreneurs' of Mistrand are seriously being considered for the throne!  \n\nThat's all there is... No more forgotten branches. No hidden cousins I can bring into play. No way even to find any of my bastard siblings. I am the last Hûz. "

 huzmargoz_event_chain.0003.desc:0 "Standing at the site of Szrel-Kain, where once my family's capital of old was set. The humbled forms of the former Realm Master, his most powerful Winelords, and the patricians all kneel before me.\n\n"Oh Lord Hûz. I beg of you. Spare our peoples and our lands. Take this gold and and our pledge of servitude and we shall humbly serve you as loyal vassals. Allow us to maintain the title of Realm Master and to practice our own laws and traditions as we have in your dynasty's absence oh Golden One"\n\nI wish he would stop begging like such a worthless insect. It makes the value in his words hard to distinguish as I am distracted by imagining all the things I could do to this man... \n\nYet we do require significant funds to even lay the groundwork for a restored Szrel-Kain. What harm could allowing these fools a decade at most to feel safe? "

Their golden Igathi armor reflects the sea of Rhun as they amass at Lest, where the mighty coastal fortress of Caras Sant once proved an insurmountable obsticle to our ancestors. \n\nWe have surrounded the [dorwinrim|E], prepared multiple locations from which to launch our attack, and our own borders are all secured. The invasion has no more objections from even the most ardent moderates of Mistrand. The Realm Master must surely be nervous. They had best prepare to plead for my mercy."

 huzmargoz_event_chain.0004.desc:0 "It has been many years since my conquest of Dorwinion. I still venture down into the dankest cells of the now recovered Szrel-Kain, to inflict terribly beautiful acts upon those few prisoners who have survived until now.\n\nThis time, however, something feels off. My typical feelings of giddy anticipation have been replaced with dread as I aproach the cell doors. The wails of the prisoners begin to sound unearthly. I feel a great urge to pull away from the door, as if my whole being was desperately trying to force me to avoid the source of that otherworldly screaching \n\nWhatever lies beyond the chamber, surely the concequences will be dire. For good or for ill"

 huzmargoz_event_chain.0005.desc:0 "Walking through the door, I find myself in a most bizarre and disturbing situation. No longer within the safe confines of the dungeons of Szrel-Kain, I now stand alone within a deep and oh so dark woodland. The heavy mists veiling strange shapes all around, I can scarce hold myself together.\n\nMy eyes dart from one shadow to another, perceiving in them dark figures which I had only known from ancient legend. Are these terrible beasts the ones who slaughtered my people so long ago? Have they hid in this accursed place for an [age|E]!?\n\nKerkassk! I swear unto my dying breath that these abhorent fiends shall be destroyed. Every last one! Their forest will burn with a fire as fierce as that of your dragons' of old, and at last your servants will be free from their predations forever!\n\nCollapsing to my knees in exaustion I feel the deafening silence enclose around the very core of my being. Then, as I can feel the darkness of the forest engulfing me and my vision fades, I hear a response:\n\n"Do this and great power will be your own.""
