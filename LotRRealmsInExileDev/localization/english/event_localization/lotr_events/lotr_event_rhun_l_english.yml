 ### RHÛN FLAVOUR ###
 rhun.0010.t:0 "The Logath"
 rhun.0010.desc:0 "Since before the days of the Cruel Ones’ defeat at Dagorlad, we have ridden free in the wild, wooded vales of our northern home beneath the Iron hills, a hundred families of the entwined Logath, far away from the Dark Lands. The tapestry of our life has remained continuous through the long years, our mothers shepherd, our daughters trade.\n\nTo our south, the neighbouring Dorwinrim keep watch at the fords of the Carnen, the river of wine. In the Iron Hills are dwarves, making hard negotiations with our river clans for passage through to the markets of Dorwinion and Dale."
 # Vector "Since before the days of the Cruel Ones, we have lived in these lands. Our kin to the south have grown prosperous and fat, but for us life has remained much as it ever was - the mother lead and guide the sheep, the daughters trade, father and sons keep the hearth and the home. Such it has ever been, thus it shall continue to be. The Dwarves of the Iron Hills drive a hard bargain in order to use our rivers for trade, but from it we derive a simple, but secure, life.\n\nYet there is also word from our clanskin to the south - rumors of war, and of strife, perhaps even the Cruel Ones of old returning. Long has it been since our warriors marched to true war, but perhaps it is time..."
 rhun.0010.a:0 "The people of the vine now call for our amazonians."
 rhun.0010.b:0 "What can the short men offer us for livestock."
 rhun.0011.t:0 "The Logath"
 rhun.0011.desc:0 "Silently and listening we watch as the women of Dale build new lives for their families as they settle ever closer to our herd-lands. Merchants bring fine materials and jewels and news. We listen to the whispers of merchants, concerning the safety of home, of returning to their wives: there is trouble abroad."
 # Vector "For years now we have watched the women of Dale come to our lands, increasingly bespeckled with jewels and finery to trade, and some have even stayed in the west of our herd-lands, bringing with them their clans. This has brought us much trade, and new items which we previously only could procure through our clanskin to the south - but many of the more hotheaded young women grouse at these strange foreigners, particularly men, laying claim to what have always been our own herd-lands, swearing fealty to a man-chieftain far off. \n\nThe matriarchs thus far have dampened such angry talk, but perhaps if support was rallied..."

 rhun.0011.a:0 "The courtly women of Dale trade items of great beauty."
 rhun.0011.b:0 "Our herd-lands are our tapistry. Keep them safe."

 ### HÛZ EVENTS ###
 rhun.0012.t:0 "Last of the Szrel line"
 rhun.0012.a:0 "Impossible! I can't be the last."
 rhun.0012.desc:0 "An [age|E] of this [middleearth|E] has come and gone since the days of my family's glory. Once the Hûz were mighty and terrible. Our name synonymous with terror, we torched the tree beasts, or "[entwives|E]" of Dorwinion. Ruling from the fabled fortress-dungeon of Szrel-Kain, we spread terror all across the east and north... Yet what has become of us? \n\nAn age ended with our disgraceful defeat. That day when the vile [elves|E] and their lackeys, the so called [dunedain|E], marched on our god's very home. While my ancestors fought to the last at Kerkassk's feet, the elves used their evil magic to seal away our god. Slaughtering our people with aid from the [northmen|E]. Now we hide in obscurity. That time is over! We shall direct the Igath on a path of bloody vengeance the likes of which have never been visited upon the west. \n\nWhen did I last speak with my relatives on these matters? No.. It couldn't be. With the deaths of my father and uncle, am I all that remains of Hûz, of the line of Szrel?"
 rhun.0012.a.tt:0 "Bring me the histories. Where are the other scions of Hûz?"
 rhun.0012.b:0 "I know what needs to be done. I am not the last. I am the new dawn!"
 rhun.0012.b.tt:0 "There is so much to do and so little time. I pray to lord Kerkassk for his patience."

 rhun.0013.t:0 "The fate of house Hûz"
 rhun.0013.a:0 "Kerkassk's will is clear. I am chosen to bring terror to the north once more"
 rhun.0013.desc:0 "My father Bountig was a lecherous fool, yet could he spare the time to mate with the correct woman, or even bring any of my sibling bastards to court? No! His father never was destined to acomplish anything. No lands, or honors of his own, yet his brother had all the opportunity. All the lands and expertise to bring us power. \n\nYet what did he do? Raised an imbecile of a man named Borthan. A man so determined in his idiotic dreams of friendship with the [dorwinrim|E], or even the acursed [dalemen|E] and [gondor|E], that he neglected to raise even a single child. While his sister fell to sickness just as my weakling uncle Askul! Borthan was elected Loke-Khan and even so, failed to bring us anything but more foes. He traded and brokered treaties with our ancestral foes, while the western lords were preparing a glorious westward campaign to drive the [northmen|E] at last from [rhovanion|E]. \n\nIf it wasn't for his mysterious death (albeit not uncommon for a man of his age), and if I was a little older, I may have done him in myself and siezed the reigns of this nonsensical country. This land where fools like the imbecilic 'entrepreneurs' of Mistrand are seriously being considered for the throne!  \n\nThat's all there is... No more forgotten branches. No hidden cousins I can bring into play. No way even to find any of my bastard siblings. I am the last Hûz. "
 rhun.0013.a.tt:0 "Szreldor's second dawn is approaching."

 rhun.0015.t:0 "The Helpless Plead for Mercy"
 rhun.0015.desc:0 "Standing at the site of Szrel-Kain, where once my family's capital of old was set. The humbled forms of the former Realm Master, his most powerful Winelords, and the patricians all kneel before me.\n\n"Oh Lord Hûz. I beg of you. Spare our peoples and our lands. Take this gold and and our pledge of servitude and we shall humbly serve you as loyal vassals. Allow us to maintain the title of Realm Master and to practice our own laws and traditions as we have in your dynasty's absence oh Golden One"\n\nI wish he would stop begging like such a worthless insect. It makes the value in his words hard to distinguish as I am distracted by imagining all the things I could do to this man... \n\nYet we do require significant funds to even lay the groundwork for a restored Szrel-Kain. What harm could allowing these fools a decade at most to feel safe? "
 rhun.0015.a:0 ""Have it your way wine peddler. Have your crown and chalice back.""
 rhun.0015.b:0 ""Hahaha! You fools expected any mercy from me!? Take all their lands!""

 rhun.0015.b.tt:0 ""

 rhun.0023.t:0 "Preparations are made at last"
 rhun.0023.desc:0 "Across Usrievar, wider Medlóshûkain and beyond, word has spread. At great expense and through much effort, a new host has been raised. Their golden Igathi armor reflects the sea of Rhun as they amass at Lest, where the mighty coastal fortress of Caras Sant once proved an insurmountable obsticle to our ancestors. \n\nWe have surrounded the [dorwinrim|E], prepared multiple locations from which to launch our attack, and our own borders are all secured. The invasion has no more objections from even the most ardent moderates of Mistrand. The Realm Master must surely be nervous. They had best prepare to plead for my mercy."
 rhun.0023.a.tt:0 "I have waited long enough."
 rhun.0023.a:0 "They will beg before the end."

 rhun.0016.t:0 "A Memory of Sweet Suffering"
 rhun.0016.desc:0 "It has been many years since my conquest of Dorwinion. I still venture down into the dankest cells of the now recovered Szrel-Kain, to inflict terribly beautiful acts upon those few prisoners who have survived until now.\n\nThis time, however, something feels off. My typical feelings of giddy anticipation have been replaced with dread as I aproach the cell doors. The wails of the prisoners begin to sound unearthly. I feel a great urge to pull away from the door, as if my whole being was desperately trying to force me to avoid the source of that otherworldly screaching \n\nWhatever lies beyond the chamber, surely the concequences will be dire. For good or for ill"
 rhun.0016.a:0 "The evil spirits cannot sway me. I pledge myself to Kerkassk."
 rhun.0016.a.tt:0 "No room for weakness remains."
 rhun.0016.b:0 "I have to get out of here! This is a power beyond me."
 rhun.0016.b.tt:0 "But how do I get out!?"

 rhun.0017.t:0 "The Kug Forest of Mist's Sinister Fey Lurkers"
 rhun.0017.desc:0 "Walking through the door, I find myself in a most bizarre and disturbing situation. No longer within the safe confines of the dungeons of Szrel-Kain, I now stand alone within a deep and oh so dark woodland. The heavy mists veiling strange shapes all around, I can scarce hold myself together.\n\nMy eyes dart from one shadow to another, perceiving in them dark figures which I had only known from ancient legend. Are these terrible beasts the ones who slaughtered my people so long ago? Have they hid in this accursed place for an [age|E]!?\n\nKerkassk! I swear unto my dying breath that these abhorent fiends shall be destroyed. Every last one! Their forest will burn with a fire as fierce as that of your dragons' of old, and at last your servants will be free from their predations forever!\n\nCollapsing to my knees in exaustion I feel the deafening silence enclose around the very core of my being. Then, as I can feel the darkness of the forest engulfing me and my vision fades, I hear a response:\n\n"Do this and great power will be your own.""
 rhun.0017.a:0 "One final time. I will end Kerkassk- no, [sauroncharacter|E]'s enemies."
 rhun.0017.a.tt:0 "My life's work nears completion."

 rhun.0024.t:0 "Rhun's Star Ascendant"
 rhun.0024.desc:0 "At last my ascendance is at hand! I have regained the title \n\nI am gonna make grand dad proud."
 rhun.0024.a.tt:0 "I chose to focus on strengthening the golden realm and destroying the hated Dalemen."
 rhun.0024.a:0 "The Golden Realm Shall Encompass All." 
 rhun.0024.b.tt:0 "I chose to restore the ancient Tyranny of Szreldor and return to our age of glory from the second age." 
 rhun.0024.b:0 "Szreldor is not gone. It's memory lives on in me!"

 rhun.0026.t:0 "The funny man is dead"
 rhun.0026.desc:0 "Mr. Beard is gone and I am very happy. I may even have an evil chuckle with da bois."
 rhun.0026.a.tt:0 "Well thats that then."
 rhun.0026.a:0 "One less fool to stand in my way."
