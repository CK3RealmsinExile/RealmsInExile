 decision_nordinbad_contact_erebor_tooltip:0 "Attempt to restore relations with our rightful liege"
 decision_nordinbad_contact_erebor_desc:0 "The Grey Mountains are not a realm for the faint of heart, with all the Drakes and Goblins infesting it now. That was why most of our kin fled south to the Lonely Mountain. We however, were unwilling to leave Azan-zâram, and by our lack of material wealth, we managed to avoid the wrath of the Dragons. But now the Great Drakes are gone, and Erebor still stands while we remain alone in the Ered Mithrin. The house of Gorin has always sworn true fealty to Erebor, and with our newfound access to the surface, perhaps we can contact our long lost kin?"
 decision_nordinbad_contact_erebor_confirm:0 "Call of the Emissary"

 nordinbad.0100.title:0 "Abandoning Isolation?" 
 nordinbad.0100.desc:0 "It doesn't take long for the emissary to arrive before me and present himself. Our years of isolation it seemed were coming to an end as the hopes of Nordinbad rested on the shoulders of this emissary. It had been so long since we had any contact with our cousins in Erebor and the Iron Hills that we wonder what tales they might have for us from the Lonely Mountain./n/nStill, there are some doubts. While we have always claimed to swear fealty to the House of Durin, in practice we have not for hundreds of years now and some question whether we really should ask for help when we know that the cost will be a renewal of those Oaths. As lord of Nordinbad, the decision ultimately falls to me, and with the emissary now before me, it is time to choose."
 nordinbad.0100.a:0 "Send the Emissary"
 nordinbad.0100.b:0 "Dismiss the Emissary"
 nordinbad.0100.tt:0 "A messenger will be sent to Erebor, and we shall have to await their response."

 nordinbad.0102.title:0 "Erebor Sends Aid"
 nordinbad.0102.desc:0 "These past few weeks have had me sitting at the edge of my seat as I wait for the emissary to return from Erebor. My imagination is running wild with ideas on what could have happened to them and why they might not have returned. Each day I question if I should send another, yet each day I convince myself to just wait a little while longer./n/nAnd finally my patience is given an answer as my emissary finally returns. I can't guess the outcome of his quest by his expression, as he seemed to be worn out from his journey. But soon enough I'm given the answer. Erebor is willing to assist us in our reclamation, so long as we offer an Oath to swear fealty upon the completion of our quest. Should we accept, a small army of warriors from Erebor would immediately come to assist us with our endeavor."
 nordinbad.0102.a:0 "Then it is an Oath that we shall swear"

Each day I question if I should send another, yet each day I convince myself to just wait a little while longer./n/nAnd finally my patience is given an answer as my emissary finally returns. Though from the look on his face, I already know what he was about to say. Erebor has refused to offer us any aid, and given us their most sincere apologies. Unfortunately, their apologies won't help us restore the Ered Mithrin."

The sounds of revelry and pride fill the halls for a time, before it quiets down as the emissary from Erebor approaches the King./n/nThe emissary starts by congratulating us on our success in driving the Goblins from the mountains, but it quickly turns toward reminding me of the Oath that was made to the King Under the Mountain. I knew that this Oath would make this moment all but inevitable, and my people look to me expectantly, knowing that their honorable King would keep to the Oath sworn all those years ago. "
