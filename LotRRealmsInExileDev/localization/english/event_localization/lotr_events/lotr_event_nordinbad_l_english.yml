 decision_nordinbad_contact_erebor_desc:0 "The Grey Mountains are not a realm for the faint of heart, with all the Drakes and Goblins infesting it now. That was why most of our kin fled south to the Lonely Mountain. We however, were unwilling to leave Azan-zâram, and by our lack of material wealth, we managed to avoid the wrath of the Dragons. But now the Great Drakes are gone, and Erebor still stands while we remain alone in the Ered Mithrin. The house of Gorin has always sworn true fealty to Erebor, and with our newfound access to the surface, perhaps we can contact our long lost kin?"
