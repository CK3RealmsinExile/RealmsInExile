A little extra caution is ordinarily all that is required, and even the more inquisitive beasts can normally be deterred by the vigorous clanging of cooking pans.\n\nOne bear is different. Known as ‘Yoh-gi’ in the local dialect, he is smarter than the average bear, stalking working parties and attacking them whenever they pause for a repast. As soon as the workers have scattered he raids their baggage for supplies, stealing any food they have brought with them.\n\nThere is considerable debate in the settlement as to how to deal with the problem. The colony has employed rangers, who wish to mount an expedition against the bear. However, the settlement’s smith believes the bear can be lured into an ingenious trap of his own design, bated with a honey-laden beehive."

She rears on her hind legs and roars, but seems reluctant to charge and leave the shelter of her rocky recess. Taking this for a sign of weakness, I leap forward and plunge my spear into her chest. After a short struggle the bear collapses, twitching. With her last strength she looks into my eyes again with an expression that looks almost… pleading. Disconcerted, I step back and drop the spear.\n\nIt is then that I hear the mewling.\n\nAt the back of the cave I find the source of the noise - a tiny cub, still blind and feeble, crawls towards me.

The spiders have been busy. A dense patch of fir trees has been entirely enmeshed in a great web. Here and there the webs form funnels in which various wild inhabitants - including a once-proud stag - have been ensnared and cocooned.

They never returned. In recent days the bodies of the garrison were found cocooned in the dead branches of a great oak, and on inspection were discovered to be little more than husks, having their innards dissolved and drained by the creeping attercops.\n\nI have urgent matters to attend to at home, so if the colony is to succeed I will have to raise a fresh force to find and destroy the nest, lest the settlers meet the same fate."

To defend against this my settlers have begun work on a system of dykes and channels to protect their homes, and to drain land for agriculture.
