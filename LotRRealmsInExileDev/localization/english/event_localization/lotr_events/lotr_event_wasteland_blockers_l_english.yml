Despite the lack of comfort I find a calmness descending on me as I take in the beauty of the star-studded sky\n\nSuddeny I hear a snarl. Across from the fire I see a pair of eyes. Just as suddenly the pair are joined by two-dozen others, and I realise that we are surrounded. A cruel howl strikes our ears, and our error becomes clear - we have camped beside a wolf den!

As we approach our fear grows, for the she-wolf stands before a scrabbling pile of wolf-cubs, and her snarl and snap makes it clear that she means to defend them with all her strength and ferocity."

The settlers there have brought over many domestic dogs to their lands, who act as loyal and reliable guardians of livestock and households. However, this has had disturbing consequences. As the population of wolves diminishes, and these domestic dogs roam the lands in larger numbers, a hybrid species has started to become more common as the wolves and hounds intermix.\n\nThese ‘wolfdogs’ possess the characteristics of a wolf, but the temperament of a dog, and have started to become quite popular among the local population as pets and guardians.

A little extra caution is ordinarily all that is required, and even the more inquisitive beasts can normally be deterred by the vigorous clanging of cooking pans.\n\nOne bear is different. Known as ‘Yoh-gi’ in the local dialect, he is smarter than the average bear, stalking working parties and attacking them whenever they pause for a repast. As soon as the workers have scattered he raids their baggage for supplies, stealing any food they have brought with them.\n\nThere is considerable debate in the settlement as to how to deal with the problem. The colony has employed rangers, who wish to mount an expedition against the bear. However, the settlement’s smith believes the bear can be lured into an ingenious trap of his own design, bated with a honey-laden beehive."

To defend against this my settlers have begun work on a system of dykes and channels to protect their homes, and to drain land for agriculture.
