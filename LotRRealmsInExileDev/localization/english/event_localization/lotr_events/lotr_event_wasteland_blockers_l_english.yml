In the crepuscular light we made a camp on the edge of a copse of stout trees, and set to work starting a campfire. Despite the lack of comfort I find a calmness descending on me as I take in the beauty of the star-studded sky\n\nSuddeny I hear a snarl. Across from the fire I see a pair of eyes. Just as suddenly the pair are joined by two-dozen others, and I realise that we are surrounded. A cruel howl strikes our ears, and our error becomes clear - we have camped beside a wolf den!

As we approach our fear grows, for the she-wolf stands before a scrabbling pile of wolf-cubs, and her snarl and snap makes it clear that she means to defend them with all her strength and ferocity."

The settlers there have brought over many domestic dogs to their lands, who act as loyal and reliable guardians of livestock and households. However, this has had disturbing consequences. As the population of wolves diminishes, and these domestic dogs roam the lands in larger numbers, a hybrid species has started to become more common as the wolves and hounds intermix.\n\nThese ‘wolfdogs’ possess the characteristics of a wolf, but the temperament of a dog, and have started to become quite popular among the local population as pets and guardians.

We request your aid in destroying them once and for all, so we may sleep peacefully.”\n\nMy Steward interjects: “My lord, if the wolves have truly been driven into the hills miles away from the colony, I feel there is little need for any interference from us; the wolves will simply move on by the next winter.”"

The wolves, they say, are so numerous and terrible that merely surviving the nights is a challenge. The situation is unsustainable\n\n As my retinue and I go to return home to gather up a force to cull the wolves, I get separated from the rest of my group with only a small handful of people with me, and before long the quiet gloom of the night is shaken by the howls of what must be at least a hundred wolves.

Known as ‘Yoh-gi’ in the local dialect, he is smarter than the average bear, stalking working parties and attacking them whenever they pause for a repast. As soon as the workers have scattered he raids their baggage for supplies, stealing any food they have brought with them.\n\nThere is considerable debate in the settlement as to how to deal with the problem. The colony has employed rangers, who wish to mount an expedition against the bear. However, the settlement’s smith believes the bear can be lured into an ingenious trap of his own design, bated with a honey-laden beehive."

After a short struggle the bear collapses, twitching. With her last strength she looks into my eyes again with an expression that looks almost… pleading. Disconcerted, I step back and drop the spear.\n\nIt is then that I hear the mewling.\n\nAt the back of the cave I find the source of the noise - a tiny cub, still blind and feeble, crawls towards me.
