 druedain.0100.t: "The Heir of Zîghi"
 druedain.0100.desc: "Many years have passed since the death of the High Chieftain Zîghi and the chaos and infighting that followed. The evil Ân Zûn clan, which murdered his son and successor, Adrîm, and many leal warriors through the most vile of betrayals, was to blame for much of the damage.\n\nMany believed that clan Buri Zîghi would disappear forever, even after the Black Adder had to halt his march on Rast Vorn due to the bold attack of Pôn of the Ân Ghâwa clan. Though the ambush failed, it weakened the traitor so much that he could not continue his vendetta to wipe our clan from the face of [middleearth|E]...\n\nYet now we have done what many have thought to be impossible and retaken the realm of Zîghi, proving ourselves to be true heirs of the great warrior. A new dawn has come not just for clan Buri Zîghi but for the Beffraen people as a whole. But danger awaits in the shadows of the East, a danger that if not stopped could be the end of all of [middleearth|E]..."
 druedain.0100.a: "For the glory of the Heirs of Zîghi!"
 
 druedain.0200.t: "The Path to the East"
 druedain.0200.desc: "As the Men of the Rây close in on our borders, the decision has been made to seek out the long abandoned lands of the Yatali-Gân in faraway [GetTitleByKey('c_bru_kha').GetNameNoTier|U]. While the preparations for the long journey are being made, I realize that I still have to decide if I wish to retain a hold on my current dwellings, or leave them behind altogether. Leaving everything behind would make it easier to focus on building up our new home in the east, but if I'd be able to control both lands in the East and the West, I may be able to make them both prosper..."
 druedain.0200.a: "We leave everything behind."
 druedain.0200.a.tt: "Your [title|E]s in the Sûza-Sûmar will be lost, and you will gain a fairly developed new capital in [GetTitleByKey('c_bru_kha').GetNameNoTier|U]"
 druedain.0200.b: "Let most of my people remain here."
 druedain.0200.b.tt: "You retain your titles and gain [GetTitleByKey('c_bru_kha').GetNameNoTier|U] as a [colony|E]"
 
 druedain.0201.t: "Arrival at Bru-Kha"
 druedain.0201.desc: "The journey was long and arduous, but at last my kin and I stand before the overgrown walls of [GetTitleByKey('c_bru_kha').GetNameNoTier|U]. As we begin to unload our provisions and settle into our new dwellings, I breathe a long sigh of relief.\n\nHere, in these deep and forgotten jungles, we shall be safe from the troubles of the wider world."
 druedain.0201.a: "Peace, at last."
