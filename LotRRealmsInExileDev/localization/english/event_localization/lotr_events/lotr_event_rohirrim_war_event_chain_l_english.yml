 war_of_the_rohirrim.0100.desc:0 "Not for the first time, a messenger from Edoras stands before me, bearing news once more of the King's Council. A chance for [helm.GetName] to gather his lords and to play at being the mighty master he deems himself.\n\nYet, I am no mere vassal to be summoned like a hound. He may not choose to believe it, but in my blood flows the blood of [freawine.GetTitledFirstName], and my hold on the lands of the Adorn grows ever stronger.\n\nBut long has Helm stewed over my past refusals, and his wrath is no small thing, even for one such as I. Another refusal may push him to at last act.\n\nIf I am to go, I need not go humbly. Perhaps, the time has come to show the strength of my position and secure the succession of [wulf.GetFirstName], my one and only son."

 war_of_the_rohirrim.0101.desc.bold:0 "The climb to Meduseld is steep, but my men and I ascend with purpose. As we step into the Golden Hall, light from the torches dances upon the tapestries of kings long past, and I fix my eyes only on Helm, seated high and grim. His council falls silent at our intrusion.\n\n"[helm.GetTitledFirstName]," I call, my voice ringing out. "I see you hold your councils without me. Strange, for a lord of my standing to be excluded when you went to such lengths to call me here!" I smirk, letting the insult linger before continuing. "But perhaps this is not the only poor judgement you have shown of late."\n\nI step forward, my son [wulf.GetFirstName] standing at my side. "They say you would sell your daughter, [hera.GetFirstName], to a Gondorian noble, and against her wishes, no less. Is this how you protect your own? By making us vassals to Gondor’s whims?"\n\nI gesture grandly, spreading my arms. "I offer you a better path. Let her marry my son, Wulf. Let us heal the divisions in our land and forge a bond of strength. Or are you too proud to see sense?""
 war_of_the_rohirrim.0101.desc.calm:0 "The torches of Meduseld flicker in the evening light as I cross the threshold of the Golden Hall, my steps steady but unassuming. My men remain outside; this is a matter of words, not swords.

"It gladdens my heart to see the wisdom of [rohan|E] gathered here. Your summons honours me, though I must confess I am troubled by certain whispers that reach my ears." I pause, allowing the silence to draw taut.\n\n"It is said you seek to wed your daughter, [hera.GetFirstName], to a Gondorian noble. A noble purpose, perhaps, but does Gondor’s leash not chafe enough already? Why not heal the wounds among our own people instead? My son, [wulf.GetFirstName], would be a fine match - one that strengthens us all. Is that not what a king desires?"\n\nI take a step closer, lowering my voice just enough. "The plains are restless, my lord. Strength comes not only from swords, but from unity. Shall we seize it together, or let it slip away?""

We discuss the state of the Riddermark, but my thoughts simmer with anger as I look down at [freca.GetFirstNamePossessive] empty seat.\n\nThe doors of Meduseld burst open and Freca strides in, flanked by his son, [wulf.GetFirstName], and a contingent of his men, hushing the room. "And to think you would start without me!" He says with a smirk. "They say you would sell your daughter, [hera.GetFirstName], to a Gondorian noble. Is this how you protect your own?"\n\nFreca steps forward, raising his voice. "I offer you a better path. Let her marry my son, Wulf, to heal the divisions in our land and our people. Or are you too proud to see sense?"\n\nRage surges within me and I rise to my feet, but [frealaf.GetFirstName] lays a hand on my arm. "Uncle," he says softly, "this is a council, not a battlefield. Don't let anger cloud your judgement."\n\nI glare at Freca, fury boiling as I weigh my next move."

"It gladdens my heart to see the wisdom of [rohan|E] gathered here. Your summons honours me, my lord, though troubling whispers reach my ears."\n\nI say nothing, my eyes narrowing as I watch him press on. "They say you would wed your daughter, [hera.GetFirstName], to a Gondorian noble. A noble deed, perhaps, but does Gondor’s leash not chafe already? Would it not be wiser to heal the wounds among our own people instead? My son, [wulf.GetFirstName], would be a fine match! A bond of unity, not subjugation."\n\nThough he speaks softly, the challenge in his words is unmistakable. My fingers dig into the arms of my chair, as [frealaf.GetFirstName] lays a hand on my arm, silently urging me to stay calm."

"The marriage of your son is a trifle. You and I shall discuss it later - for now this council has matters of the moment to discuss."\n\nWhen the council at last ends, Helm rises and places his hand upon my shoulder. "The king does not permit brawls in his house, but men are freer outside. Come."\n\nThe cold evening air bites at my skin as we walk away from Meduseld. At last we stand in a dimly lit clearing, far from all others. Helm’s voice cuts through the cold. "You do not seek an alliance, Freca. You seek a throne."\n\nMy blood boils with rage. How dare he? After all my work, all my strength, to stand here accused like a common thief?\n\n"Old kings that refuse a proffered staff may fall on their knees" I snarl, stepping closer, my voice trembling with fury. The heat of his gaze meets mine, and I know he will never respect me, never see me as his equal.\n\nThe tension snaps. My fist finds his face, then his gut, but Helm does not flinch. He stands like a mountain, unmoved by my rage, and I suddenly feel smaller beneath his unyielding stare."

The braziers sputter, casting lonely shadows on the ground - for we now stand alone, barely within the worried gaze of my kin and his. [freca.GetFirstName] stands before me, his bulk casting a round shapes on the ground.\n\n"You do not seek an alliance, Freca," I say, my voice like ice. "You seek a throne."\n\nFreca’s face twists, his fists trembling at his sides. "Old kings that refuse a proffered staff may fall on their knees" he snarls, stepping closer, his voice shaking with fury. Then he snaps. His punch lands squarely on my jaw, then another to my gut.\n\nThe sound of his strikes carries in the silence, but I barely feel them. The man may have mass, but not enough to move me. I stare him down, unflinching. The fire in his eyes falters as he realises his blows have done nothing.\n\n"You talk of a staff! If Helm dislikes a crooked staff that is thrust on him, he breaks it. So!" I take a single step forward and deliver one clean, solid uppercut to his jaw."

I feel the cold bite of the ground as my head strikes something hard - a rock, sharp and unyielding.\n\nMy vision blurs, smearing torchlight and shadows into a single, dizzying haze. The roar of voices around me becomes a distant, muffled clamour, drowned beneath the ringing in my ears.\n\nWarmth spreads across my face, and I know it for what it is - blood. My blood.\n\nSuddenly, strong hands lift me, cradling me close. I hear my name, desperate and broken. "Father!" [wulf.GetFirstNamePossessive] voice carries above the noise, a cry torn from his very soul. My son’s arms hold me tight, his chest heaving with grief. I struggle to open my eyes, to see him.\n\nThere he is. Wulf, my only son. The fire in his eyes burns brighter than ever, and I feel pride, even now.

"You will pay for this, Helm! I swear it! I will kill you for what you’ve done!" His voice cracks with the weight of his rage, and a shadow envelops my heart.\n\nThis was never my intent. I struck him to humble him, not to end him. Yet I know I cannot show doubt now. The eyes of my men, my kin, and Freca’s followers are upon me. To waver would be to show weakness.\n\nI step forward, my voice cold as the wind. "You speak treason, Wulf. For this, I banish you.

I do not bask in their praise; strength is a tool, not a triumph.\n\nBut even in the quiet of the Golden Hall, my mind turns to the west.
