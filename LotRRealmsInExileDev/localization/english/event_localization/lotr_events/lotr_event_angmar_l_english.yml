 ## WITCH-KING EVENTS ##
 angmar.0001.t:0 "Lord of the Nine"
 angmar.0001.desc:0 "There is a new Power in the North - one borne from snow and steel-clad flesh, and the whispers of phantoms on turgid air. The Mountain-Orcs, ever servants to the Darkness, are baying for blood and stamping their swords. They shall serve Angmar, and his Master, the Lord of the World.\n\nThe Hillmen, long held in thrall by the Men of the West have taken hold of the East of Eriador, and they too shall serve Angmar, or else little longer shall they enjoy their plunder and new lands.\n\nTo the North, and his West, are the Balsharim, crude hut-dwellers in the ice and snow - he shall subjugate them also, and remind them who their Master is.\n\nBut his chief enemy is the Kingdom of Arnor - there squat the foul [dunedain|E], last of the remnants of a sundered lineage, the greatest foes of his Master, Sauron the Great. \n\n But the hour draws near for the Black Captain, King of Angmar. This is his hour! None shall stand before him, and none shall stand before the Lord of the Rings!"
 angmar.0001.a:0 "Curse now and die in vain!"

 angmar.1001.t:0 "The Fall of East Forodwaith"
 angmar.1001.desc:0 "NEEDS LOC After a swift campaign, the last vestiges of the Balsharim have been brought to heel. They now have been remade in the image of their kin, and will serve me long an faithfully. The lands of East Forodwaith are mine to do with as I please."
 angmar.1001.a:0 "It is now West Angmar!"
 
 angmar.0501.t:0 "Utter Insolence"
 angmar.0501.desc:0 "My spies bring me a report that at first I can hardly believe to be truthful. [hwaldar.GetName], the brazen fool of a lowly hillman chief who had ousted the last of the failing Dúnadan kings from [rhudaur|E], has now sworn fealty... to the King of [arthedain|E]. \n\nContaining my rightful anger at this betrayal, I consider my next move carefully. It is very clear that I cannot let this insolence go unpunished. Hwaldar earned his throne in no small part with the help of my influence. His rule only stands because of my support. \n\nAnd yet, he who united the squabbling tribes of Hillmen may yet prove useful, if left alive. I must decide carefully on how best to deal with this situation."
 angmar.0501.a:0 "I will not let this insolence stand. Make ready for war!"
 event_angmar_0501_a:0 "You get a claim on the [GetTitleByKey('k_rhudaur').GetName] and start an invasion against [hwaldar.GetFullName]."
 angmar.0501.b:0 "He may yet be persuaded to rethink his foolish choice."
 event_angmar_0501_b:0 "You will demand total submission from [hwaldar.GetFullName]."
 
 angmar.0502.t:0 "His Last Chance Squandered"
 angmar.0502.desc:0 "[hwaldar.GetFullName] has refused my merciful offer, spitting in my face. There is only one answer to this insolence. \n\nSound the horns of war! Angmar shall be unleashed..."
 angmar.0502.a:0 "Make ready for war!"
 host_of_angmar:0 "Angmar-host"
 
 angmar.0503.t:0 "A Wise Decision"
 angmar.0503.desc:0 "[hwaldar.GetFullName] has wisely decided to give in to my demands, and bent the knee before me. Still, I cannot let his earlier insolence go unpunished... \n\nThe [GetTitleByKey('k_rhudaur').GetName] shall be stripped from him, reducing him to a mere High Chieftain. I shall assume direct control of that wretched land, and ensure there are no more rebellions against my rule."
 angmar.0503.a:0 "Rhudaur is mine!"
 
 angmar.0504.t:0 "Rhudaur Expands"
 angmar.0504.desc:0 "My spies bring me encouraging reports from the south. [hwaldar.GetFullName], the Hillman ruler of the [GetTitleByKey('k_rhudaur').GetName], has succeeded in driving out the last remaining Dúnedain from the Angle of Mitheithel, between the rivers Bruinen and Hoarwell. \n\nHaving proven his usefulness to me, I wonder what is to be done with the so-called Chief of Chiefs, [hwaldar.GetFirstName]. I could leave him to continue his war against the Dúnedain, but he is ambitious and strong-willed. This victory might drive him to think that his alliance to [angmar|E] is no longer needed... \n\nMaybe a reminder is in order?"
 angmar.0504.a:0 "I shall demand tribute from the Chief of Chiefs."
 event_angmar_0504_a:0 "You will demand that [hwaldar.GetFullName] becomes your tributary."
 angmar.0504.b:0 "I shall leave him unfettered... for now."
 
 angmar.0505.t:0 "Tribute from Rhudaur"
 angmar.0505.desc:0 "A wise choice! [hwaldar.GetFullName] has sent an envoy, declaring his acceptance to become my tributary. \n\nHe will be of great use to me in the future. Now, I can focus on my looming war with the realms of [arthedain|E] and [cardolan|E]."
 angmar.0505.a:0 "The Iron Crown rises!"
 event_angmar_0505_a:0 "You get the [GetTitleByKey('e_angmar').GetName]"
 
 angmar.0506.t:0 "A Demand Turned Aside"
 angmar.0506.desc:0 "A messenger from [rhudaur|E] brings me the news that [hwaldar.GetFullName] has refused to become my tributary. The feckless fool! \n\nI will have to keep a close eye on the ambitious Chief of Chiefs, lest he thinks of casting off the yoke of [angmar|E] further. \n\nThere is unrest amongst those of [hwaldar.GetFirstName]'s chieftains that have begun to follow the beliefs of Angmar, and many speak of open rebellion against their Chief of Chiefs. \n\nIt would seem as if Hwaldar's punishment is already upon him..."
 angmar.0506.a:0 "Let them squabble!"
 event_angmar_0506_a:0 "The most powerful chieftains will rebel against [hwaldar.GetName]."
 
 angmar.0507.t:0 "His Greatest Failure"
 angmar.0507.desc:0 "My spies bring me frustrating reports from the south. [hwaldar.GetName], the self-styled "Chief of Chiefs", has been unsuccessful in his war against the remaining Dúnedain of [rhudaur|E]. \n\nSuch is is failure that I can no longer tolerate his lacklustre leadership. It is clear that the Hillmen of Rhudaur need to be administered more... closely. \n\nI shall make them direct vassalls of the Iron Crown, effective immediately."
 angmar.0507.a:0 "Incompetence shall never be tolerated!"
 event_angmar_0507_a:0 "The [GetTitleByKey('k_rhudaur').GetName] is destroyed, and its remaining chieftains become your direct vassals."
 
 ## MINOR CHARACTERS ##
 angmar.3001.t:0 "The Heart-ripper of Mount Gram"
 angmar.3001.desc:0 "I've got a bleeding heart in my claw. You best believe I ripped it out myself, just now. It is my way of dealing with anyone who dares to cross me. \n\nI did the same to my father and some other parts of my family. Mount Gram is mine, mine alone! It's my stronghold from where I'll ravage the lands below while the great kingdoms wage their wars, bleeding each other dry. \n\nMy boys hunger for a good ol' raid, and I'm alway ready to oblige. You'll see. And if anyone dares to try and stop me..."
 angmar.3001.a:0 "...I'll rip out their hearts!"

 angmar.3050.t:0 "An Envoy from Rhudaur"
 angmar.3050.desc:0 "What's this now? A messenger from the Hillmen south of here? I don't trust'em. \n\nFine! Let him speak, if he must. Who's this [tull.GetName] anyways? Some upstart looking for allies? \n\nBah! We do not dabble in diplomacy here! And yet... Maybe I ought to give this offer some thought... \n\nOn the other hand, I'd much enjoy ripping out this messenger's heart!"
 angmar.3050.a:0 "Go on then! He'll have his alliance."
 angmar.3050.b:0 "No! Off you go, messenger, before I lose patience."
 angmar.3050.c:0 "He dares to order ME around? I'll take his lands, and rip his heart out!"
