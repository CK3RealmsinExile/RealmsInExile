 ## WITCH-KING EVENTS ##

 angmar.1001.t: "The Fall of East Forodwaith"
 angmar.1001.desc: "NEEDS LOC After a swift campaign, the last vestiges of the Balsharim have been brought to heel. They now have been remade in the image of their kin and will serve me long and faithfully. The lands of East [forodwaith|E] are mine to do with as I please."
 angmar.1001.a: "It is now West Angmar!"
 
 angmar.0501.t: "Utter Insolence"
 angmar.0501.desc: "My spies bring me a report that at first I can hardly believe to be truthful. [hwaldar.GetName], the brazen fool of a lowly [hillman|E] chief who had ousted the last of the failing Dúnadan kings from [rhudaur|E], has now sworn fealty... to the King of [arthedain|E]. \n\nContaining my rightful anger at this betrayal, I consider my next move carefully. It is very clear that I cannot let this insolence go unpunished. Hwaldar earned his throne in no small part with the help of my influence. His rule only stands because of my support. \n\nAnd yet, he who united the squabbling tribes of Hillmen may yet prove useful if left alive. I must decide carefully on how best to deal with this situation."
 angmar.0501.a: "I will not let this insolence stand. Make ready for war!"
 event_angmar_0501_a: "You get a claim on the [GetTitleByKey('k_rhudaur').GetName] and start an invasion against [hwaldar.GetFullName]."
 angmar.0501.b: "He may yet be persuaded to rethink his foolish choice."
 event_angmar_0501_b: "You will demand total submission from [hwaldar.GetFullName]."
 
 angmar.0502.t: "His Last Chance Squandered"
 angmar.0502.desc: "[hwaldar.GetFullName] has refused my merciful offer, spitting in my face. There is only one answer to this insolence. \n\nSound the horns of war! Angmar shall be unleashed..."
 angmar.0502.a: "Make ready for war!"
 host_of_angmar: "Angmar-host"
 
 angmar.0503.t: "A Wise Decision"
 angmar.0503.desc: "[hwaldar.GetFullName] has wisely decided to give in to my demands and bent the knee before me. Still, I cannot let his earlier insolence go unpunished... \n\nThe [GetTitleByKey('k_rhudaur').GetName] shall be stripped from him, reducing him to a mere High Chieftain. I shall assume direct control of that wretched land and ensure there are no more rebellions against my rule."
 angmar.0503.a: "Rhudaur is mine!"
 
 angmar.0504.t: "Rhudaur Expands"
 angmar.0504.desc: "My spies bring me encouraging reports from the south. [hwaldar.GetFullName], the [hillman|E] ruler of the [GetTitleByKey('k_rhudaur').GetName], has succeeded in driving out the last remaining Dúnedain from the Angle of Mitheithel, between the rivers Bruinen and Hoarwell. \n\nHaving proven his usefulness to me, I wonder what is to be done with the so-called Chief of Chiefs, [hwaldar.GetFirstName]. I could leave him to continue his war against the Dúnedain, but he is ambitious and strong-willed. This victory might drive him to think that his alliance to [angmar|E] is no longer needed... \n\nMaybe a reminder is in order?"
 angmar.0504.a: "I shall demand tribute from the Chief of Chiefs."
 event_angmar_0504_a: "You will demand that [hwaldar.GetFullName] becomes your tributary."
 angmar.0504.b: "I shall leave him unfettered... for now."
 angmar.0505.t: "Tribute from Rhudaur"
 angmar.0505.desc: "A wise choice! [hwaldar.GetFullName] has sent an envoy, declaring his acceptance to become my tributary. \n\nHe will be of great use to me in the future. Now, I can focus on my looming war with the realms of [arthedain|E] and [cardolan|E]."
 angmar.0505.a: "The Iron Crown rises!"
 event_angmar_0505_a: "You get the [GetTitleByKey('e_angmar').GetName]"
 
 angmar.0506.t: "A Demand Turned Aside"
 angmar.0506.desc: "A messenger from [rhudaur|E] brings me the news that [hwaldar.GetFullName] has refused to become my tributary. The feckless fool! \n\nI will have to keep a close eye on the ambitious Chief of Chiefs, lest he thinks of casting off the yoke of [angmar|E] further. \n\nThere is unrest amongst those of [hwaldar.GetFirstName]'s chieftains that have begun to follow the beliefs of Angmar, and many speak of open rebellion against their Chief of Chiefs. \n\nIt would seem as if Hwaldar's punishment is already upon him..."
 angmar.0506.a: "Let them squabble!"
 event_angmar_0506_a: "The most powerful chieftains will rebel against [hwaldar.GetName]."
 
 angmar.0507.t: "His Greatest Failure"
 angmar.0507.desc: "My spies bring me frustrating reports from the south. [hwaldar.GetName], the self-styled Chief of Chiefs, has been unsuccessful in his war against the remaining Dúnedain of [rhudaur|E]. \n\nSuch is his failure that I can no longer tolerate his lacklustre leadership. It is clear that the [hillmen|E] of Rhudaur need to be administered more... closely. \n\nI shall make them direct vassals of the Iron Crown, effective immediately."
 angmar.0507.a: "Incompetence shall never be tolerated!"
 event_angmar_0507_a: "The [GetTitleByKey('k_rhudaur').GetName] is destroyed, and its remaining chieftains become your direct vassals."
 
 ## MINOR CHARACTERS ##

 angmar.3050.t: "An Envoy from Rhudaur"
 angmar.3050.desc: "What's this now? A messenger from the [hillmen|E] south of here? I don't trust'em. \n\nFine! Let him speak, if he must. Who's this [tull.GetName] anyway? Some upstart looking for allies? \n\nBah! We do not dabble in diplomacy here! And yet... Maybe I ought to give this offer some thought... \n\nOn the other hand, I'd much enjoy ripping out this messenger's heart!"
 angmar.3050.a: "Go on then! He'll have his alliance."
 angmar.3050.b: "No! Off you go, messenger, before I lose patience."
 angmar.3050.c: "He dares to order ME around? I'll take his lands, and rip his heart out!"
