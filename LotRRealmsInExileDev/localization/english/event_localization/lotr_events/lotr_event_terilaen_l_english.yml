 wander_terilaen.1001.desc: "It has been some time since I have left my forest, and I again wish to live as Men do, at least temporarily. For this purpose I have set out to travel to [destination_terilaen.GetName].\n\nAs I travel through ancient forests I contemplate the passing of time. It almost seems to stand still here, in the wooded lands of elves. The world of Men, however, changes quickly. Those I met in my past travels have grown old or already passed beyond.\nI treasure the time I live among Men ever-changing, for I know that when I return home, my realm will still be as I left it."

Though I possess great knowledge of the healing arts, it is mostly applicable to my fellow [elves|E]. The maladies of Men and their treatement are new to me.
