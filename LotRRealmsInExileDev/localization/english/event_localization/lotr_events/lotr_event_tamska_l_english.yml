 tamska.0002.t:0 "The Tamskangi Revealed"
 tamska.0002.desc:0 "One of my most trusted holy-[discoverer.GetWomenMen], [discoverer.GetName], kneels before me, [discoverer.GetHerHis] eyes gleaming with fervor as [discoverer.GetSheHe] presents a young [tamska_heir.Custom('GirlBoy')] who has passed the sacred tests set by the elders.\n\n"Great Tamska," [discoverer.GetSheHe] says, barely able to contain [discoverer.GetHerHis] excitement, "this child is the [GetTrait('tamska_heir').GetName( GetNullCharacter )]! [tamska_heir.GetSheHe|U] recognised the [Glossary('Sîyi Chele','siyi_chele_gloss')] without hesitation, harmonised with the [Glossary('Kula Luwa','kula_luwa_gloss')] as if born to it, and [tamska_heir.GetHerHis] reflection in Lake Jak shone with the [Glossary('Hase ikog Ânjike','hase_ikog_anjike_gloss')]." [discoverer.GetSheHe] gestures toward [tamska_heir.GetName], who stands before me, wide-eyed and silent.\n\n"[tamska_heir.GetSheHe|U] even navigated the [Glossary('Iga Madingi','iga_madingi_gloss')] as if [namur|E] himself guided [tamska_heir.GetHerHis] steps. [tamska_heir.GetSheHe|U] is the one, the [tamska_heir.Custom('DaughterSon')] of the gods, your rightful heir who will lead the future generations of our people on their sacred journey!"\n\nI study the [tamska_heir.Custom('GirlBoy')] before me, searching [tamska_heir.GetHerHis] face for the divine essence that should be clear to my eyes. My heart is uncertain, but my duty demands a decision."
 tamska.0002.a:0 "The signs are clear — [tamska_heir.GetSheHe] is the Tamskangi."
 tamska.0002.b:0 "No, she is not the one. [discoverer.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], you have failed me."

 tamska.0003.t:0 "The Tamskangi Revealed"
 tamska.0003.desc:0 "The news reaches me like a whisper on the wind, but it carries the weight of the heavens. A new [GetTrait('tamska_heir').GetName( GetNullCharacter )] has been found, [tamska_heir.GetName], the one who will carry the mantle of our [great_queens|E]. It is said that the elders have seen the signs, and that she has passed the sacred trials with the grace and wisdom of our divine mothers.\n\nI can scarcely contain my awe. The gods themselves have chosen her, through [namur|E]’s will, to guide us forward. A new dawn rises for our people, as my peers pledge their loyalty to her, just as they did to her predecessor.\n\nYet there is a stirring in my heart—hope, yes, but also uncertainty. For the future of our land now rests in the hands of a child."
 tamska.0003.a:0 "May her footsteps be guided well."

 tamska.0100.t:0 "The Touch of Divinity"
 tamska.0100.desc:0 "I take a deep breath. Its not everyday you get to mantle a goddess. Around me, hundreds of priests are at work, each concentrated on their own part of the ritual. Every single step I take, every gesture of my hand and every word spoken has been meticulously planned out and rehearsed, all acording to tradition.\n\nThe [GetLaw('tamska_elective_succession_law').GetName] dictates the process of transferring the divine essence of the [tamska|E], #emp my#! divine essence through a grand ceremony of prayer and meditation. Outside of the temple walls, the public eagerly awaits the rise of their new Queen, as the sanctum is barred from entry during the ceremony. I have to focus! I cannot allow myself to slip up now."
 tamska.0100.a:0 "Every rite must be performed to the letter."

 tamska.0101.desc:0 "After hours of ceremony, I rise from behind my a silver curtain, divine power coursing through my veins. I can feel that something has changed, my mind feels sharper and my gaze is stronger. With a final verse, my ascension is complete.\n\nThe priesthood is quiet as they expect my first decree."
 tamska.0101.a:0 "I am the daughter of Namur."
