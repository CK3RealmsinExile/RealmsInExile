 tamska.0001.t:0 "The Tamskangi Revealed"
 tamska.0001.desc:0 "One of my most trusted holy-[discoverer.GetWomenMen], [discoverer.GetName], kneels before me, [discoverer.GetHerHis] eyes gleaming with fervor as [discoverer.GetSheHe] presents a young [tamska_heir.Custom('GirlBoy')] who has passed the sacred tests set by the elders.\n\n"Great Tamska," [discoverer.GetSheHe] says, barely able to contain [discoverer.GetHerHis] excitement, "this child is the [GetTrait('tamska_heir').GetName( GetNullCharacter )]! [tamska_heir.GetSheHe|U] recognised the [Glossary('Forgotten Name','tamska_forgotten_name_gloss')] without hesitation, harmonised with the [Glossary('Song of the Sky','tamska_song_of_the_sky_gloss')] as if born to it, and [tamska_heir.GetHerHis] reflection in Lake Jak shone with the [Glossary('Mantle of the Divine','tamska_mantle_of_the_divine_gloss')]." [discoverer.GetSheHe] gestures toward [tamska_heir.GetName], who stands before me, wide-eyed and silent.\n\n"[tamska_heir.GetSheHe|U] even navigated the [Glossary('Trail of Whispers','tamska_trail_of_whispers_gloss')] as if [namur|E] himself guided [tamska_heir.GetHerHis] steps. [tamska_heir.GetSheHe|U] is the one, the [tamska_heir.Custom('DaughterSon')] of the gods, your rightful heir who will lead the future generations of our people on their sacred journey!"\n\nI study the [tamska_heir.Custom('GirlBoy')] before me, searching [tamska_heir.GetHerHis] face for the divine essence that should be clear to my eyes. My heart is uncertain, but my duty demands a decision."
 tamska.0001.a:0 "The signs are clear — [tamska_heir.GetSheHe] is the Tamskangi."
 tamska.0001.b:0 "No, she is not the one. [discoverer.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], you have failed me."

 tamska.0002.t:0 "The Tamskangi Revealed"
 tamska.0002.desc:0 "The news reaches me like a whisper on the wind, but it carries the weight of the heavens. A new [GetTrait('tamska_heir').GetName( GetNullCharacter )] has been found, [tamska_heir.GetName], the one who will carry the mantle of our [great_queens|E]. It is said that the elders have seen the signs, and that she has passed the sacred trials with the grace and wisdom of our divine mothers.\n\nI can scarcely contain my awe. The gods themselves have chosen her, through [namur|E]’s will, to guide us forward. A new dawn rises for our people, as my peers pledge their loyalty to her, just as they did to her predecessor.\n\nYet there is a stirring in my heart—hope, yes, but also uncertainty. For the future of our land now rests in the hands of a child."
 tamska.0002.a:0 "May her footsteps be guided well."
