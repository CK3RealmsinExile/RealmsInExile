 tamska.0002.t:0 "The Tamskangi Revealed"
 tamska.0002.desc:0 "One of my most trusted holy-[discoverer.GetWomenMen], [discoverer.GetName], kneels before me, [discoverer.GetHerHis] eyes gleaming with fervor as [discoverer.GetSheHe] presents a young [tamska_heir.Custom('GirlBoy')] who has passed the sacred tests set by the elders.\n\n"Great Tamska," [discoverer.GetSheHe] says, barely able to contain [discoverer.GetHerHis] excitement, "this child is the [GetTrait('tamska_heir').GetName( GetNullCharacter )]! [tamska_heir.GetSheHe|U] recognised the [Glossary('Sîyi Chele','siyi_chele_gloss')] without hesitation, harmonised with the [Glossary('Kula Luwa','kula_luwa_gloss')] as if born to it, and [tamska_heir.GetHerHis] reflection in Lake Jak shone with the [Glossary('Hase ikog Ânjike','hase_ikog_anjike_gloss')]." [discoverer.GetSheHe] gestures toward [tamska_heir.GetName], who stands before me, wide-eyed and silent.\n\n"[tamska_heir.GetSheHe|U] even navigated the [Glossary('Iga Madingi','iga_madingi_gloss')] as if [namur|E] himself guided [tamska_heir.GetHerHis] steps. [tamska_heir.GetSheHe|U] is the one, the [tamska_heir.Custom('DaughterSon')] of the gods, your rightful heir who will lead the future generations of our people on their sacred journey!"\n\nI study the [tamska_heir.Custom('GirlBoy')] before me, searching [tamska_heir.GetHerHis] face for the divine essence that should be clear to my eyes. My heart is uncertain, but my duty demands a decision."
 tamska.0002.a:0 "The signs are clear — [tamska_heir.GetSheHe] is the Tamskangi."
 tamska.0002.b:0 "No, she is not the one. [discoverer.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], you have failed me."

 tamska.0003.t:0 "The Tamskangi Revealed"
 tamska.0003.desc:0 "The news reaches me like a whisper on the wind, but it carries the weight of the heavens. A new [GetTrait('tamska_heir').GetName( GetNullCharacter )] has been found, [tamska_heir.GetName], the one who will carry the mantle of our [great_queens|E]. It is said that the elders have seen the signs, and that she has passed the sacred trials with the grace and wisdom of our divine mothers.\n\nI can scarcely contain my awe. The gods themselves have chosen her, through [namur|E]’s will, to guide us forward. A new dawn rises for our people, as my peers pledge their loyalty to her, just as they did to her predecessor.\n\nYet there is a stirring in my heart—hope, yes, but also uncertainty. For the future of our land now rests in the hands of a child."
 tamska.0003.a:0 "May her footsteps be guided well."

 tamska.0005.t:0 "Tamskangi in Doubt"
 tamska.0005.desc:0 "The temple air is heavy with incense and reverence as [holy_person.GetName] approaches with tentative steps. [holy_person.GetSheHe|U] bows deeply before me, [holy_person.GetHerHis] voice trembling with awe and sorrow.\n\n“Radiant daughter of [namur|E], forgive our failing. [tamska_heir.GetFirstName], once chosen to carry your spirit, grows older with each passing year. Her advancing years cast doubt upon our judgment, and I fear we have misunderstood the divine will.”\n\n[holy_person.GetHerHis|U] voice falters, and [holy_person.GetSheHe] averts [holy_person.GetHerHis] gaze. “I beg your forgiveness and seek your wisdom. Should we begin the search for another, or does the divine essence still rest with her?”\n\nI sit in silence. She was meant to be the one carry my spirit. Yet now, even the most faithful waver in their belief."
 tamska.0005.a:0 ""A new Tamskangi may arise, but she will remain my child.""
 tamska.0005.b:0 ""Commence the search, and grant her to a household of lesser station.""
 tamska.0005.c:0 ""Send her back to the people, that she may find a simpler path.""
 tamska.0005.d:0 ""I forbid the search; she will stand as my Tamskangi, now and always.""
 tamska_search_for_new_tamskangi_begins:0 "#V The search for a new Tamskangi will begin.#!"
 tamska_search_for_new_tamskangi_forbidden:0 "#V You insist [tamska_heir.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] should remain your Tamskangi.#!"

 tamska.0006.t:0 "A Change in the Divine Plan"
 tamska.0006.desc:0 "Word has spread that the Council of Elders, after years of certainty, now questions whether [tamska_heir.GetName], the [GetTrait('tamska_heir').GetName( GetNullCharacter )], is truly destined to embody the spirit of [namur|E]. [tamska_heir.GetHerHis|U] advancing years, a sharp contrast to the youthfulness traditionally associated with the divine vessel, have led the council to seek guidance from [tamska|E] [current_tamska.GetFirstNameRegnal] herself.\n\n"
 tamska.0006.desc.tamskangi_still_daughter:0 "The Tamska has decreed that the search for a new Tamskangi will commence. However, she has declared that [tamska_heir.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] will remain close to her as an honoured daughter, retaining her place within the royal household and the Tamska’s personal circle.\n\nHer bond with the divine remains cherished, even as the council looks to the future."
 tamska.0006.desc.tamskangi_with_noble:0 "The Tamska has ordered the search for a new Tamskangi, releasing [tamska_heir.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] from her family and entrusting [tamska_heir.GetHerHim] to the care of [new_vassal_mother.GetName].\n\nThough removed from the royal household, she will still be treated with dignity befitting her service to the divine, living a life of honour among trusted retainers."
 tamska.0006.desc.tamskangi_with_commoners:0 "The Tamska has commanded the council to search for a new Tamskangi and decreed that [tamska_heir.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] will live among the common folk.\n\n[tamska_heir.GetSheHe|U] is to walk a simpler path, far from the halls of power, reflecting the humility and grace expected of one once touched by the divine."
 tamska.0006.a:0 "An interesting development."

 tamska.0007.t:0 "A Change in the Divine Plan"
 tamska.0007.desc:0 "Word has spread that the Council of Elders, after years of certainty, now questions whether [tamska_heir.GetName], the [GetTrait('tamska_heir').GetName( GetNullCharacter )], is truly destined to embody the spirit of [namur|E]. [tamska_heir.GetHerHis|U] advancing years, a sharp contrast to the youthfulness traditionally associated with the divine vessel, have led the council to seek guidance from [tamska|E] [current_tamska.GetFirstNameRegnal] herself.\n\nIn an unexpected move, the Tamska has declared her unwavering faith in her Tamskangi, rejecting the council’s doubts. Despite her age, she is sure that [tamska_heir.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] is indeed the chosen vessel, carrying the promise of [namur|E]’s divine essence.\n\nWhile the Tamska’s decision is surely guided by the gods, whispers of unease are said to be rippling through the court. Can tradition and faith both be upheld, or does this signal a change beyond mortal comprehension?"
 tamska.0007.a:0 "An interesting development."

 tamska.0100.t:0 "The Touch of Divinity"
 tamska.0100.desc:0 "I take a deep breath. Its not everyday you get to mantle a goddess. Around me, hundreds of priests are at work, each concentrated on their own part of the ritual. Every single step I take, every gesture of my hand and every word spoken has been meticulously planned out and rehearsed, all acording to tradition.\n\nThe [GetLaw('tamska_elective_succession_law').GetName] dictates the process of transferring the divine essence of the [tamska|E], #emp my#! divine essence through a grand ceremony of prayer and meditation. Outside of the temple walls, the public eagerly awaits the rise of their new Queen, as the sanctum is barred from entry during the ceremony. I have to focus! I cannot allow myself to slip up now."
