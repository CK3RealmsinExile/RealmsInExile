 news_event.0001.t: "The Tedjin Civil War"
 news_event.0001.desc: "[GetTitleByKey('k_tedjin').GetName] is roiling with unrest, as the ambitious new [defender.GetTitledFirstName] seeks to push forward political and religious reforms. In response, the more conservative lords of the confederacy, led by [attacker.GetTitledFirstName] have begun to covertly resist [defender.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]'s efforts at every turn.\n\nWhile we might quickly dismiss the internal squabbles of desert tribesmen, the Tedjin are renowned fighters and mercenaries, and occupy a vital buffer between Umbar and Bellakar. Should [attacker.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] and [attacker.GetHerHis] fellow reactionary lords succeed in overthrowing [defender.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], their ambitions will surely turn South once more.\n\nFinally, the crisis in the Confederacy has reached breaking point. Formal demands for the Reformist Kataj to abdicate sent by the Reactionary Faction have been outright rejected and the two sides are now in open war.\n\nTime is fast running out for interested parties to make their interventions as the future of the Confederacy hangs in the balance."

The rebellious lords under the leadership of the reactionary [attacker.GetTitledFirstName] have been humbled, sure to be either stripped of their lands, exiled, or executed.\n\nThe old ways are fast fading in the lands of the Tedjin, and as [defender.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] intensifies [defender.GetHerHis] reforms, [defender.GetHerHis] gaze turns westward towards the coast and may even come to challenge the hegemony of the [GetTitleByKey('k_umbar').GetName] itself..."

 news_event.0007.c: "May this be the start of a more brutal conquest."

 news_event.0008.t: "Rapprochement between Bellakar and Felaya"
 news_event.0008.desc: "While technically never independent from the [GetTitleByKey('e_bellakar').GetBaseName], in practical terms the region of [GetTitleByKey('k_felaya').GetBaseNameNoTier] has acted wholly autonomously since the reign of [amrozir.GetFirstNameRegnal] almost 1000 years ago.\n\nPeriods of rapprochement and estrangement have waxed and waned between the province and the greater kingdom, as religiously it stood distinct from the southern heartlands of the kingdom, and its culture nurtured a burgeoning pride in their self-reliance. The First Lords have even warred with Bellakar in the past when they overstepped their bounds.\n\nNow at last relations appear to be on the permanent mend, as the First Lord of Felaya has officially traveled to [GetTitleByKey('c_nilulonde').GetBaseNameNoTier] to pay homage and swear fealty to their new overlord, something which has not been done since the days of [masrakayan.GetTitledFirstName] and [zimrubel.GetTitledFirstName].\n\nThis rapprochement appears to be largely due to [bellakarruler.GetTitledFirstName|U], whose careful diplomacy, overtures, and assurances to the people of Felaya as to their status within the greater kingdom has allowed the rift to be mended without a painful and bloody reconquest."

It was they who first taught the Apysaic Haradrim how to work stone and cultivate agriculture.\n\nHowever, as the Haradrim migrated into the fertile and lush valleys, a coexistence of teacher and student turned into a silent tug of war. The Honnin, unlovely to behold and slow to reproduce, were forced out by the ever multiplying Bôzishnarûd into the Sûza Sûmar, whence they lost much of their knowledge and teachings.\n\nNow though, this has changed. The Honnin, under the leadership of [honnin_restorer.GetTitledFirstName] have reclaimed their ancestral homeland, what they name the Sûzush Agkhôr. Already they are raising new great stone structures, and seem set with a grave determination to never again suffer the ruin they have now begun to recover from."

 news_event.0010.desc: "A great power, ancient in birth and might, has awoken and changed the course of the world, unlooked for and unexpected. From deep within the forest of Fangorn the ancient Onodrim, known to Men as the [ents|E], have marched to war against Isengard, seeking vengeance against the power-hungry [saruman.GetFirstName].\n\nIn a brutally decisive battle, the Ring of [isengard|E] has been torn down, and its pits have been flooded by the River Isen, sending a deluge down the valley when the Ents broke the great damn Saruman had built there. Saruman is now a prisoner within his own tower and the Ents having hunted down every last of his Uruk-hai in the region, extinguishing the last of his power.\n\nThe Children of Yavanna have dealt a decisive blow against the darkness this day."
 news_event.0010.a: "A triumph for all that is good in this world!"

Long they have conspired to retake the throne, and their propaganda has oft spurred the Corsairs to raid, pillage and sack. \n\nHowever, Umbar has been too disunified to truly pose any threat to [gondor|E].

 news_event.0015.desc: "It is a thing long thought impossible. But [unifier.GetTitledFirstName] has defied the physical challenge of the Dune Sea and forged a unified realm of [GetTitleByKey('e_harad').GetBaseNameNoTier] for the first time in known history, from the rich lands of the Haruze in the north to the furthest deserts of the south.\n\nNo longer will the people of [harad|E] be second-rate powers, pawns in the games of the [numenoreans|E] or Sauron.

Their newly coronated leader now leads thousands of Dunlending settlers across the Isen into the ancient lands of Calenardhon. \n\nAll eyes now turn to see which way the Dunlendings will move next.

 news_event.0017.desc: "For generations the [elves|E] of the [greenwoodshort|E] slowly retreated, gathering in the northern third of the forest, abandoning their previous capitals.\n\nThe great kingdom of Oropher shrank, and the encroachments of [conceptracemen|E] and the Shadow alike transformed the forest. The southern forest became a dark and twisted place, unfriendly and dangerous.\n\nBut after a long and gruelling campaign the elves have finally reclaimed the southern forest, declared the restoration of the former kingdom of [greenwood|E], and set about making the great woods a place of light and beauty once again."

 news_event.0018.desc: "For time out of mind, the Woodmen and their brethren in the Vale have remained fiercely independent, both from outsiders and from each other. Only in the direst of need have the fractious tribes elected a single ruler, the All-Thane or 'Aledegan', to unite their efforts against a common enemy. \n\nBut times have changed. News has reached us that under a strong new dynasty a great new realm of Aladegana has been forged, uniting both the Anduin Vale and the traditional lands of the Woodmen in the great forest of Greenwood. The disparate folk of Wood and Vale have all sworn to the new leader, and acknowledged the right of their heirs to rule in perpetuity. After long centuries of division, it seems a new power has risen in the northlands..."

With the departures of Eorl and Leofr with the greater part of the Éothéod the dwindling remnant were too weak to assert their claim to the Vale, and pressure from Goblin raids and Woodmen usurpers long prevented any hope of a resurgence.\n\nYet under the leadership of a new lord the 'Framlings' have rallied. Once again the northern Vale is dominated by the sons of Fram, their valour proven at the point of a sword, and the Kingdom of the Éothéod is resurgent astride the roots of the Great River. \n\nThere are even rumblings that the renewed Northern Kingdom may seek to assert itself over the sons of Eorl & Leofr to the south..."

 news_event.0020.desc: "For many generations Mardrûak was an integral part of Bellakar. It housed cities which helped form the foundation of the Bellakarian League, and it remained (mostly) a loyal province all through the Tedjin invasions and well into the Third Age. But during the Days of Strife both Mardrûak and Felaya drifted out of Bellakar's control. \n\nNow, with Felaya already having bowed to the throne at Nilûlondê, news reaches us that Bellakar has brought the last of its northern provinces back into the fold. It seems that at long last Bellakar is rising again..."

Yet word reaches us that this long sundering is no more.\n\nNow, the great [unifier.GetName] has claimed the mantle of a reunited Éothéod, calling on their peoples to cast aside that which divides them and come together as one people once more.
