 news_event.0001.desc:0 "[GetTitleByKey('k_tedjin').GetName] is roiling with unrest, as the ambitious new [defender.GetTitledFirstName] seeks to push forward political and religious reforms. In response, the more conservative lords of the confederacy, led by [attacker.GetTitledFirstName] have begun to covertly resist [defender.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]'s efforts at every turn.\n\nWhile we might quickly dismiss the internal squabbles of desert tribesmen, the Tedjin are renowned fighters and mercenaries, and occupy a vital buffer between Umbar and Bellakar. Should [attacker.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] and [attacker.GetHerHis] fellow reactionary lords succeed in overthrowing [defender.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], their ambitions will surely turn South once more.\n\nFinally, the crisis in the Confederacy has reached breaking point. Formal demands for the Reformist Kataj to abdicate sent by the Reactionary Faction have been outright rejected and the two sides are now in open war.\n\nTime is fast running out for interested parties to make their interventions as the future of the Confederacy hangs in the balance."

The First Lords have even warred with Bellakar in the past when they overstepped their bounds.\n\nNow at last relations appear to be on the permanent mend, as the First Lord of Felaya has officially traveled to [GetTitleByKey('c_nilulonde').GetBaseNameNoTier] to pay homage and swear fealty to their new overlord, something which has not been done since the days of [masrakayan.GetTitledFirstName] and [zimrubel.GetTitledFirstName].\n\nThis rapprochement appears to be largely due to [bellakarruler.GetTitledFirstName|U], whose careful diplomacy, overtures, and assurances to the people of Felaya as to their status within the greater kingdom has allowed the rift to be mended without a painful and bloody reconquest."

It was they who first taught the Apysaic Haradrim how to work stone and cultivate agriculture.\n\nHowever, as the Haradrim migrated into the fertile and lush valleys, a coexistence of teacher and student turned into a silent tug of war. The Honnin, unlovely to behold and slow to reproduce, were forced out by the ever multiplying Bôzishnarûd into the Sûza Sûmar, whence they lost much of their knowledge and teachings.\n\nNow though, this has changed. The Honnin, under the leadership of [honnin_restorer.GetTitledFirstName] have reclaimed their ancestral homeland, what they name the Sûzush Agkhôr.

The determined and bellicose Tûlwangi Rebels have prevailed over the [black_numenorean|E] forces of the [southerndragonarmyadunaic|E], destroying much of their forces.\n\nVast swathes of the [bayoftulwang|E] have been freed from Storm-Host rule, and for the first time in years uncounted the natives of the region are free from foreign lordship.

Countless villages were put the torch, prisoners massacared, and those even related to potential rebels summarily executed.\n\nLike so many before them, they tried and failed to gain their freedom from the Anbalûkkhôri."

Great Eagles flock above, their wingbeats the anthem of a storm of judgement. Horns sound in the deeps, echoing a song forgotten to mannish ears. It is a host beyond all mortal comprehension.\n\nAs the shadow lengthens upon [middleearth|E], a possibility unthought of has now been fulfilled - that the Undying would once more come to mortal lands to succor them from the tyranny of the shadow. At their helm stands [eonwecharacter|E], banner-bearer and herald of [manwecharactershort|E] the Elder King. His face grave, as if carved of stone, for the battle to come will surely bring desolation to [middleearth|E], whether victory or defeat.\n\nThe wrath of the [valar|E] has come."

[unifier.GetName], one of the great rulers of those lands, has achieved what many believed impossible, unifying the proud but independent princes of the [balan_lai|E]. The gathering of the council was electric, as the voice of [unifier.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] rang out among the hallowed halls of their meeting place, promising a future of strength, prosperity, and common purpose.\n\nAmid murmurs of both hope and uncertainty, the gathered lords set aside their differences, some through persuasion, others by necessity, as one by one, they swore allegiance to a new imperial order. [unifier.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] now dons the mantle of a ruler not just of one realm, but of all Thâni-Hazâd, an empire born from the ashes of disunity. Yet, beneath the gilded surface, whispers of dissent can still be heard.\n\nWill this new realm thrive and usher in an era of peace and progress, or is it merely the calm before a storm of rebellion and intrigue?"

In a gathering that began with thinly veiled hostility, [dissolver.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] declared the dissolution of the council, casting aside the institution that had kept the balance of power for generations.\n\nAs [dissolver.GetHerHis] words echoed through the chamber, the assembled lords erupted into chaos. Some fled in fear, while others called for blood. The Old Order, with all its tradition and fragile peace, is no more. The once-mighty [balan_lai|E] crumbles as each prince now turns to their own devices, unsure of what authority to follow.\n\nWhat remains of the Thâni-Hazâd stands on a precipice. Will the remaining Princes carve out new dominions in the vacuum of power, or will [dissolver.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] bold gamble lead to a swift consolidation of authority under [dissolver.GetHerHis] rule?"

As [dissolver.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] forces breached the gates of the council’s stronghold, the ruling princes fled or surrendered, and the ancient institution of the [balan_lai|E] dissolved into dust under the weight of conquest.\n\nThe banners of [dissolver.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] now fly over the ruins of an era, and the people of Thâni-Hazâd look toward a future shaped not by their own lords, but by an outsider. Some whisper that this is the death knell for Kharadûnâi rule, while others hope that [dissolver.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] reign might bring a new order and stability after years of infighting and intrigue.\n\nWill the conqueror usher in an age of dominance, or will the fires of rebellion and resistance burn hotter than ever in the ashes of the old council?"
