 lotr_great_project.1000.desc.second: "The first stones are shifted, and the rubble of ages begins to clear. Collapsed halls are cleared, broken stone hauled away, and ancient passages reopened for the first time in generations.\n\nThe scars of ruin remain everywhere, but beneath the rubble the bones of a great delving endure. Fires are lit once more, scaffolds raised, and the steady rhythm of labour echoes through the stone. This place is no longer abandoned and is coming back to life."
 #"The temple has expanded, now encompassing more shrines and ornaments — all carefully built, all reflecting reverence to #EMP me#!. \n\nMy servants hover around me like shadows as I walk around the temple, taking in every nook and cranny, meeting my followers as I go. I feel my power grow with each bowed head and respectfully averted glance.\n\nThis is #EMP my#! time."
 lotr_great_project.1000.desc.third: "The delving stirs with life. Rebuilt halls connect once-isolated chambers, and sturdy foundations replace what was lost to time and calamity.\n\nHomes, workshops, and storehouses rise in careful measure. The sound of hammer on anvil carries through the corridors, and the capital begins to feel less like a worksite and more like a city once more."
 #"The temple, now expanded into a larger compound, is bustling with a general commotion. Now there is room to house dozens of far-away travelers as well as local clergy. The daily worship never ceases.\n\nThe travelers — here to see me. The clergy — here to worship me.\n\nThe crowds diligently part to let me through, and I pause briefly to touch a few bowed heads along my path. My people. My followers. My divinity."
 lotr_great_project.1000.desc.fourth: "Order returns to the depths of the halls. Grand thoroughfares are widened and reinforced, light and water carefully guided through stone by ingenious works of craft.\n\nThe capital is no longer merely functional. The capital is no longer merely functional. Ornament and design return, honouring both beauty and strength. Walking these halls now, one feels their purpose. Where they were once shaped not just to endure, they now inspire in equal measure."
 #"As the sun rises over the temple complex, the reflection pools light up in divine magnificence.\n\nI take in the sight of the temple, now complete with wide water features and a small reliquary, gathering the most exquisite of relics.\n\nSlowly, I nod — yes, this is where I am meant to be. This is what I am meant to do. My followers need me; I am here to guide their path, and in return they have built me this splendid temple. We will accomplish great things, #EMP together.#!"
 lotr_great_project.1000.desc.final: "The final works are complete. The halls stand as a triumph of [dwarven|E] skill. Its stone has been carefully shaped, its hallways reinforced, and every corner serving both purpose and pride.\n\nIts workshops hum with industry, homes and storehouses are full, and its defenses are strong. Merchants, craftsmen, and guards all move through the delving with with a sense of pride and wonder. This capital has been fully reclaimed, a testament to what the Dwarves can achieve when labour, expertise, and determination are combined."
 #"The final stone has finally been placed in my complex in [project_location.GetNameNoTooltip].\n\nThe temple palace awaits. I allow myself a moment of pure joy and awe as I look out over the transcendent spires, arches and [Glossary( 'barays', 'BARAY_GLOSS' )]. The temple is filled with an otherworldly splendor.\n\nAround me people are cheering and dancing, celebrating one of my largest achievements — one which will be remembered for ages to come."
