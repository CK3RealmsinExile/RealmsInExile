 bellakar.0100.desc:0 "Long have the Tumakveh stood, proud and stalwart, as the kings of Bellakar and leaders of the faithful of the Kâthasaptha. They have endured trials and tribulations many, invasions, civil wars, and other woes - but still they endure. Now, the Tumakveh have at their head Nîlûhîn II. \n\nThe young king of Bellakar, though thrust upon the throne before his time, has swiftly proven himself a dynamic and energetic ruler. The [bellakarientail|E] is united behind him in support of his reign, and Bellakar steels itself for conflict that is brewing. \n\nAnd of late, Nîlûhîn's dreams have been troubled, deep and dark - premonitions of a darkness coming from the north, east, and south, consuming all in its path, rushing to the seas. Yet just as many dreams show the darkness turned back at the last moment, by a light more brilliant than any seen on this earth, blighted out until not a shadow remains. \n\nWhatever is coming, Nîlûhîn will meet it with all the valour of a king of his line, a worthy scion of [zimrebal_long|E]."

 bellakar.0101.desc:0 "I once more find myself in dream, though this is different from the ones I have had of late. I am in a forest, wearing simple clothes but of good make. In the distance I can hear a voice ringing through the trees, as moonlight breaks through the canopy. \n\n"King of Bellakar, the hour is nigh, when the fate of the faithful shall be decided at last. The house of Silmalondë shall play its part, as it did once before, but heed well my warning - victory shall come from a hope unseen, and from the north comes the Line of Kings..." \n\nThe starlight grows to blinding levels, yet before it overwhelms me, I can make out a tall, grim figure in the forest canopy. I awaken to find myself in a cold sweat, only able to half-remember what it was I saw."
 bellakar.0101.a:0 "...From the North shall come the Line of the Kings?"
 
 bellakar.0102.t:0 "Heed the Dream?"
 bellakar.0102.desc:0 "Ever since I awoke from that most strange dream, I have been thinking about it. Even now, months later, I cannot remove it from my mind. From the North shall come the Line of the Kings? Victory from hope unseen? \n\nWhat Kings are these, and what victory shall be won? I think I can understand it means that victory or defeat hangs upon a battle waging in the north, and that these Kings shall play a vital role. \n\nThe only such kings I can think of are those of our long-ago allies, the house of Elendil. Long has it been since we have had any sort of dealings with the heirs of Elendil, and from what I know the Stewards now rule in Gondor. Yet the dream remains. Could they need our aid, as once we aided Elendil, and fought before the gates of the Dark Lord himself? \n\nYet my own land is not unthreatened - it would alarm my vassals if I should push for a northward expedition on little more than a dream..."

Our renewed alliance with them brought our two realms closer after centuries of isolation, and our ruling dynasties are now united in blood.\n\nGondor's almost inconceivable defeat of Sauron has led to a wonderous sense of renewal and hope across the Faithful realms... and for some, proof that the line of Elendil is indeed divinely appointed by the Valar - both to rule, and to offer prayers and supplications on behalf of the Faithful. \n\nMany followers of Kâthasaptha now say that Narkuzîr was right in his attempts to bring the sacred rites in line with those of the Elendili, and those who follow the Batân an-Izindi also now convert to Erulaitalë in great numbers, calling for the King of Gondor - with Tumakveh blood flowing in his veins - to intercede for the Bellakaranî upon Mindolluin."

They offer to restore the alliance of old, which served Gondor so well during the years of the Ship Kings. \n\nI ruminate on the Oath of Macilion of Silmalondë, and the Debt of Elendil. Once our realms fought side by side. Yet Elendil's debt was repaid. And the Faithful of Bellakar remains astray, their tenets and rites corrupted by contact with local cults. After so many years, can Bellakar truly be trusted to come to our aid? And should the blood of Gondor be shed for a distant realm, one that denied the suzerainty of Elendil?"

For in their height, bearing, and in the very light of their eyes the air of Anadûnê can still be discerned. \n\nA scroll is placed in my hand, its seal bearing the White Tree of Gondor.
