### WIP ### issue #229 -> Unite the Faithful Realms decision
#### First event in Uniting Faithful realms chain - Bellakar side (people in bellakar revert to faith in gondor) ####
 bellakar.0200.t: "A Question of Faith"
 bellakar.0200.desc: "The world is changed. I feel it in the water. I feel it in the earth. I smell it in the air. Ever since news reached us that the line of Elendil had returned to the throne of Gondor, there arose whispers that a new age was beginning. Our renewed alliance with them brought our two realms closer after centuries of isolation, and our ruling dynasties are now united in blood.\n\nGondor's almost inconceivable defeat of Sauron has led to a wondrous sense of renewal and hope across the Faithful realms... and for some, proof that the line of Elendil is indeed divinely appointed by the Valar - both to rule and to offer prayers and supplications on behalf of the Faithful.\n\nMany followers of [Glossary('Kâthasaptha','kathasaptha_gloss')] now say that Narkuzîr was right in his attempts to bring the sacred rites in line with those of the Elendili, and those who follow the [Glossary('Batân an-Izindi','batan_an_izindi_gloss')] also now convert to Erulaitalë in great numbers, calling for the King of Gondor - with Tumakveh blood flowing in his veins - to intercede for the Bellakaranî upon Mindolluin."
 bellakar.0200.a: "And I will join them! The Faithful must be united in a single Fellowship."
 bellakar.0200.b: "Bellakar has no need of religious strife - we must stick to the old ways."

#### First event in Uniting Faithful realms chain - Felaya side IF INDEPENDENT #### 
 bellakar.0201.t: "The Unification of the Faithful?"
 bellakar.0201.desc: "I find myself faced with a choice more difficult than any of my forebears since the Downfall. The waves of conversions to Erulaitalë have continued across Bellakar and Felaya, with the [Glossary('Batân an-Izindi','batan_an_izindi_gloss')] being shaken by an especially intense reformatory fervour. Many now call for the Faithful to be united under the line of Elendil, both spiritually... and in a single realm. To deny them now risks civil war. But might civil war come anyway if the traditionalists resist?\n\n[high_king_of_gondor.GetName] scries the chance to achieve what Elendil could not and has made a bold yet subtle offer: What if I were to give him homage and recognise him as my liege, and in exchange I and my heirs were to keep the throne of Felaya and its vassals while renouncing the kingship in exchange for the title of 'Prince'? A loss of status, yes, but perhaps Felaya and the Thônuzîrahîn would carry on much as before..."
 bellakar.0201.a: "It is time. We will submit to the Elendili."
 bellakar.0201.b: "No! The rule of Felaya is mine!"

 bellakar.0202.desc: "I find myself faced with a choice more difficult than any of my forebears since the Downfall. The waves of conversions to Erulaitalë have continued across Bellakar, and many now call for the Faithful to be united under the line of Elendil, both spiritually... and in a single realm. Many who feel profound loyalty to the Tumakveh see a king of Gondor with Tumakveh blood in his veins and argue that there is no need to compromise between their faith and their allegiance.

#### Gondor has refused its claim on Bellakar #### 
 bellakar.0203.t: "United Faith, Divided Rule"
 bellakar.0203.desc: "In the palace gardens I am approached by the ambassador from Gondor, bearing a scroll from [high_king_of_gondor.GetName]. As I read its contents, I marvel that such a small parchment could contain a message of such historic import:\n\n"My forebear Elendil recognised that the Adûnâi of the Southlands had not fallen under the Shadow and that the Bellakaranî were to be treated as Faithful. Yet, out of respect for your own forebear Macilion of Silmalondë, he made no claim of lordship upon the men of Bellakar, but only over those of the Westlands who had chosen to submit themselves to his authority. \n\nI do not intend to reverse the policy of Elendil. Bellakar is in fellowship with Gondor. We will never deny our kinship. But you should remain free forever, guarding the Faithful of the South, and upholding there the legacy of Númenor."\n\nSo it is to be fellowship and freedom for them. Bellakar shall keep her independence!"
 bellakar.0203.a: "We aided Gondor freely, and we shall remain free."

#### GRAND EVENT OF BELLAKAR TITLES MERGING #### 
 bellakar.0204.t: "Union of the Faithful"
 bellakar.0204.desc: "It is done. I have bowed my head to the king in Gondor, for to do otherwise would have been folly. I have kept my seat in Nilulonde, and the Faithful Realms in Exile are now united, but I find myself a mere vassal.\n\nYet I cannot help but wonder what will come next. Can unity be sustained? And what other territorial ambitions might the High King have?"
 bellakar.0204.a: "Time will tell." # It has been done

 bellakar.0205.desc: "My worst fears have become realised. I had hoped that by seeking to maintain Bellakar's ancient traditions and faith, we might have peace in these lands in my own reign and that of my heirs. Yet it seems it will not be so. \n\nWord has reached me that those of my vassals who have embraced Erulaitalë, disgusted at my rejection of unity with Gondor, have commenced a rebellion. They announce that I must be deposed and replaced with a king more willing to submit to the House of Elendil. How did it come to this?"
 bellakar.0205.a: "It is war, then."

#### Felaya IF VASSAL of Bellakar #### 
 bellakar.0206.t: "A Question of Loyalties"
 bellakar.0206.desc: "With mass conversions to Erulaitalë sweeping the realm, [high_king_of_bellakar.GetName] has bowed to the inevitable and submitted to [high_king_of_gondor.GetName]. Bellakar is to become a mere kingdom subject to the High King in Gondor. \n\nBut what of Felaya? I am faced with a choice. Do I retain my loyalty to Bellakar and accept my own effective reduction to mere ducal rank while retaining my vassals? Or break away, swearing fealty directly to the High King of Gondor? I find myself torn, doubting whether I can separate the interests of Felaya from those of my own dynasty..."
 bellakar.0206.a: "I must honour my oath. Felaya will remain in Bellakar." # I give up my throne to stay a loyal vassal to Bellakar or something - becomes duke
 bellakar.0206.b: "I will not be demoted! I will swear to the House of Elendil..." # I deserve to stand ALONGSIDE the king of bellakar, not behind - breaks away

### Gondor receives message about MAKING an alliance with Bellakar ###
 bellakar.0250.t: "An Offer From The South" 
 bellakar.0250.desc: "For some years, rumours have arrived from the south, brought by traders and captured corsairs, concerning the realm of Bellakar. It seems their fortunes have been good of late, and after years of stasis and stalemate, they have once again asserted control over the lands of Felaya and Mardurak. \n\nYet the latest news comes unlooked for - my Steward brings me word that ambassadors have arrived from the court of [high_king_of_bellakar.GetName]. They offer to restore the alliance of old, which served Gondor so well during the years of the Ship Kings. \n\nI ruminate on the Oath of Macilion of Silmalondë and the Debt of Elendil. Once our realms fought side by side. Yet Elendil's debt was repaid. And the Faithful of Bellakar remain astray, their tenets and rites corrupted by contact with local cults. After so many years, can Bellakar truly be trusted to come to our aid? And should the blood of Gondor be shed for a distant realm, one that denied the suzerainty of Elendil?"
 bellakar.0250.a: "It is time to reforge the alliance. We will draw swords together!"
 bellakar.0250.b: "We must look to our own resources..."

### Bellakar receives message of Gondor accepting alliance ###
 bellakar.0251.t: "An Alliance Restored"
 bellakar.0251.desc: "At last our emissaries have returned, accompanied by ambassadors from Gondor. As they approach the throne, I hear murmurs from my courtiers and see them staring open-mouthed at the northmen. And no wonder. While we pride ourselves on our Númenórean heritage, it is clear that in the north the blood must still run more truly. For in their height, bearing, and in the very light of their eyes, the air of Anadûnê can still be discerned. \n\nA scroll is placed in my hand, its seal bearing the White Tree of Gondor. Unfurling it, I quickly take in the two columns of fine script in the bold hand of [high_king_of_gondor.GetName], one in Adunaic, the other in Sindarin. But my eyes are drawn to the final line, written in perfect Sindarin: \n\n"As Elendil and Macilion before us, let us draw swords together!" \n\nAn alliance it is then. The northern Faithful will aid us in our hour of need. Now we must prepare to deploy this new League against our foes..."
 bellakar.0251.a: "The Faithful, united again"

### Bellakar receives message of Gondor !! NOT !! accepting alliance ###
 bellakar.0252.t: "Gondor's Refusal" 
 bellakar.0252.desc: "At last our emissaries have returned, and my heart sinks as I see they are unaccompanied. Has Gondor sent no ambassador to Nilûlondê?\n\nA scroll is placed in my hand, its seal bearing the White Tree of Gondor. Unfurling it, I quickly take in the two columns of fine script in the bold hand of [high_king_of_gondor.GetName], one in Adunaic, the other in Sindarin. My heart sinks further. The words are respectful but firm: \n\n"Oaths were made, and oaths were fulfilled. No debt is now owed to Gondor or to Bellakar. Too long have our realms been sundered, and Gondor must now look to its own affairs...""
 bellakar.0252.a: "Alone, then..."

### Bellakar received message that Gondor ruler died, RENEW alliance ###
 bellakar.0253.t: "An Oath Renewed?" 
 bellakar.0253.desc: "As I sit rifling through the latest reports from my Council, I am interrupted by my Steward informing me of news from the north - the [dead_high_king_of_gondor.GetName] of Gondor is dead. \n\nTheir successor, [high_king_of_gondor.GetName], has written to me to assure me that the policy of Gondor has not changed and that they wish to renew the alliance between our kingdom. Yet they recognise that they have no claim on me or my realm. It is an alliance of choice, not of obligation.\n\nI must now decide whether to continue to bind Bellakar and Gondor together or whether now is the time to free ourselves of distant ties."
 bellakar.0253.a: "We are stronger together. Renew the alliance!"
 bellakar.0253.b: "We must look to our own affairs..."

### The Golden Lands / decision_proclaim_pharazain
 bellakar.0300.t: "The Golden Lands"
 bellakar.0300.desc: "Once, the lands of Southwestern [middleearth|E] were dominated by the strength of mighty [numenor|e]. Though divided, these Númenórean colonies south of [GetTitleByKey('k_umbar').GetNameNoTier] came to be known in the homeland as [GetTitleByKey('h_pharazain').GetNameNoTier] - the Golden Lands, from which riches flowed to the Isle of the Star.\n\nYet since the [downfallofnumenor|E] an Age ago, these lands have stood divided; petty kingdoms and realms that have fought amongst each other for countless years, waxing and waning over time. Yet the memory of Númenor still lived on, and so did the faint idea of the golden lands of [GetTitleByKey('h_pharazain').GetNameNoTierNoTooltip].\n\nFinally, under my banner, all the former colonies of the south have been united, and the memory of that ancient name may now finally be reborn with newfound purpose!"
 bellakar.0300.a: "Glory to the Golden Dominion of [GetTitleByKey('h_pharazain').GetNameNoTierNoTooltip]!"

 bellakar.0301.t: "The Glory of Korlea Restored"
 bellakar.0301.desc: "During the reign of [numenor|E], Korlea was [bellakar|E]'s prime haven and center of trade, learning, and warfare. And so it shall be again!\n\nFrom this day forward, we shall work to recover the glory that was lost in the raging flood of the Downfall, and ensure that such a tragedy can never happen again. Korlea now once more takes its places as the first among the mighty havens of Bellakar, a monument to our valor and steadfastness for all to see!"
 bellakar.0301.a: "A historic day indeed!"

 bellakar.0302.t: "The Izindubêth and the Âru"
 bellakar.0302.desc: "This ia a monumentous occasion. The Âru and the Izindubêth, twin pillars of spiritual authority in the lands of [bellakar|E], once again meeting after centuries of estrangement.\n\nWhile the Kings may have failed to prevent many of the Izindubêth's flock being drawn astray by the Castamirioni, and the Izindubêths may have refused to support Nîlûlondê against the Vâtrathôr usurpers, today we put the past behind us. Standing side-by-side, we affirm our commitment to building a  prosperous future for all the [faithful|E] of Bellakar, together."
 bellakar.0302.a: "May Êru guide us both"
 
 bellakar.2000.t: "The Teal Conspiracy"
 bellakar.2000.desc: "Since the ancient days of the [numenorean_empire|E], the glorious land that was to become [bellakar|E] has been associated with the royal color magenta. But lately, I've been obsessed with something else: The color teal.\n\nIt's simply everywhere! Before me, evidence of a grand anti-teal conspiracy is spread across a wall and table, hidden connections laid bare in wonderfully teal string: An ancient record references a grand [black_numenorean|E] realm sporting tealen banners. The forgotten crypt of a Bellakarani noble, buried with a teal burial shroud. Rumors about the grand Statue of Ishtra, which #emp must#! have once possessed wings of teal. If correctly counted out and rearranged, the months in the Bellakar Reckoning calendar literally spell out "REALM IS TEAL"!\n\n"Is everything alright, my [chancellor.Custom2('RelationToMeShort', SCOPE.sC('pepe_silva'))]?" I turn around and see [chancellor.GetTitledFirstName] at the door, eyeing me with concern. Who else is in on this conspiracy to erase our teal past? Is it not my duty as [pepe_silva.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] to restore [bellakar|E] to its true colors?"
 bellakar.2000.a: "I must #emp teal#! everyone!"
 bellakar.2000.b: "...Forget about it."
