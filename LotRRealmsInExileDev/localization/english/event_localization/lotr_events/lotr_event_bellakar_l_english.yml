 bellakar.0101.t:0 "A Dream of the North"
 bellakar.0101.desc:0 "I once more find myself in dream, though this is different from the ones I have had of late. I am in a forest, wearing simple clothes but of good make. In the distance I can hear a voice ringing through the trees, as moonlight breaks through the canopy. \n\n"King of Bellakar, the hour is nigh, when the fate of the faithful shall be decided at last. The house of Silmalondë shall play its part, as it did once before, but heed well my warning - victory shall come from a hope unseen, and from the north comes the Line of Kings..." \n\nThe starlight grows to blinding levels, yet before it overwhelms me, I can make out a tall, grim figure in the forest canopy. I awaken to find myself in a cold sweat, only able to half-remember what it was I saw."
 bellakar.0101.a:0 "...From the North shall come the Line of the Kings?"
 
 bellakar.0102.t:0 "Heed the Dream?"
 bellakar.0102.desc:0 "Ever since I awoke from that most strange dream, I have been thinking about it. Even now, months later, I cannot remove it from my mind. From the North shall come the Line of the Kings? Victory from hope unseen? \n\nWhat Kings are these, and what victory shall be won? I think I can understand it means that victory or defeat hangs upon a battle waging in the north, and that these Kings shall play a vital role. \n\nThe only such kings I can think of are those of our long-ago allies, the house of Elendil. Long has it been since we have had any sort of dealings with the heirs of Elendil, and from what I know the Stewards now rule in Gondor. Yet the dream remains. Could they need our aid, as once we aided Elendil, and fought before the gates of the Dark Lord himself? \n\nYet my own land is not unthreatened - it would alarm my vassals if I should push for a northward expedition on little more than a dream..."
 bellakar.0102.a:0 "Ladnôca has spoken to me, as she once spoke to Zimrêbal himself!"
 bellakar.0102.b:0 "Gondor must fend for itself, whatever should come for it"

Ever since news reached us that the line of Elendil had returned to the throne of Gondor, there arose whispers that a new age was beginning. Our renewed alliance with them brought our two realms closer after centuries of isolation, and our ruling dynasties are now united in blood.\n\nGondor's almost inconceivable defeat of Sauron has led to a wonderous sense of renewal and hope across the Faithful realms... and for some, proof that the line of Elendil is indeed divinely appointed by the Valar - both to rule, and to offer prayers and supplications on behalf of the Faithful. \n\nMany followers of Kâthasaptha now say that Narkuzîr was right in his attempts to bring the sacred rites in line with those of the Elendili, and those who follow the Batân an-Izindi also now convert to Erulaitalë in great numbers, calling for the King of Gondor - with Tumakveh blood flowing in his veins - to intercede for the Bellakaranî upon Mindolluin."

Yet, out of respect for your own forebear Macilion of Silmalondë, he made no claim of lordship upon the men of Bellakar, but only over those of the Westlands who had chosen to submit themselves his authority. \n\nI do not intend to reverse the policy of Elendil. Bellakar is in fellowship with Gondor. We will never deny our kinship. But you should remain free forever, guarding the Faithful of the South, and upholding there the legacy of Númenor."\n\nSo it is to be fellowship and freedom them.

 bellakar.0250.desc:0 "For some years rumours have arrived from the south, brought by traders and captured corsairs, concerning the realm of Bellakar. It seems their fortunes have been good of late, and after years of stasis and stalemate they have once again asserted control over the lands of Felaya and Mardurak. \n\nYet the latest news comes unlooked for - my Steward brings me word that ambassadors have arrived from the court of [high_king_of_bellakar.GetName]. They offer to restore the alliance of old, which served Gondor so well during the years of the Ship Kings. \n\nI ruminate on the Oath of Macilion of Silmalondë, and the Debt of Elendil. Once our realms fought side by side. Yet Elendil's debt was repaid. And the Faithful of Bellakar remains astray, their tenets and rites corrupted by contact with local cults. After so many years, can Bellakar truly be trusted to come to our aid? And should the blood of Gondor be shed for a distant realm, one that denied the suzerainty of Elendil?"

As they approach the throne I hear murmurs from my courtiers, and see them staring open-mouthed at the northmen. And no wonder. While we pride ourselves on our Númenórean heritage, it is clear that in the north the blood must still run more truly. For in their height, bearing, and in the very light of their eyes the air of Anadûnê can still be discerned. \n\nA scroll is placed in my hand, its seal bearing the White Tree of Gondor. Unfurling it, I quickly take in the two columns of fine script in the bold hand of [high_king_of_gondor.GetName], one in Adunaic, the other in Sindarin. But my eyes are drawn to the final line, written in perfect Sindarin: \n\n"As Elendil and Macilion before us, let us draw swords together!" \n\nAn alliance it is then. The northern Faithful will aid us in our hour of need. Now we must prepare to deploy this new League against our foes..."
