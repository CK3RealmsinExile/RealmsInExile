 gundabad.0200.t:0 "Revitalisation of the Orcs"
 gundabad.0200.desc:0 "For far too long, the Orcs of the North have forgotten their past. They wander about not different with wild dogs, only to be helplessly slaughtered by the men that have grown in strength since the mishap at Dale! Guided by the great Ulûkai and the blood of Azog that grants [ROOT.Char.GetHerHim] great power and wit so desperately needed, [ROOT.Char.GetFirstNameRegnal] has once again cemented Orcish supremacy in the Anduin Vale.\n\nNow that we finally established secure control over the various bridges and fords across the Anduin, the wrath of Mount Gundabad will be felt by all throughout the North. Already warg riders are scouting for potential targets. May our raids swiftly befall any who dare to oppose us, men or elves!"
 gundabad.0200.a:0 "Great terror shall ride forth from Gundabad once more!"

 gundabad.0201.t:0 "Master of the North"
 gundabad.0201.desc:0 "Bolg's folly was more than avenged when the Orc horde overran not only the Mannish kingdom of Dale, but also laid waste to the damned Greenwood. Now truly broken, the vile Men and Elves are on the run, their strongest fortifications laid low by our great trolls, their people scattered to be the prey of wild beasts and warg riders, and their riches emptied all for the lord of Gundabad. With this newfound wealth, our boys could certainly use some fresh meat instead of maggoty bread, amongst other things.\n\nNow that the Tarks will be without any assistance from the North, the eventual assault on Minas Tirith seems all the more imminent. Let them tremble in fear, for their inevitable doom is coming!"
 gundabad.0201.a:0 "Our lordship over these lands shall ensure for a hundred generations!"

 gundabad.0202.t:0 "Ignite the Forges of Gundabad"
 gundabad.0202.desc:0 "The mountain thunders with the blows of hammers on anvils, new weapons and armors are piled high.\n\nDeep under the mountain forges never sleep and steadily produces means of war. As I walk through the forges, I see weapons and armor fit for trolls piling up.\n\nIgnited dwarven forges of Gundabad made it possible to produce stronger steel suitable for being used by trolls and strgongest of gundabad warriors."
 gundabad.0202.a:0 "No army will be able to stop me now!"

 gundabad.1001.t:0 "A Question of Leadership"
 gundabad.1001.desc:0 "My decisive show of strength has finally brought the northern reaches of the Anduin Vale under my control, but already the local menfolk grow restless and are beginning to resist their rightful overlords. The war-hungry warriors of my host are eager to tear the heart out of this foolish resistance just as it starts beating, relishing the prospect of plunder and bloodshed that it would bring.\n\nYet there are some among the menfolk that are weak, cowardly and corruptable, who may be able to keep their people in line if given the chance to rule over them."
 gundabad.1001.a:0 "Give them control over what land I have taken."
 gundabad.1001.b:0 "Let them have it all, I need my best for the wars ahead!"
 gundabad.1001.c:0 "There is no place left in this world for men!"
 gundabad.1001.d:0 "I don't have time for this..."
 gundabad.1001.a.effect:0 "Grant all non-[colony|E] [counties|E] held by you in [GetTitleByKey('k_langwell').GetNameNoTier] to local [culture|E] [THIS.Char.GetFaith.GetName] followers."
 gundabad.1001.b.effect:0 "Replace all non-[colony|E] [counties|E] held by non-local [cultures|E] [vassals|E] in [GetTitleByKey('k_langwell').GetNameNoTier] with local [culture|E] [THIS.Char.GetFaith.GetName] followers."
 gundabad.1001.c.effect1:0 "Revoke all [counties|E] held by non-[orc|E] [vassals|E] in [GetTitleByKey('k_langwell').GetNameNoTier]."
 gundabad.1001.c.effect2:0 "All non-[this_char.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip] [culture|E] [counties|E] gain [GetModifier( 'gundabad_ravaged_lands_county_modifier' ).GetNameWithTooltip] for 10 years."
 gundabad.1001.c.effect3:0 "65% chance of non-[this_char.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip] [culture|E] [counties|E] converting to your [culture|E] and [faith|E]."

 gundabad.1011.t:0 "A Dragon's Durability"
 gundabad.1011.desc:0 "During the campaigns to bring the dragon-worshippers of the Grey Mountains under my dominion, many battles were fought and much plunder was had. Ancient banners, rusted weapons aplenty, and not insignificant amounts of silver and gold were found.\n\nYet it is only now that the campaign is ending that we have found a prize truly worthy of my magnificence. While my lackeys were searching through the ancient holds, trying to sniff out any last stragglers, they uncovered an old abandoned warren. While initially deemed of little worth, in its depths was discovered a dragon-shrine. On the alter was laid a great armor, wrought of the shed scales of many [dragons|E], of many brilliant hues.\n\nWhat is this if not a sign that I am destined for true greatness? Another symbol of my great power!"
 gundabad.1011.a:0 "I am the dragon who rules these mountains now!"
 artifact_dragon_armour:0 "Dragonscale Armour"
 artifact_dragon_armour_desc:0 "Wrought by reverent goblin-smiths, this rough yet effective scale mail is made out of shed dragon scales. These scales are hard yet flexible, capable of withstanding blows as well as, or even better than, comparable metal armor. Additionally, it is much lighter than such armor, though obviously far more risky to produce. As such, it is a heavily prized heirloom of the orc or goblins who possess it."
