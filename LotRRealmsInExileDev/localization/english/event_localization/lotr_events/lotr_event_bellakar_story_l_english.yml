 bellakar_story.0101.t: "A Dream of the North"
 bellakar_story.0101.desc: "I once more find myself in a dream, though this is different from the ones I have had of late. I am in a forest, wearing simple clothes but of good make. In the distance I can hear a voice ringing through the trees, as moonlight breaks through the canopy. \n\n"King of [GetTitleByKey('e_bellakar').GetNameNoTier], the hour is nigh, when the fate of the faithful shall be decided at last. The house of Silmalondë shall play its part, as it did once before, but heed well my warning - victory shall come from a hope unseen, and from the north comes the Line of Kings..." \n\nThe starlight grows to blinding levels, yet before it overwhelms me, I can make out a tall, grim figure in the forest canopy. I awaken to find myself in a cold sweat, only able to half-remember what it was I saw."
 bellakar_story.0101.a: "...From the North shall come the Line of the Kings?"
 
 bellakar_story.0102.t: "Heed the Dream?"
 bellakar_story.0102.desc: "Ever since I awoke from that most strange dream, it has haunted my mind. From the North shall come the Line of the Kings? Victory from hope unseen? What kings are these, and what victory shall be won? It would seem that somewhere in the forgotten North, perhaps in the land of [gondor|e], a great war for the fate of this world is to come, and that it will be a northern king that shall bring victory \n\nThe only such kings I can think of are those of our long-ago allies, the house of Elendil. Long has it been since we have had any sort of dealings with the heirs of Elendil, and from what I know, the Stewards now rule in Gondor. Yet the dream remains. Could they need our aid, as once we aided Elendil and fought before the gates of the Dark Lord himself? \n\nYet my own land is not unthreatened - it would alarm my vassals if I should push for a northward expedition on little more than a dream..."
 bellakar_story.0102.a: "Ladnôca has spoken to me, as she once spoke to Zimrêbal himself!"
 bellakar_story.0102.b: "Gondor must fend for itself, whatever should come for it."
 bellakar_northward_focus: "You decide to focus your efforts on renewing contact with the free peoples of the North, hoping to stand as a southern bulwark against the Dark Lord."
 bellakar_southward_focus: "You decide to focus your efforts on the defense and consolidation of the realm, seeking to reclaim your lost hinterlands and destroy the forces of evil to your realm's south."

 isles_corsairs: "Turncoat Corsairs of the Lonely Isles"
 bellakar_story.0103.t: "Law in the Isles"
 bellakar_story.0103.desc: "Thanks to my efforts, the long distracting corsair threat to western [bellakar|e] has, at last, been ended. My well trained men and navies easily overwhelming the disorganised and lawless men that guarded the hidden pirate coves. \n\nYet, the arrival of law and order is not seen so keenly by the locals. The isles are poor, their lands barren and unift for farming or raising beast and livestock. The corsairs and their raids were the only source of wealth in those lands, and nearly the entire economy depended on loot from abroad. I, of course, cannot allow such practices to continue, but if I do not act now the region is sure to fall into utter despair."
 bellakar_story.0103.a: "There is no place for these outlaws!"
 bellakar_story.0103.b: "Perhaps they would join my navy..."
 bellakar_story.0103.a.effects: "You crush every pirate haven and hang any former corsairs who do not comply"
 bellakar_story.0103.b.effects: "You integrate the former corsairs into your naval forces at the cost of gold and dishonnor."
