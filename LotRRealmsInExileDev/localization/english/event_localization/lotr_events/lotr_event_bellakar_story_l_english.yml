 bellakar_story.0101.t: "A Dream of the North"
 bellakar_story.0101.desc: "I once more find myself in a dream, though this is different from the ones I have had of late. I am in a forest, wearing simple clothes but of good make. In the distance I can hear a voice ringing through the trees, as moonlight breaks through the canopy. \n\n"King of bellakar_story, the hour is nigh, when the fate of the faithful shall be decided at last. The house of Silmalondë shall play its part, as it did once before, but heed well my warning - victory shall come from a hope unseen, and from the north comes the Line of Kings..." \n\nThe starlight grows to blinding levels, yet before it overwhelms me, I can make out a tall, grim figure in the forest canopy. I awaken to find myself in a cold sweat, only able to half-remember what it was I saw."
 bellakar_story.0101.a: "...From the North shall come the Line of the Kings?"
 
 bellakar_story.0102.t: "Heed the Dream?"
 bellakar_story.0102.desc: "Ever since I awoke from that most strange dream, I have been thinking about it. Even now, months later, I cannot remove it from my mind. From the North shall come the Line of the Kings? Victory from hope unseen? \n\nWhat kings are these, and what victory shall be won? I think I can understand it means that victory or defeat hangs upon a battle waging in the north and that these kings shall play a vital role. \n\nThe only such kings I can think of are those of our long-ago allies, the house of Elendil. Long has it been since we have had any sort of dealings with the heirs of Elendil, and from what I know, the Stewards now rule in Gondor. Yet the dream remains. Could they need our aid, as once we aided Elendil and fought before the gates of the Dark Lord himself? \n\nYet my own land is not unthreatened - it would alarm my vassals if I should push for a northward expedition on little more than a dream..."
 bellakar_story.0102.a: "Ladnôca has spoken to me, as she once spoke to Zimrêbal himself!"
 bellakar_story.0102.b: "Gondor must fend for itself, whatever should come for it."
