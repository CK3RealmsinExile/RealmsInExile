 daen.0100.t: "Rise of the Mountainfather"
 daen.0100.desc: "I stand atop a steep cliff, overlooking my capital in the vale below. Pride swells within my heart as I take in what my people have accomplished. We, the Men of the Mountains, have banded together as one [kingdom|E] - a feat never accomplished before!\n\nSome have begun to call me the "Mountainfather". I shall bear that name with honour. These lands are ours, and none shall take them from us! I will make sure of that, this I swear."
