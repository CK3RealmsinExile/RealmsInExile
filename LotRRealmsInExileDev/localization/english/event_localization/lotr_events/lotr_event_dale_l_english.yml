 ### DALE ###
 dale.0001.t: "The Council of Dale"
 dale.0001.desc: "The royal council of Dale has convened once again, taking their seats in the Dalekeep's meeting room. Minor topics are discussed until my [chancellor|E], [chancellor.GetName], brings up a more pressing matter.\n\n"My liege," [chancellor.GetSheHe] begins, "Your reign has been effective, and your realm prospers. Our borders extend to the meeting of the rivers Running and Redwater, and trade is flowing. But now, we must look to the future."\n\nA dramatic pause is taken until my chancellor continues. "Rumours have reached my ear from the south, where the realm of [GetTitleByKey('e_golden_realm_rhun').GetNameNoTier] grows in strength. Merchants have begun to fear travelling there, even though the markets of [GetTitleByKey('c_lest').GetNameNoTier] and [GetTitleByKey('c_mistrand').GetNameNoTier] promise high profits. My liege, we stand at a crossroads," [chancellor.GetSheHe] closes, "Do you wish to foster trade further, or is it time to invest in our military, lest the Easterlings become an even greater threat to our hard-won peace?"\n\nSilence befalls the council, and all eyes now rest on me."
 dale.0001.a: "We will promote more trade with our neighbours."
 dale.0001.b: "We must focus on warfare and secure our borders."
 
 dale.0002.t: "A Question of Alliance"
 dale.0002.desc: "After having decided my realm's focus for the coming years, I am approached by my [marshal|E], [marshal.GetName].\n\n"My [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsName], I come to you with an important matter. Our realm is strong, but it could be stronger. Let us look to our neighbors and forge an alliance, just as we did in the past."\n\nI find myself in agreement. An alliance would surely benefit both Dale and her people alike. But which one of our neighbors should we approach?"
 dale.0002.a: "Our oldest allies are the [dwarves|E] of [erebor|E]."
 dale.0002.a.tt:0 "You negotiate an alliance with [ereborholder.GetName]"
 dale.0002.b: "The [elves|E] of [mirkwood|E] are the best choice."
 dale.0002.b.tt: "You negotiate an alliance with [lasgalenholder.GetName]"
 dale.0002.c: "The Framlings beyond [mirkwood|E] are known for their swift horses."
 dale.0002.c.tt:0 "You negotiate an alliance with [framlingholder.GetName]"
 dale.0002.d: "Ferocious are the Sons of Beorn; they would make for mighty allies."
 dale.0002.d.tt:0 "You negotiate an alliance with [beorningholder.GetName]"
 dale.0002.e: "We shall rely on our strength alone."
 
 dale.0003.t: "A Stranger Comes"
 dale.0003.desc: "Late in the evening of a starless night, a hooded rider arrives at the gate of Dale, demanding to speak to the [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsName]. As I arrive, I am greeted by a voice speaking in hushed whispers, but I can understand every single word plainly.\n\nThe rider comes from [mordor|E], seeking the friendship of the Bardings and the Men of Dale. Shivers run down my spine, and I grow suspicious of the stranger, but I let him speak his piece.\n\nThe Lord of the Black Land seeks our aid in finding a hobbit who stole something precious to them: a ring - the least of rings. News of this Halfling would grant us the friendship of Mordor and grant safety to our borders. Refusal was to lead to increased troubles and war...\n\nA shadow fear is upon my heart. I know that I must make a decision swiftly - but which is the correct answer to give?"
 dale.0003.a: "I ask for time to fully consider this offer."
 dale.0003.a.tt: "#I You give no direct answer and will ask the [dwarves|E] of Erebor for their counsel#!"
 dale.0003.b: "I refuse to give aid to the Dark Lord. Begone!"
 dale.0003.b.tt: "#N The Lord of Mordor will remember this#!"
 dale.0003.c: "We shall look for this... least of the rings."
 dale.0003.c.tt: "#N The Lord of Mordor will remember this#!"
 
 dale.0004.t: "The King Under the Mountain"
 dale.0004.desc: "I make my way across a narrow walkway leading up to the throne of Erebor, where [ereborking.GetName] is seated, awaiting my arrival. As I approach, [ereborking.GetSheHe] stands up and walks down the steps from [ereborking.GetHerHis] elevated seat, signifying that we are equals as [king|E]s.\n\nI thank him and convey my reason for coming to the Lonely Mountain in a few quick sentences. The dwarf strokes [ereborking.GetHerHis] beard and nods thoughtfully.\n\n"You were wise to seek my counsel, trusted friend," [ereborking.GetFirstName] states. "The Dark One from the Land of Shadows is not to be trusted. He has sent his messengers not only to you but to me as well. I have turned them away twice now, giving no answer to the demands. Instead, I plan to send messages to Elrond Half-elven, wisest of the Lords of the West. This ring the Dark Lord seeks... I deem it is far more than simply "the least of rings." There must be a reason why he desires it so."\n\nI am left reassured by the wise words of the King Under the Mountain. Perhaps I should follow suit and send a missive to the Lord of Rivendell as well?"
 dale.0004.a: "I will dispatch a messenger to Elrond Half-elven."
 dale.0004.a.tt: "The Lord of Rivendell will receive your message in time"
 dale.0004.b: "Thank you for your counsel, wise king."
 dale.0004.b.tt: "You will return to Dale, for now"
 
 dale.0005.t: "A New Loke-kan Rises"
 dale.0005.desc: "Travelling merchants from [dorwinion|E] bring news of an important event in the distant [GetTitleByKey('e_golden_realm_rhun').GetNameNoTier]. The current ruler has died, and a new Loke-kan has been chosen. The circumstances of his predecessor's demise are shrouded in mystery, but I wouldn't be surprised if [margoz.GetName], his successor, had something to do with it. The merchants speak with concern about this man who now lords over the Easterlings. He is a warlike and sadistic individual. If the rumours borne to my ear are true, [margoz.GetFirstName] enjoys torturing his enemies in secret...\n\nI am left uneasy at this news from the southeast. If the Golden Realm were to bring war to our borders, our defenses may not hold unless we begin preparations immediately..."
 dale.0005.a: "This cannot be good..."
 
 dale.0006.t: "Messages from Dale"
 dale.0006.desc: "An exhausted dignitary arrives late in the evening, having crossed the High Pass with great difficulty. It is a messenger of [daleking.GetName], bearing ill news.\n\nA herald of [mordor|E] has come to Dale, requesting the Dalemen's aid in the search for the One - of that, I have little doubt. The description of the messenger sent from the Black Land gives me pause. Could it be one of the Nine, long thought to be vanished from this world? A troubling development indeed.\n\n"Bring this message to your liege, friend," I instruct the Dalish dignitary. "I advise you to reject this demand from Mordor and remain true to your alliance with the [dwarves|E]. They will be able to aid you in the coming days."\n\nI grant the messenger leave to rest in Imladris until their strength returns and my counsel can be borne back to Dale."
 dale.0006.a: "The Shadow of [mordor|E] is spreading..."
 
 dale.0007.t: "Lord Elrond's Counsel"
 dale.0007.desc: "Many days have passed since I decided to send a messenger to the distant refuge of Rivendell, far beyond the [mistymountains|E]. Today the man has returned from his arduous journey to the west.\n\nHe bears a reply from [elrond.GetName], who is called the Half-elven. "Heed not the demands of [mordor|E]," he relays to me, "for the Dark Lord does not share his friendship without great cost. You would forsake the friendship of the [dwarves|E] of Erebor as well as that of all [elves|E], and be left defenseless should a new threat arise to the south. I bid you stay true to the ways of the Free Peoples of [middleearth|E] and send the messenger of the Black Land away."\n\nWhile I am grateful for the Elf-lord's counsel, I do not look forward to denying the dark stranger that will soon return to my gates..."
 dale.0007.a: "Lord Elrond is wise indeed, but I dread angering the dark messenger..."
 
 dale.1000.t: "The Fall of Dale"
 dale.1000.desc:0 "Our defences are overcome! The proud city of Dale has fallen, and its people flee to the safety of the Lonely Mountain.\n\nWe cannot let this tragedy stand! Let us gather what armies and allies we can still call upon and retake our proud city ere our enemies raze or corrupt her!\n\nDale shall rise again..."
 dale.1000.a: "I will reverse this tragic fate!"
 
 dale.1001.t: "Dale Reclaimed"
 dale.1001.desc: "The day has finally come: Dale, proud center of the Realm of the Dalemen, has been restored to its rightful place.\n\nMany hardships have we endured and suffered much fear and doubt, but it was all worth it. With strength of arms and unbreakable will, we have achieved victory, seizing the city of Dale from the clutches of her vile tormentors and setting her free again.\n\nLet no foe ever conquer Dale again!"
 dale.1001.a: "I shall defend Dale until my death!"
 
 dale.2000.t: "Dale's Northern Expansion"
 dale.2000.desc: "Long before the dragon ever came to [erebor|E], men have settled in the fertile plains north of the Lonely Mountain. When Smaug rose, he devastated those lands, leaving behind an uninhabitable wasteland. But since the Dragon's end, the grass has regrown and Men have come to live here once more.\n\nWith the establishment of adequate castles throughout Drakkenvast, I can now proclaim this land as rightfully part of the Kingdom of Dale."
 dale.2000.a: "Our northernmost frontier stands strong."
 
 dale.2001.t: "The Carnen Fortified"
 dale.2001.desc: "The Kingdom of Dale has seen swift expansion in the years since the Slaying of Smaug at the hands of Bard the Bowman. Just a couple of generations after its establishment, its borders came to extend to the confluence of the rivers Carnen and Celduin. Here, they have stood watch against the east.\n\nThe Carnen has many crossings, but now each of them is fortified and well-guarded. Whenever the easterling hordes approach, we shall be ready for them."
 dale.2001.a: "Our defenses give us strength."
 
 dale.2002.t: "Horse-archers of the Plains"
 dale.2002.desc: "The Logath are a semi-nomadic people who have dwelt on our eastern borders for many generations. With our efforts to gain insights into their fighting styles successful, we can now freely recruit skilled riders who excel at wielding bows directly from the saddle!"
 dale.2002.a: "A useful weapon added to our arsenal."
 
 dale.2003.t: "The Reclamation of Erebor"
 dale.2003.desc: "I stand on the steps outside the imposing gate of [erebor|E], now once more a mighty bastion of the stout [dwarves|E]. Beside me is [ereborholder.GetName]. A single tear runs down his face, disappearing beneath the dwarf's beard. "No words in your language or mine own can express the gratitude my people and I have for what you have done, my friend," [ereborholder.GetFirstName] says, his voice filled with respect. "You are a true friend of Durin's Folk, and we shall aid you in any way we can. And once more, all is well between Mountain and Lake."\n\nI look out across the vale before me, where the city of Dale stands. With the dwarves at our side once again, the Dale-lands shall prosper."
 dale.2003.a: "May the line of Durin last until the end of all days!"
 
 dale.2010.t: "The Restoration of Rhovanion"
 dale.2010.desc: "The people of [rhovanion|E], long divived, must unite. Once, we were scattered to the winds by many foes. Beset from all sides, our ancestors were driven north, and west; some crossing the [mirkwood|E] into the [anduinvale|E]; others enduring in hidden enclaves upon the plains - diminished scions of a noble kingdom. But no more!\n\nI have secured the legacy of Rhovanion and united my people, reclaiming all the glory that was lost. I set out to rebuild the ancient capital of Rhovanion and ensure that no foe shall ever march unfought upon these plains we call our home."
 dale.2010.a: "Forth, Riders of Rhovanion!"
 
 dale.2011.t: "The United Plains"
 dale.2011.desc: "I step out onto the plains. A cozy breeze whispers across the wide open fields of grass as my loyal steed follows me. I take a deep breath and turn around. "We've come a long way, haven't we," I whisper before climbing into the saddle.\n\nAs I draw my sword, the thunder of a thousand hooves can be heard. My riders pass before me, assembling into a mighty host. The host of Rhovanion - a realm reborn. Reforged. Reunited.\n\nThe people of the plains are assembled under a single banner. With our ancestral capital at [GetTitleByKey('c_alcisbaurg').GetNameNoTier] restored, none can deny that the splendor of Rhovanion has been returned."
 dale.2011.a: "May this realm prosper until this world is ended."
 dale.2011.b: "Rhovanion is saved, now and forever."
