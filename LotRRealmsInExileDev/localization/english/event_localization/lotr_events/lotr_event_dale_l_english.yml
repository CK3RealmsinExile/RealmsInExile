 dale.0001.t:0 "The Council of Dale"
 dale.0001.desc:0 "The royal council of Dale has convened once again, taking their seats in the Dalekeep's meeting room. Minor topics are discussed until my [chancellor|E], [chancellor.GetName], brings up a more pressing matter.\n\n"My liege," [chancellor.GetSheHe] begins, "Your reign has been effective and your realm prospers. Our borders extend to the meeting of the rivers Running and Redwater, and trade is flowing. But now, we must look to the future."\n\nA dramatic pause is taken until my chancellor continues. "Rumours have reached my ear from the south, where the realm of [GetTitleByKey('e_golden_realm_rhun').GetNameNoTier] grows in strength. Merchants have begun to fear travelling there, even though the markets of [GetTitleByKey('c_lest').GetNameNoTier] and [GetTitleByKey('c_mistrand').GetNameNoTier] promise high profits. My liege, we stand at a crossroads," [chancellor.GetSheHe] closes, "Do you wish to foster trade further, or is it time to invest in our military, lest the Easterlings become an even greater threat to our hard-won peace?"\n\nSilence befalls the council, and all eyes now rest on me."
