They talk of the rising shadow in [dolguldur|E], and offer us protection and guidance in our struggle against this threat. However, many of my clan are suspicious of this messenger - were they truly sent by [foldewyncharacter|E]?\n\nIf we become subjects of the Fae, we could reignite my clans' ancient [claim|E] to [GetTitleByKey('d_drownholt').GetNameNoTier]!

Dark words have we heard from Drownholt as of late, of terrible deeds and sacrifice done in the name of their new god." \n\nFurthermore, [parthruler.GetSheHe] explained that a few generations ago, [parthruler.GetHerHis] people still dwelled in [GetTitleByKey('d_drownholt').GetNameNoTier], until the clans split after a succession dispute and they were forced to cross the [anduin|E].\n\nAs word spreads that I, the Radiant Lady, have become their patron, the Guthmunding Clan's claim has strengthened again and they wish to reclaim their ancient homestead that has fallen to the Shadow.

But by this marriage she chooses the Gift of [men|E], and will be forever sundered from me."

Long have we fought the long defeat, our folk dwindling, our Silvan kin fleeing north, the [greenwood|E] decaying into a dark and foetid place, haunted by evil beasts and the cruel minions of [dolguldur|E]. Now, at least, the darkness has lifted. The fortress of [khamul|E] has been thrown down, and its dungeons opened to the sky, and the corruption that it spread has finally been dispelled.\n\nA great part of our own folk have now removed there, wandering the forest and tending to it, bringing light and song back to the Wood of Greenleaves. For a time, however short, it shall be proclaimed a part of the Kingdom of [lorien|E], and receive our blessing and protection.

 elven.0800.desc:0 "Once, [ostinedhil|E] was a beacon of Noldorin knowledge, a dream made manifest to build realms fair, free, and open to all. Yet its welcome became its doom, for [sauroncharacter|E] came and deceived the Gwaith-i-Mírdain, and through them the [ringsofpower|E] came to be. They refused to surrender the [threeringsofelves|E], perceiving Sauron’s designs at the last, and so war came to [eregion|E], and the City of the [eldar|E], [GetTitleByKey('c_ost_in_edhil').GetNameNoTier], was laid to ruin.\n\nSince then, none have dwelled in the ruins, for the sorrows and the pain of the fall permeate the very earth. But now there is a change. [elves|E] have come once more to the fallen city, and with time and toil the wounds of the land have been knitted shut once more. Halls have been raised anew, a powerful testament to the resilience of spirit and a triumph of hope over despair.\n\nAnd all know that this is the result of my leadership. Beneath my hand, the land of the Jewelsmiths have been reborn, and the scars of Sauron’s sins healed. Let the bells ring once more across the land - for the sun shall never fade, and night must give way to day. Let us dance, laugh, and love, for we live!"

 elven.0801.desc:0 "In the [secondage|E], the Sîrrandrai [elves|E] of [GetTitleByKey('k_sirgala').GetNameNoTier] once wandered across much of [eriador|E], but the greatest part of their people dwelled between the Baranduin and the southern [eredluin|E]. They were little experienced in warfare, and awed by the glory of the [elves|E] of the West, they sought close ties to them, swearing fealty to the new kingdom of [lindon|E] and High-King Gil-galad.\n\nYet though they heard the tales, none could prepare them for the depravity of [sauroncharacter|E], and in the [waroftheelvesandsauron|E], their land was scorched and their people slaughtered. [dunedain|E] increasingly came and settled the land, and by the end of the Second Age it was elven only in name. Thus it seemed the Sîrrandrai, and Sîrgala, were doomed to fade into memory and myth, particularly after the land was ceded to [elendil|E].\n\nYet fate turns oddly. With the fall of the Kingdom of [arnor|E], the ancient lands of the Sîrrandrai were once more without a master. Now, I have led us once more to these lands, and have reclaimed Sîrgala in the name of the Elves. Let us flee no more - we shall reclaim the lands lost to the cruelty of Sauron!"
 elven.0801.a:0 "Sîrgala shall never fall again!"

 elven.0802.t:0 "A New High-King"
 elven.0802.desc:0 "For many years, the [noldorelves|E] have had no High-king. It seemed that there was no need for one, for our age was ending, and we departed this shore. Yet it seems the tasks of the Noldor are not yet done, and the world still requires the strength of the High-kings.\n\nAfter conclaving the Noldor of the West and meeting with Cirdan, I have taken up the throne, to provide leadership unquestioned in this time of lengthening shadow. Lindon slowly rouses itself from its long slumber, yet it remains a shadow of what once it was. Though perhaps some may be sceptical of the decision, most agree with the decision and my crowning. For the time to come, we shall need the valour of [fingolfin|E], the ingenuity of [feanor|E], and the wisdom of Gil-galad to weather the dark."
