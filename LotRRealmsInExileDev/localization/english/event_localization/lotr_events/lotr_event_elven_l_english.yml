 elven.0150.desc:0 "This morning, a stranger arrived in my home. They introduced themselves as a messenger of the Radiant Lady, an emissary of the Fey Court! They talk of the rising shadow in [dolguldur|E], and offer us protection and guidance in our struggle against this threat. However, many of my clan are suspicious of this messenger - were they truly sent by [foldewyncharacter|E]?\n\nIf we become subjects of the Fae, we could reignite my clans' ancient [claim|E] to [GetTitleByKey('d_drownholt').GetNameNoTier]! It falls upon me to decide the fate of my people."
 elven.0150.a:0 "We shall thank the Radiant Lady for her protection."
 elven.0150.att:0 "You will travel to [dwimordene|E] and thank her for her protection."
 elven.0150.b:0 "We are a hardy people, we can endure the shadow on our own."
 elven.0150.btt:0 "You decline the Radiant Lady's offer and lead your people independently."
 
 elven.0151.t:0 "The Leofrings bow"
 elven.0151.desc:0 "My envoys return from the Leofrings' lands to the south, bearing good news. The rulers of Leofr's Folk have chosen wisely and sworn fealty to the Radiant Lady of [dwimordene|E], as they now name me.\n\nWith the backing of the Golden Wood, they are now free to convince their brethren dwelling upon the eastern shores of the [anduin|E] to follow suit, if they wish."
 elven.0151.a:0 "A noble decision."
 
 elven.0152.t:0 "The Leofrings won't bow"
 elven.0152.desc:0 "My envoys return from the Leofrings' lands to the south, bearing ill news. The rulers of Leofr's Folk have decided to reject our gracious offer of allegiance and wish to remain independent. \n\nIt is a pity, for surely we could have taught them much and shielded them against the shadow that now rises in the east."
 elven.0152.a:0 "I wished only for their protection. Alas."
 
 elven.0153.t:0 "The Men of Celebrant pledge their Allegiance."
 elven.0153.desc:0 "Today, a [parthruler.GetWomanMan] arrived at my court. [parthruler.GetSheHe] introduced [parthruler.GetHerselfHimself] as [parthruler.GetFullName], Clanleader of the [northmen|E] of Parth Celebrant. \n\n"I came to [dwimordene|E] to personally express my gratitude for your protection against the Shadow. Dark words have we heard from Drownholt as of late, of terrible deeds and sacrifice done in the name of their new god." \n\nFurthermore, [parthruler.GetSheHe] explained that a few generations ago, [parthruler.GetHerHis] people still dwelled in [GetTitleByKey('d_drownholt').GetNameNoTier], until the clans split after a succession dispute and they were forced to cross the [anduin|E].\n\nAs word spreads that I, the Radiant Lady, have become their patron, the Guthmunding Clan's claim has strengthened again and they wish to reclaim their ancient homestead that has fallen to the Shadow. Despite being few in number, their people have found new hope and are eager to fight."
 elven.0153.a:0 "Together, we can drive back the Darkness."
 
 elven.0101.t:0 "A Royal Wedding"
 elven.0101.desc:0 "When my dear friend [mithrandircharacter|E] gave me the Elessar, he prophesied that I would be but a caretaker for it, and that it would eventually pass to one who would take the name Elfstone.\n\nI foresaw this day in my mirror, when my grand-daughter would fulfill her destiny and marry [aragorn.GetFirstName].\n\nIt is a bittersweet day for me: [arwen.GetFirstName] is visibly happy, her beauty more radiant than ever, a living image of Lúthien of old. But by this marriage she chooses the Gift of [men|E], and will be forever sundered from me."
 elven.0101.a:0 "As was foretold, the Elfstone will go to Elessar"
 elven.0101.b:0 "I cannot bring myself to part with it."
 
 elven.0102.t:0 "A Royal Wedding"
 elven.0102.desc:0 "Lady Galadriel rode in with Arwen for the wedding celebration in [minastirith|E]. When her turn comes to congratulate us, she gives me the Elfstone, the green Elessar of prophecy. With it I will heal my suffering people."
 elven.0102.a:0 "This is a royal gift!"

 elven.0300.desc:0 "The smell of burning #italic mallorn !# trees lies heavily on the air. [lorien|E], the elven realm of the Golden Wood, has been mortally wounded. \n\nOur foes have overcome both our defences and the ancient protection placed upon this land by the Lady of the Galadhrim, and have taken our treetop city, burning and plundering as they please. \n\nThose of our folk who did not fall in the fighting are put to flight, dispersed into the mallorn woods surrounding the burning ruins..."
 elven.0300.a:0 "So falls the heart of elvendom on earth..."
 
 elven.0301.t:0 "Our Elven Heart Rekindled"
 elven.0301.desc:0 "Songs of victory can be hear from the treetops all around, and a great joy fills the land. Caras Galadhon, the ruling seat of [lorien|E], has been reclaimed by our people. \n\nNow, the Galadhrim will see to the arduous labour of restoring the fallen city to its former splendor. Trees must be replanted, and hedges be regrown. It will not be an easy nor swift process, but we will see it through."
 elven.0301.a:0 "Caras Galadhon shall be renewed."

 elven.0700.desc:0 "Long have we gazed across the [anduin|E], battling in thought with the malevolent occupants of the Hill of Sorcery. Long have we fought the long defeat, our folk dwindling, our Silvan kin fleeing north, the [greenwood|E] decaying into a dark and foetid place, haunted by evil beasts and the cruel minions of [dolguldur|E]. Now, at least, the darkness has lifted. The fortress of [khamul|E] has been thrown down, and its dungeons opened to the sky, and the corruption that it spread has finally been dispelled.\n\nA great part of our own folk have now removed there, wandering the forest and tending to it, bringing light and song back to the Wood of Greenleaves. For a time, however short, it shall be proclaimed a part of the Kingdom of [lorien|E], and receive our blessing and protection. When our people finally leave Middle Earth, those who come after us will find a hallowed land."
 elven.0700.a:0 "Let the name [mirkwood|E] be forgotten forever"

 elven.0800.t:0 "Ost-in-Edhil Reborn"
 elven.0800.desc:0 "Once, [ostinedhil|E] was a beacon of Noldorin knowledge, a dream made manifest to build realms fair, free, and open to all. Yet its welcome became its doom, for [sauroncharacter|E] came and deceived the Gwaith-i-Mírdain, and through them the [ringsofpower|E] came to be. They refused to surrender the [threeringsofelves|E], perceiving Sauron’s designs at the last, and so war came to [eregion|E], and the City of the [eldar|E], [GetTitleByKey('c_ost_in_edhil').GetNameNoTier], was laid to ruin.\n\nSince then, none have dwelled in the ruins, for the sorrows and the pain of the fall permeate the very earth. But now there is a change. [elves|E] have come once more to the fallen city, and with time and toil the wounds of the land have been knitted shut once more. Halls have been raised anew, a powerful testament to the resilience of spirit and a triumph of hope over despair.\n\nAnd all know that this is the result of my leadership. Beneath my hand, the land of the Jewelsmiths have been reborn, and the scars of Sauron’s sins healed. Let the bells ring once more across the land - for the sun shall never fade, and night must give way to day. Let us dance, laugh, and love, for we live!"
 elven.0800.a:0 "Let us be a beacon for all the ages."

 elven.0801.t:0 "The Realm of Sîrgala"
 elven.0801.desc:0 "In the [secondage|E], the Sîrrandrai [elves|E] of [GetTitleByKey('k_sirgala').GetNameNoTier] once wandered across much of [eriador|E], but the greatest part of their people dwelled between the Baranduin and the southern [eredluin|E]. They were little experienced in warfare, and awed by the glory of the [elves|E] of the West, they sought close ties to them, swearing fealty to the new kingdom of [lindon|E] and High-King Gil-galad.\n\nYet though they heard the tales, none could prepare them for the depravity of [sauroncharacter|E], and in the [waroftheelvesandsauron|E], their land was scorched and their people slaughtered. [dunedain|E] increasingly came and settled the land, and by the end of the Second Age it was elven only in name. Thus it seemed the Sîrrandrai, and Sîrgala, were doomed to fade into memory and myth, particularly after the land was ceded to [elendil|E].\n\nYet fate turns oddly. With the fall of the Kingdom of [arnor|E], the ancient lands of the Sîrrandrai were once more without a master. Now, I have led us once more to these lands, and have reclaimed Sîrgala in the name of the Elves. Let us flee no more - we shall reclaim the lands lost to the cruelty of Sauron!"
 elven.0801.a:0 "Sîrgala shall never fall again!"

 elven.0802.t:0 "A New High-King"
 elven.0802.desc:0 "For many years, the [noldorelves|E] have had no High-king. It seemed that there was no need for one, for our age was ending, and we departed this shore. Yet it seems the tasks of the Noldor are not yet done, and the world still requires the strength of the High-kings.\n\nAfter conclaving the Noldor of the West and meeting with Cirdan, I have taken up the throne, to provide leadership unquestioned in this time of lengthening shadow. Lindon slowly rouses itself from its long slumber, yet it remains a shadow of what once it was. Though perhaps some may be sceptical of the decision, most agree with the decision and my crowning. For the time to come, we shall need the valour of [fingolfin|E], the ingenuity of [feanor|E], and the wisdom of Gil-galad to weather the dark."
 elven.0802.a:0 "Heavy is the head that bears the crown."

  elven.2100.t:0 "Proclamation of the Herald of Valinor"
  elven.2100.desc:0 "Out of the west they come. From beyond the bent seas and the broken world, a fleet great and terrible has come. Their banners are bright and manifold, their armor radiant as the dawn. Their swords ancient and sharp, their arrows fly beyond the horizon. At their helm stands [eonwecharacter|E], herald of [manwecharactershort|E], and he speaks with the voice of the Elder King, vice-regent of [eaworld|E]. In his hands is both banner and blade, lightning made manifest to bring judgement upon the mortal lands.\n\nHis voice is carried on the winds of his master, strong and clear. All but the most depraved flinch at its thundering, as it passes through the plains and in the deeps of mountain passes. The darkness is set to flight by its passing. And his voice is answered by his host, trumpets of silver and gold proclaiming their coming.\n\nIt is a summons. A summon once more to war, to rally again to the banner-bearer of Manwë and the forces of the [undyinglands|E]. A summon to labor together, until the [Concept('sauroncharacter','darkness')|E] is once more banished from these lands and they be made free. A summons to all people fair and free."
  elven.2100.a:0 "To the banner of the Elder King!"
