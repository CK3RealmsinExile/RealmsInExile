 elven.0150.t: "An Envoy of the Fae"
 elven.0150.desc: "This morning, a stranger arrived in my home. They introduced themselves as a messenger of the Radiant Lady, an emissary of the Fey Court! They talk of the rising shadow in [dolguldur|E] and offer us protection and guidance in our struggle against this threat. However, many of my clan are suspicious of this messenger - were they truly sent by [foldewyncharacter|E]?\n\nIf we become subjects of the Fae, we could reignite my clans' ancient [claim|E] to [GetTitleByKey('d_drownholt').GetNameNoTier]! It falls upon me to decide the fate of my people."
 elven.0150.a: "We shall thank the Radiant Lady for her protection."
 elven.0150.att: "You will become a protectorate of the Lady of the [dwimordene|E]."
 elven.0150.c: "We shall thank the Radiant Lady for her protection."
 elven.0150.c.tt: "You will travel to [dwimordene|E] and thank her for her protection."

 elven.0151.t: "The Leofrings Bow"
 elven.0151.desc: "My envoys return from the Leofrings' lands to the south, bearing good news. The rulers of Leofr's Folk have chosen wisely and sworn fealty to the Radiant Lady of [dwimordene|E], as they now name me.\n\nWith the backing of the Golden Wood, they are now free to convince their brethren dwelling upon the eastern shores of the [anduin|E] to follow suit, if they wish."
 elven.0151.a: "A noble decision."
 elven.0151.a.tt: "The Leofrings became your protectorate"
 
 elven.0152.t: "The Leofrings Refuse"
 elven.0152.desc: "My envoys return from the Leofrings' lands to the south, bearing ill news. The rulers of Leofr's Folk have decided to reject our gracious offer of allegiance and wish to remain independent. \n\nIt is a pity, for surely we could have taught them much and shielded them against the shadow that now rises in the east."
 elven.0152.a: "I wished only for their protection. Alas."
 
 elven.0153.t: "The Men of Celebrant pledge their Allegiance."
 elven.0153.desc: "Today, a [parthruler.GetWomanMan] arrived at my court. [parthruler.GetSheHe] introduced [parthruler.GetHerselfHimself] as [parthruler.GetFullName], Clan leader of the [northmen|E] of Parth Celebrant. \n\n"I came to [dwimordene|E] to personally express my gratitude for your protection against the Shadow. Dark words have we heard from Drownholt as of late, of terrible deeds and sacrifice done in the name of their new god." \n\nFurthermore, [parthruler.GetSheHe] explained that a few generations ago, [parthruler.GetHerHis] people still dwelt in [GetTitleByKey('d_drownholt').GetNameNoTier], until the clans split after a succession dispute and they were forced to cross the [anduin|E].\n\nAs word spreads that I, the Radiant Lady, have become their patron, the Guthmunding Clan's claim has strengthened again, and they wish to reclaim their ancient homestead that has fallen to the Shadow. Despite being few in number, their people have found new hope and are eager to fight."
 elven.0153.a: "Together, we can drive back the Darkness."
 elven.0153.a.tt: "The Leofrings became your protectorate"
 
 elven.0154.t: "The Looming Shadow"
 elven.0154.desc: "With my southern borders secured and guarded by the faithful Leofrings led by [parthruler.GetName], my thoughts turn towards the east. Across the great [anduin|E] river lie the lowlands of the [GetTitleByKey('d_drownholt').GetNameNoTier], where Men have dwelt for a while now.\n\nBeyond lie the dark boughs of the [mirkwood|E] where upon Amon Lanc stands the dark fastness of [dolguldur|E]. An evil once inhabitated these ruins, until the White Council drove it from its seat, but in recent years, the darkness has returned.\n\nIf we are to hold back the growing shadows, we must aid the Men of Parth Celebrant so they may claim the Drownholt for themselves, denying the eastern banks of the river to the enemy..."
 elven.0154.a: "Summon the Golden Host. We cross the Anduin!"
 elven.0154.b: "There are still preparations to be completed."
 elven.0154.b.tt: "Unlocks a [decision|E] to cross the Anduin at a later time"
 
 elven.0101.t: "A Royal Wedding"
 elven.0101.desc: "When my dear friend [mithrandircharacter|E] gave me the Elessar, he prophesied that I would be but a caretaker for it and that it would eventually pass to one who would take the name Elfstone.\n\nI foresaw this day in my mirror, when my granddaughter would fulfill her destiny and marry [aragorn.GetFirstName].\n\nIt is a bittersweet day for me: [arwen.GetFirstName] is visibly happy, her beauty more radiant than ever, a living image of Lúthien of old. But by this marriage she chooses the Gift of [men|E], and will be forever sundered from me."
 elven.0101.a: "As was foretold, the Elfstone will go to Elessar"
 elven.0101.b: "I cannot bring myself to part with it."
 
 elven.0102.t: "A Royal Wedding"
 elven.0102.desc: "Lady Galadriel rode in with Arwen for the wedding celebration in [minastirith|E]. When her turn comes to congratulate us, she gives me the Elfstone, the green Elessar of prophecy. With it I will heal my suffering people."
 elven.0102.a: "This is a royal gift!"
 
 elven.0104.t: "Verses of Admiration"
 elven.0104.desc: "As I walk across the venue, I come across [wedding_attending_elf.GetName], who is beaming with sheer happiness. "Isn't this the most joyous occasion of the century? No, what am I saying... the most joyous event of the age!"\n\n[wedding_attending_elf.GetFirstName]'s happiness is infectious, and I smile in great mirth. "This should be chronicled in verse," I think to myself, quickly producing a scroll and quill from my belongings. But what should I focus on for a poem like this?"
 elven.0104.a: "A poem in memory of this hopeful occasion."
 elven.0104.b: "A poem showcasing my skills with the written word."

 elven.0200.desc: "As my party begins to set up camp for the night, a sudden movement in the shadows to the side catches my eye. Drawing my blade, I whirl around, ready to face the new threat, but out from the shadows steps no foe, but three familiar faces.\n\n"Hail, Eltariel," the newcomers greet me, "And well met indeed. The Lady sent us to seek you out, to offer aid in your quest should you require it."\n\n[rumilien.GetFirstName], [mirwen.GetFirstName], and [cuilebeth.GetFirstName] are well-respected among the Galadhrim, and would be more than capable of lending me a hand in my hunts. But on the other hand, two hunting parties could cover a larger area than just one..."

[lorien|E], the elven realm of the Golden Wood, has been mortally wounded. \n\nOur foes have overcome both our defences and the ancient protection placed upon this land by the Lady of the Galadhrim and have taken our treetop city, burning and plundering as they please. \n\nThose of our folk who did not fall in the fighting are put to flight, dispersed into the mallorn woods surrounding the burning ruins..."

Caras Galadhon, the ruling seat of [lorien|E], has been reclaimed by our people. \n\nNow, the Galadhrim will see to the arduous labour of restoring the fallen city to its former splendor.

 elven.0700.desc: "Long have we gazed across the [anduin|E], battling in thought with the malevolent occupants of the Hill of Sorcery. Long have we fought the long defeat, our folk dwindling, our Silvan kin fleeing north, the [greenwood|E] decaying into a dark and foetid place, haunted by evil beasts and the cruel minions of [dolguldur|E]. Now, at least, the darkness has lifted. The fortress of [khamul|E] has been thrown down, and its dungeons opened to the sky, and the corruption that it spread has finally been dispelled.\n\nA great part of our own folk have now removed there, wandering the forest and tending to it, bringing light and song back to the Wood of Greenleaves. For a time, however short, it shall be proclaimed a part of the Kingdom of [lorien|E] and receive our blessing and protection. When our people finally leave Middle-earth, those who come after us will find a hallowed land."

The necromancer's realm will not be taken easily - but take it we must nonetheless, for the good of all free peoples of [rhovanion|E].\n\nLet [khamul|E] tremble on his dark seat, for the fury of the Elves is upon him! Let the walls of Dol Guldur crumble and its pits be laid bare!"
 elven.0701.a: "Let us cross the Anduin in strength."
 
 # Decision Events
 elven.0800.t: "Ost-in-Edhil Reborn"
 elven.0800.desc: "Once, [ostinedhil|E] was a beacon of Noldorin knowledge, a dream made manifest to build realms fair, free, and open to all. Yet its welcome became its doom, for [sauroncharacter|E] came and deceived the Gwaith-i-Mírdain, and through them the [ringsofpower|E] came to be. They refused to surrender the [threeringsofelves|E], perceiving Sauron’s designs at the last, and so war came to [eregion|E] and the City of the [eldar|E], [GetTitleByKey('c_ost_in_edhil').GetNameNoTier], was laid to ruin.\n\nSince then, none have dwelled in the ruins, for the sorrows and the pain of the fall permeate the very earth. But now there is a change. [elves|E] have come once more to the fallen city, and with time and toil the wounds of the land have been knitted shut once more. Halls have been raised anew, a powerful testament to the resilience of spirit and a triumph of hope over despair.\n\nAnd all know that this is the result of my leadership. Beneath my hand, the land of the Jewelsmiths has been reborn, and the scars of Sauron’s sins healed. Let the bells ring once more across the land - for the sun shall never fade, and night must give way to day. Let us dance, laugh, and love, for we live!"
 elven.0800.a: "Let us be a beacon for all the ages."

 elven.0801.t: "The Realm of Sîrgala"
 elven.0801.desc: "In the [secondage|E], the Sîrrandrai [elves|E] of [GetTitleByKey('k_sirgala').GetNameNoTier] once wandered across much of [eriador|E], but the greatest part of their people dwelled between the Baranduin and the southern [eredluin|E]. They were little experienced in warfare, and awed by the glory of the [elves|E] of the West, they sought close ties to them, swearing fealty to the new kingdom of [lindon|E] and High-King Gil-galad.\n\nYet though they heard the tales, none could prepare them for the depravity of [sauroncharacter|E], and in the [waroftheelvesandsauron|E], their land was scorched and their people slaughtered. The [dunedain|E] increasingly came and settled the land, and by the end of the Second Age, it was elven only in name. Thus it seemed the Sîrrandrai and Sîrgala were doomed to fade into memory and myth, particularly after the land was ceded to [elendil|E].\n\nYet fate turns oddly. With the fall of the Kingdom of [arnor|E], the ancient lands of the Sîrrandrai were once more without a master. Now, I have led us once more to these lands and have reclaimed Sîrgala in the name of the Elves. Let us flee no more - we shall reclaim the lands lost to the cruelty of Sauron!"
 elven.0801.a: "Sîrgala shall never fall again!"

 elven.0802.t: "A New High-King"
 elven.0802.desc: "For many years, the [noldorelves|E] have had no High-king. It seemed that there was no need for one, for our age was ending, and we departed this shore. Yet it seems the tasks of the Noldor are not yet done, and the world still requires the strength of the High-kings.\n\nAfter conclaving the Noldor of the West and meeting with Círdan, I have taken up the throne to provide leadership unquestioned in this time of lengthening shadow. Lindon slowly rouses itself from its long slumber, yet it remains a shadow of what once it was. Though perhaps some may be sceptical of the decision, most agree with the decision and my crowning. For the time to come, we shall need the valour of [fingolfin|E], the ingenuity of [feanor|E], and the wisdom of Gil-galad to weather the dark."
 elven.0802.a: "Heavy is the head that bears the crown."
 
 elven.0803.t: "The Bounds of Sîrgala"
 elven.0803.desc: "After countless years, the ancient boundaries of Sîrgala, as it was before the [waroftheelvesandsauron|E], have been restored. Though the Elves still remain much diminished and fewer than they were in those days, this resurgence is a sign that not all need be decline. From the ashes, new growth comes, and all the faster if there are gardeners to tend it."
 elven.0803.a: "The time has come for flowers to bloom anew."
 
 elven.0804.t: "The Oaken Hall of Bornmîr"
 elven.0804.desc: "Though rustic compared to the halls of the [noldorelves|E], the royal seat of the King of the Sirrandrai, the hall of Bornmîr, was not without its own charm. Wrought of mighty cedars and oaks, the woodwork that composed the hall were testaments to the fact that requires no less skill to work in wood than in stone. Sadly, it was lost to the foul orc hosts of Sauron in the [waroftheelvesandsauron|E], and none had the heart to rebuild it again.\n\nYet now it rises anew by our hands, no less skilled than those that came before. Let it be a symbol of our people and their ability to rise again, despite the sorrow and the pain."
 elven.0804.a: "A king he was, on carven throne, in many pillared wooden hall..."
 
 elven.0805.t: "The Restored Patrimony"
 elven.0805.desc: "The [secondage|E] was in many ways the apex of many — the [numenoreans|E], the [dwarves|E] of [khazaddum|E], and the [elves|E] of the [westlands|E]. Mightiest of all the lords of the Eldar was Gil-galad, whose power at its apex was said to extend even to the eves of [greenwood|E].\n\nFor much of the Second Age, Gil-galad acted as suzerain for much of [eriador|E], keeping the peace and functioning as final recourse for arbitration in disputes among the many peoples of the region. When travelers walked, they could do so under the assumption that the King's Law would keep the peace, regardless of the local lords, be they Men or Elves.\n\nWith the growing power of the [dunedain|E] colonists, more and more of the region fell into legal grey areas - subjects of the Númenórean crown, yet dwelling on lands traditionally considered part of Gil-galad’s dominion. It would only be with the coming of [elendil|E] and the establishment of [arnor|E] that this legal quagmire would be resolved, with Gil-galad officially relinquishing his authority over all non-Elves in the region to his friend. \n\nYet with Arnor having waned and the Elves reasserting their power in the region, Gil-galad’s old patrimony has now been restored. The High-King of the Elves of the West is now once more viewed as the final arbiter and suzerain of all the Free Peoples east of the [mistymountains|E], their rock and guarantor."
 elven.0805.a: "Once more these lands shall be secure!"

 elven.0817.t: "The Eastern Lands"
 elven.0817.desc: "The apex of the Patrimony of the High King of the [noldor|E] reached beyond the confines of the [mistymountains|E] which hem in the lands of [eriador|E], far beyond indeed, for his protection covered the [men|E] and [elves|E] of the [anduinvale|E], up until the branches of the [greenwoodshort|E] shadowed the lands. Gil-galad's dominance of these lands was the first to be lost to him, but its restoration harkens back to his lordship over the lands, when Eldar truly dominated the lands."
 elven.0817.a: "Once again none may challenge us."

 # Kinn-lai Ardinak events
 elven.0806.t: "The Shores of Ardinâk"
 elven.0806.desc: "[ardinak|E]. Many have dreamt of settling this accursed island, and many have been claimed by it. Here, at last, I am greeted by grim reminders of those past failures. Our ship docks at a crumbling stone jetty, no doubt built by the [numenoreans|E], long gone. In the distance rises what remains of their once-citadel, Shân-ta-Rhôn, now overgrown and ruined. Surrounding the fortress, on all sides, deep jungle, as dense as any I have ever seen.\n\nSomewhere here lies the Tomb of the Taurâklaksa, the place where King Tainalânn did battle with the servant of [morgothcharacter|E] in ages past. If the curse is to be ended, it will happen there, at the place of its genesis. Already, I feel a shadow upon my heart. The curse has reached me, in some small way, even now. I must make haste to my destination, but whither to?"
 elven.0806.a: "There are caves in the jungle, from which the tomb may be accessed."
 elven.0806.b: "There are catacombs beneath the Shân-ta-Rhôn we may enter."

 elven.0807.t: "The Poisoned Green"
 elven.0807.desc: "A proud [avari|E], I am well at home in the jungle. In my homeland, there exists no bird nor beast that may trouble the passage of my retinue; all are known to me, as are the flowers and trees, and every stone upon the ground.\n\nThis place is different.\n\nSomething is deeply wrong with the life here, the water is poisoned and it seeps into the roots. Nothing grows in the right direction. What few animals remain watch us with evil intent, and impede us at every opportunity. If we continue at this pace, we will be consumed by the crushing green."
 elven.0807.a: "The land is sick, it requires healing."
 elven.0807.b: "None may hinder our advance."
 elven.0807.c: "This place is an abomination. Burn a path through."

 elven.0808.t: "Failing Spirits"
 elven.0808.desc: "As my retinue pushes forward, the jungle grows darker, the shadows longer. My heart grows heavy, and I find myself longing for the cool breeze of the shore, and the gentle dancing of sunlight upon waves. There is no sun here, only the yawning mouth of a cavern, darker than pitch, waiting to swallow us whole. I know that the Tomb lies inside, and the end of our journey. As I strike a torch and prepare to enter, I see my retinue falter.\n\nThey plead with me to reconsider. 'Only death awaits,' they beg, 'or worse'. Though each pledged themselves to this mission, their spirits now waver, and they refuse to go further. They ask your leave to return to the shore."
 elven.0808.a: "Friends, this is but the brief passing of night. And soon, the dawn!"
 elven.0808.b: "They will fulfill their oaths, even if they should die in doing so."
 elven.0808.c: "They have my leave to go."
 
 elven.0809.t: "The Gates of Shân-ta-Rhôn"
 elven.0809.desc: "I come with my retinue before the gates of Shân-ta-Rhôn. Even now, millenia since its fall, it is an impressive sight. Bastions upon bastions, towers and domes, a testament to the might of [numenor|E] at its height. Walls of black marble tower above us and block entry into the city. Though no [numenoreans|E] remain to face to us, it appears that new watchers guard this post. The great steel gates are sealed, covered in thick webs. From above, I recognize the skittering of giant spiders.\n\nThough one of our company might scale the walls and sneak past the sentinels, the spawn of Enânagosnî are clever, and would surely catch us if we attempted the climb together."
 elven.0809.a: "I will sneak inside and open the gates from within."
 elven.0809.b: "A frontal assault. Together, they cannot withstand us."
 elven.0809.c: "Keep watch here, I will enter alone."

 elven.0810.t: "The Restless Dead"
 elven.0810.desc: "I make my way through the streets of Shân-ta-Rhôn. Though overgrown, and ravaged by time, I cannot help but imagine them as they were in those final days. What must they have been like, as pestilence gripped the island? What of those countless dead, taken by the plague? It is not long before I find the answer to my query. Steps lead down beneath the streets, to miles of winding catacombs. Here were placed the victims of the curse, until there were none left to collect the dead.\n\nEntering, I feel shadow grip my heart ever more tightly. There is great pain here, confusion, and hatred. I am surrounded by the dead, and the dead keep this place. They will not allow me to pass, unless I am one of them.\n\nThey rise, and draw cold steel."
 elven.0810.a: "Come then, to battle."
 elven.0810.b: "Halt, spirits! I am not your enemy."

 elven.0812.t: "Tomb of the Taurâklaksa"
 elven.0812.desc: "At last, I enter the Tomb. The stonework is older than that of [numenor|E], a crude and evil hovel wrought by the Taurâklaksa themself. I imagine what it must have been like for Tainalânn to journey here, to have fought the Taurâklaksa in its full might. Though he destroyed its physical form, the horror endured in spirit, its poison spreading throughout [ardinak|E]. The curse claimed Tainalânn and many years later it claimed Shân-ta-Rhôn. Now, the curse creeps its tendrils into my heart.\n\nIf I am to end the curse once and for all, I must defeat the Taurâklaksa both in spirit and in might. I calm my mind as best as I can, and settle into meditation.\n\nI breath in, I close my eyes, I breath out. I am [Glossary('fëa','fea_gloss')] and I am [Glossary('hröa','hroa_gloss')]. I move slowly, channeling my energy through each methodical stance."

I feel fear welling up within me, my hands trembling, as a mocking voice greets me.\n\n'A lesser elf than Tainalânn are you,' it says, 'and yet greater than all those pitiful few that shall come after you.'\n\nVisions of destruction fill my sight. I see the failing of my realm, and the victory of the shadow. I see a plague that spreads across the land, killing by the thousands. This is all my fault!"

For a moment, we each hesitate, and then the dance begins.\n\nI move like water, weaving slow at first, and then fast, with the force of crushing rapids. In turn, the Curse of [ardinak|E] unleashes its full fury, grasping at the edges of my mind, tearing at any thread that it can. Fear, despair, heartbreak, and regret, I steel my mind against the torrent of emotion the shadow unleashes.\n\nTo the depths we battle, and back out to the surface again. We are both slowing, our spirits exhausted. The end is near."
 elven.0814.a: "One final blow..."

 elven.0815.t: "The Curse, Defeated"
 elven.0815.desc: "There is a shriek like plunging knives, the sound of a thousand voices crying out in agony and despair, and for a moment I am not sure from which of us it came. The sound lingers for a moment, and then fades.\n\nAnd then I hear the sound of birds.\n\nA single shaft of sunlight pierces nervously from the canopy above, and I feel a weight lift from my heart. I have done it. The curse is lifted. I limp back to my ship, this grim task finally behind me. It will take years to rebuild this place properly, but that work can now begin."
 elven.0815.a: "I need to lie down."

 elven.0816.desc: "You launch yourself at the Taurâklaksa, it feints, feints again, and then strikes. There is a shriek like plunging knives, the sound of a thousand voices crying out in agony and despair. It is not until I feel the cold ground against my face that I realize the sound came from my own lungs.\n\nI feel my mind breaking as the curse takes its full hold of me. It takes all of my might to dodge its next attack, and wrench myself free from the trance. Crawling, wailing, I flee from the Tomb, and as I go, I hear the Taurâklaksa laugh.\n\n'Come again, when you are ready, oh heir of Tainalânn! I await you!'"

At their helm stands [eonwecharacter|E], herald of [manwecharactershort|E], and he speaks with the voice of the Elder King, vice-regent of [eaworld|E]. In his hands is both banner and blade, lightning made manifest to bring judgement upon the mortal lands.\n\nHis voice is carried on the winds of his master, strong and clear. All but the most depraved flinch at its thundering, as it passes through the plains and in the deeps of mountain passes. The darkness is set to flight by its passing. And his voice is answered by his host, trumpets of silver and gold proclaiming their coming.\n\nIt is a summons. A summon once more to war, to rally again to the banner-bearer of Manwë and the forces of the [undyinglands|E]. A summon to labor together, until the [Concept('sauroncharacter','darkness')|E] is once more banished from these lands and they be made free. A summons to all people fair and free."
