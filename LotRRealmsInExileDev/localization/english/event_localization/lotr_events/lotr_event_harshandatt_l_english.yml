 harshandatt.0001.t: "Harshandatt Restored!"
 harshandatt.0001.desc: "For centuries, ancient Harshandatt has lain in ruins, divided between petty warring Núara and Mejhanian-dominated states. No longer! This day, I am to assume the throne of a restored Harshandatt, undisputable Nhazadh of all the lands of the Núar, and Mejhanir with the blessing of supreme Anhûr.\n\nThe Henúhdt and Vohnët of all the gods gather around me, cleaning the dirt from my skin then dousing me with anointing oils and perfumes while chanting prayers of protection. Reverently, they dress me in the most esquisite finery and offer me the ceremonial beer, making sure to never look me, the son of Saath in the eye. Preparations complete, they process ahaead of me into the throne hall where I shal greet my subjects for the first time as Nhazadh. Incense clouds the air as I emerge from behind billowing curtains. I take my seat, and the thousands of congregants fall to their knees in reverance. I have become a living god."
 harshandatt.0001.a: "Let them worship their Nhazadh!"
