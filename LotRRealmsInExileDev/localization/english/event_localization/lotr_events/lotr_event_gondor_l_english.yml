 numenoreanblood.1001.desc:0 "My partner, [dead_character.GetTitledFirstName], has passed away and gone the way of countless generations of [men|E] before us.\n\nIt is customary among our people to take but one spouse, as the [eldar|E] do, within the circles of this world. The law of [numenor|E] of old, which our culture still maintains, permits me to take another if I am still in the fullness of my days, desiring of children. However, such a thing is frowned upon - many view it as abandoning the sacred union of wedded man and wife.\n\nAs I already have had children, such a choice will not be looked upon generously by others. I must make a choice, now. Shall I follow tradition and never take another to be my spouse, or shall I look for another, despite the possible backlash?"

Only my brother, Boromir, has been a source of kindness in my life. Should I, then, recommit myself to the peril at hand and focus my efforts on the defence of the kingdom, or shall I finally seek solace and affection long-needed in the arms of another?"

He is strong and obviously a master with both sword and bow, felling a deer from some fifty meters without issue. I remain hidden for a time as he skins and strips the deer of its meat and hide, but somehow, I feel as though he knows I am watching.\n\nOnly after I am certain that he is done with his work do I dare approach, holding my hands up slightly to declare my peaceful intent. The man looks back at me, then squints from behind his helm... Something does not seem quite right with him up close. The armour he wears seems almost too big for him, and his eyes are even more radiant than before.\n\nWithout so much as a word, the soldier reaches up and pulls his helm from his head, revealing not the face of a rugged veteran of the Riddermark, but rather a maiden most fair. Her hair is long, spun like gold, and her skin is as pale and beautiful as the Winter snows. There is nothing that I can say that can possible explain how I feel; so pure and filled with wonderment that only my actions are surely enough. Is she, this Shieldmaiden of Rohan, the one I have sought for all these years?"
 gondor.0302.a:0 "Love, sweet and filled with bliss, at last..."

 gondor.0303.desc:0 "There is more news from the White City, my lord. After assuming his kingship, the new High King Aragorn has also decided to make a Rohirric Shieldmaiden his queen. Though most are sceptical of this choice, her apparent skill with both sword and lance is almost without equal. With these good tidings, perhaps it is time for you to finally consider a marriage of your own?"

I remain hidden for a time as he skins and strips the deer of its meat and hide, but somehow, I feel as though he knows I am watching.\n\nOnly after I am certain that he is done with his work do I dare approach, holding my hands up slightly to declare my peaceful intent.\n\nWithout so much as a word, the ranger reaches up and pulls his helm from his head, revealing a fair and noble face, dark-haired and grey-eyed, proud and stern of glance. There is nothing that I can say that can possible explain how I feel; so pure and filled with wonderment that only my actions are surely enough. Is he, this Ranger of Ithilien, the one I have sought for all these years?"

Great winged helms and long cloaks of blue, a Knight of Dol Amroth is a sight to behold, lance held high and chin even higher, dignity renewed.\n\nThis is what the rest of the world sees in the knights of Dor-en-Ernil, but only one in the Order itself knows the truth. Chivalry is dead, replaced by bribery and bloodlines and every other misfortune of men. If the Order of the Swan is to be reformed, then the reformer certainly has his work cut out for him. The Amrothian Reserves will need to be expanded; the old oaths of Edhellond upheld; the Sea-ward regiments will need to be made anew again; and the ancient Order of the Tirith Aear must be reforged. Only after these things are completed can the [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip]s of Dol Amroth reclaim their honour. A new order — that of the Silver Swan — shall rise in the old order's place."

Their ranks amongst the Order have sat empty, oaths unsaid as the rot festered within the organization. We must make anew our oaths of old.\n\nIf they could be reintegrated into the armies of the [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip], they could serve as a powerful and innovative contingent."

The Nimrodel rangers, based on traditions of the [sindarelves|E], form the largest part of their contingent, but they are accompanied by the Knights of Edhellond as well. Uniquely amongst [gondorians|E], these knights make use of bow and arrow while riding horseback, allowing them to brutally harass the enemy without ever risking themselves in a charge.\n\nThe [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip]'s armies have been much ennobled by their addition."

However, as Pelargir has risen in prominence as the heart of the Royal Navy, this guard division has dwindled to a skeleton force, maintaining a few coastal lookouts at most.\n\nIf we could expand them once more; they would once again serve us well as fearsome shock-troops."

Required to swear oaths of virtue and valour, these wardens should be of unimpeacheable character. But of all the classes of the old Order, this one rotted most, with the position being given on account of blood, not valour. It will require great effort to rebuild it to its former glory. \n\nWe shall begin by dismissing those of the order known to be corrupt, and then begin searching for those people worthy of this great honour."

 ### RETURN OF THE KING EVENTS ###
 gondor.0500.t:0 "The Throne of the Southern Kingdom"
 gondor.0500.desc:0 "For many generations, the Throne of Gondor has sat absent, since King Eärnur disappeared into Minas Ithil in 2050 T.A. While the Stewards have served nobly in their absence, the lack of a King has been a gaping wound in the Kingdom that no amount of faithful service might heal. The people lose faith, and the Shadow in the East grows bold, testing the borders of Gondor.\n\nMany years ago, I served the noble steward Ecthelion under the name Thorongil. I led an assault on the havens of Umbar, burning the Corsair fleets. But now Gondor is assaulted on all sides, not only from sea, and its valour buckles under the strain.\n\nWhile once the Southern Kingdom rejected the claim of Arvedui, much now has changed since then. Perhaps the time has come for the Heirs of Isildur to unveil ourselves once more, and stake our claim to rule and guide Gondor again."

Though his hair has grown longer, and a slight greying of his black hair, Thorongil, who served your father, stands before you.\n\nHe announces he comes to claim his birthright, before presenting his claim. He names himself Aragorn II, son of Arathorn, chieftain of the [dunedainarnor|E] the heir of [Isildur|E] son of [Elendil|E]. To prove his claim, he presents the shards of Narsil, the White Flame, which cut the ring from [sauroncharacter|E]'s finger. He also shows the Ring of Barahir which was borne out of [numenor|E], and the testimony of the [elves|E] of [rivendell|E] and his northern kin, who accompany him. There can be little doubt that he says the truth.\n\nOnce the Council of [gondor|E] had rejected such a claim of the [northernkingdom|E], but the line of Anárion is spent and no more.

Those who remember Thorongil of the North whisper the King and the great hero are one and the same. \n\nAt long last, the seat of the Kings is no longer empty, and [gondor|E] begins to rose itself from its long, lethargic rest. A new age is dawning, it is heard on the wind and felt in the earth. \n\nThe days of the King have come at last, and may they be blessed."

Guards whisper of the foolishness of rejecting the King at this hour, when Gondor is pressed on all sides, and in the name of a line — that of Anárion — which has no more heirs. Many are openly decrying it as a blatant power grab by the Stewards, grown arrogant in their long mastery of the realm.\n\nThe Guilds are complaining of disruptions in trade, rumours are even spreading of a meeting to be held in Dol Amroth gathering all the great Lords of Gondor."

To your frustration, the other lords argue for a more measured approach to first present an ultimatum to the ruling Steward.\n\nIt takes but a short while afterwards for the resolution to be drafted, in four languages it is written out; [sindarin|E], [quenya|E], the common tongue, and High Adûnaic. The demands are short and to the point, demanding the restoration of the Kingship to the line of Elendil, with Aragorn II of Arthedain and Arnor taking the throne as Aragorn I of Gondor.

None in Minas Tirith misunderstand the implications. If the King is not crowned and his claim accepted, his supporters shall take up arms in his name, even without his command.\n\nYet you are not without your own supporters. The provinces of Anorien, Ithilien, and Lossarnach have not joined in the petition, and are more concerned with the encroaching threat to the East than an internal dispute of leadership.

Though not a man of superb calibre like the late Aragorn, the new King is proving to be competent in his role and is doing all he can to help the kingdom heal its self-inflicted wounds.\n\nAt long last, the seat of the Kings is no longer empty, and Gondor begins to rouse itself from its long, lethargic rest.

After much debate, the Lords of Gondor agree that their King shall be elected from among his fellows and is charged to maintain their traditions and rites in the name of the Faithful.\n\nThe Prince of Dol Amroth has been elected unanimously by his fellows, on account of his nobility, righteous, and the ancient kinship of the house of Imrazôr to the lords of Andúnië, and thus to Elros Tar-Minyatur.

Now the first King of Húrin’s Line, the former Steward must legitimize his rule over the Faithful Dúnedain and has made his intention clear to ascend the fane of Mindolluin as proof of his legitimacy.

 ### GONDOR DECISION EVENTS ###
 
 gondor.1000.t:0 "The Reclamation of Harondor"
 gondor.1000.desc:0 "For many years, Harondor has slowly slipped away from the control of Gondor, the Haradrim gaining evermore power therein and pushing the Dúnedain from their lands. Now at last the tide has been reversed, and the province fully reclaimed. \n\nLet it be said Harondor is a contested land no longer — Gondor has reclaimed her own!"
 gondor.1000.a:0 "A great day for all Dúnedain."
 
 gondor.1001.t:0 "Gondor proclaims the Province of Harondor"
 gondor.1001.desc:0 "In a grand proclamation, the royal authorities in [gondor|E] have proclaimed that the Province of Harondor has been fully reclaimed at long last. They promise that they shall exert every effort to restore the province's eroded infrastructure and to rebuild the economy of the war-torn province. Many have begun to question if this is the herald of a larger Gondorian reconquest of other lost territories. \n\nWhatever else, nobody can now deny that Gondor has a firm grip over Harondor now."
 gondor.1001.a:0 "Congratulations are in order for Minas Tirith."
 gondor.1001.b:0 "Damn them! They have no right to that land, colonisers and usurpers!"
 
 gondor.1002.t:0 "The Province of Andrast"
 gondor.1002.desc:0 "While theoretically always a part of [gondor|E], in practice Andrast has been at best a loose network of Dúnedain tributaries outside the lands overseen by Tharagrondost, and at worst a fully independent region. The rugged mountains and hilly terrain make it a difficult land to establish reliable communication and logistic networks, but after much work and toil, the region at least seems to be coming together under a new provincial administration. \n\nStanding in Tharagrondost, once the lone citadel of the Dúnedain in a hostile land, you can already see how the land is being bound together with greater Gondor, new trade goods beginning to flow, merchants visiting from near and far. Furs, honeys and trees from Andrast are flowing eastward, exchanged for the wines, wheat, and fine clothing of the Gondorian heartland. Though there is still much work to be done, you can rest secure in your legacy, as you have finally integrated the most troublesome of Gondor's provinces." 
 gondor.1002.a:0 "Dúnedain or Andrastrim, my subjects shall prosper, hand in hand."
 
 gondor.1003.t:0 "The Great Haven of Umbar"
 gondor.1003.desc:0 "Since the foundation of the [realms_in_exile|E], [umbar|E] — itself a third such realm — has waxed between an annoyance and a knife poised at the heart of [gondor|E]. During the reign of Eärnil I, the havens were at last brought under Gondorian control, and it remained part of the Winged Crown for 500 years. It became a Gondorian pretender-realm when the sons of Castamir the Usurper fled there, and since then it has been a sanctuary of pirates and foes of Gondor. Umbardacil managed to subdue it for some years, but his work still came to naught and the Corsairs have remained a unchecked scourge.\n\nNow though, with a decisive campaign which saw the royal fleet sailing into the great port, Umbar has fallen once more to Gondorian might. Now, the time has come to neuter the threat for good — with assimilation and integration. Let Umbar be a prosperous province of Gondor, this great haven of the Númenóreans."

After being ushered in, he cuts immediately to the point – Rohan is hard pressed by its foes, and calls upon Gondor to aid her, as both sides swore in the days of Eorl and Cirion. Many times has the oath been called upon by both sides, and the few times it has not been fulfilled was due to both kingdoms simultaneously facing attacks.\n\nWhat does the White Tower bid this messenger of the Horse-lords? Does Gondor stand with her Northern ally?"

Rohan had come at last.” \n\nIn response to our call, the Rohirrim have answered in full. Even now, their mighty horns can be heard blasting in the hills and the earth trembles at the approach of their great cavalry. Eorl’s heirs have not forgotten Gondor, nor their oath, and ride now to our aid in the fullness of their might.\n\nUnited in our great struggle, the valour of Gondor and Rohan shall withstand all those who seek to destroy them."

While they cannot spare the fullness of their army to assist us, the Rohirrim have sent a strong army, well equipped, and led by one of their foremost lords.\n\nAlready discussions have begun on how best to utilize the Rohirrim’s powerful cavalry in the battles to come, and how best to supply them now that they are here in Gondor. But such problems are trifling in the face of the arrival of dear friends and old allies to aid us.\n\nWith their cavalry guarding our flank and smashing into the enemies’ rear, our situation seems no longer quite so dire."

 gondor.2003.t:0 "Auxiliaries of Rohan"
 gondor.2003.desc:0 "The Rohirrim have sent auxiliaries to aid us in our battle. Rugged and effective, these troops are few but make for it in their zeal and fighting spirit. They have already begun to be employed as very effective scouting parties and have managed to launch some effective ambushes in coordination with our own forward captains.\n\nWhile we would have liked more, the Rohirrim envoys say that more men simply cannot be spared at this time. We shall make do with the men we have, and the Rohirrim sending even this small amount is a reminder that we are not alone in our fight, nor without friends in the wider world."
 gondor.2003.a:0 "Some men are better than none."

 gondor.2004.t:0 "Where now the Horse and the Rider?"
 gondor.2004.desc:0 "We sent the rider bearing the Red Arrow weeks ago, but he has only now returned, sadly disappointed. It is apparent on his face that no aid shall come from the Horse-lords.\n\nIn explanation, he says that the Horse-lords have claimed to be too hard-pressed in their own affairs to offer any aid to Gondor at the moment – but that they will not forget Gondor, and once they are able shall send forces to aid us in our wars. Of course, by such a time, our own war might well have finished."

We shall snuff out the Dark Lord, root and stem, and make of his land such a desolation that never again shall he be able to raise it anew. \n\nI see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me! A day may come when the courage of Men fails! When we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship. But it is not this day! An hour of wolves and shattered shields, as the Age of Men comes crashing down! But it is not this day. By all that you hold dear, on this good earth..."

His mighty tower has crumbled without his will to support it, and his armies have fled in terror before the fury of the West. It is a deed thought impossible through force of arms, but the Dúnedain have done what their Númenórean forefathers could not, and at last unmade the works of Sauron, root and stem. \n\nA new age is dawning upon Middle-Earth, one of the triumphant West and the Tree and the Sceptre reunited once more.

 ### Fate of Isildur ###

 gondor.2201.desc:0 "Upon opening the great steel case, only two items are held within. Firstly, a chain with a small golden box attached, designed to be worn around the neck. The box has a fine velvet setting within, designed to hold a ring — and it is then that the realization dawns upon the expedition, for this must assuredly be the necklace with which Isildur held the Ruling Ring, after he cut it from the hand of Sauron himself.\n\nNext, however, is the greater prize. A golden cylinder, without marking or ornamentation, rests upon a fine silver pillow. Once it is opened, an audible gasp rises. Attached to a chain of mithril and glowing with an ancient light, a great jewel inlaid in gold and mithril is contained within. This is the Elendilmir, the Star of Elendil, Star of the North Kingdom, borne out of Númenor ere it fell and an heirloom of the northern kingdom. It was lost with Isildur, and since then the Kings of Arnor wore the Lesser Elendilmir, a replica made in its image by the Elves of Imladris. \n\nWith these artifacts, the fate of Isildur is now made clear. It appears his corpse was uncovered by Saruman in his many years of searching for the One, and he stripped it of all its treasures. He then burned the body, in order to remove all traces of Isildur's whereabouts, to slow all who were attempting to uncover the One Ring.\n\nSo now the tale of Isildur can be written in full, both his valour and his failings. Though he fell and his last great choice came to ruin, we must not allow that to diminish his many noble acts, for there is more to a story than its ending."

After Saruman established himself as Isengard's keeper, the Dúnedain lost swiftly all insight into the happenings of the great tower. Now, with Saruman's treachery revealed and the tower reclaimed, an accounting is in order of what he may have hidden within.\n\nThe first major discovery is an immense store of food of incomparable quality, befitting a king's table — salted pork, fine wines, fowl of every sort of game, potatoes of finest stock, and many other fine delicacies. Most surprising, however, is the discovering of several barrels filled absolutely to the brim with Longbottom Leaf! This leaf is the highest quality in the known world, grown in the Southfarthing of the Shire. It is costly to import from out of the Shire, as Bree is usually the only place such deals can be made. It is well known the White Wizard had scornfully referred to Gandalf the Gray's habit of smoking pipeweed, but it seems behind closed doors he had indulged himself!\n\nAfter moving on, the search party continues its ascent of the tower. In Saruman's study amongst many tomes of lore and trinkets of unknown device, a hidden door was discovered disguised behind a tapestry. Within is a great steel case, with a heavy lock matching a key discovered with the Key of Orthanc. We could open in, but the pipeweed is calling..."

 ### Restoration of Numenor-In-Exile

 gondor.3500.t:0 "[GetTitleByKey('e_numenor_in_exile').GetNameNoTierNoTooltip]"
 gondor.3500.desc:0 "An [age|E] ago, the island of [numenor|E], greatest of all the Kingdoms of [men|E] in the whole of [ardaconcept|E], was consumed by the waves, and the world was broken and remade. Deprived of their master, the colonies of the [numenorean_empire|E] fell apart, splintering into the [realms_in_exile|E] scattered across [middleearth|E]. [gondor|E] and [arnor|E] arose in the north, [bellakar|E] and [thanihazad|E] in the uttermost south. Since then there have been none to rival the splendor of [numenor|E]. \n\n[arnor|E], the kingdom of [elendil|E], was utterly destroyed by [angmar|E], left as naught but scattered tribes in the wilderness. Gondor declined, its territories lost, and its lands ravaged at the hands of the Darkness from the east. Bellakar and Thâni-Hazâd were all but forgotten, and so was the wretchedness of the Kingdoms of Men upon Middle-Earth. \n\nYet no more! No more shall the heirs of the once-mighty island stay divided into splintered kingdoms, but a shadow of the might and beauty of the Kingdom of [numenor|E]. \n\nAll the former lands and colonies of [numenor|E] have been reunited, for though the Isle was sundered an Age ago, there rises a new Kingdom, an image of the splendor and magnificence of the realm of the [dunedain|E] of old; and it is known across all of Middle-Earth as [GetTitleByKey('e_numenor_in_exile').GetNameNoTier]!"

 gondor.3600.desc:0 "When Elendil established Arnor, he claimed for his kingdom all of Eriador from the Gwathló to the Lhûn. Yet in the farthest north the King held only nominal sway, and after the War of the Last Alliance his successors had neither the strength nor the inclination to project their power into those cold regions.\n\nIt was in these neglected lands that the Witch King established the fell kingdom of Angmar, which brought about the downfall of the North Kingdom. Yet now Arnor is resurgent, and at last we have firmly established our control over the northlands. Never again shall we be threatened by foes from the icy wastes."

And we will instead turn our efforts to rebuilding and relearning the works of our ancestors.\n\nOur warriors' heroic sacrifices and our allies' staunch resolve have paved the way for a prosperous and peaceful future!"

This division has created strife between the peoples of both lands, ensuring that authentic unity cannot come from decree alone but instead from bridging the differences among the land.\n\nWe shall strive towards a future where all who call these lands home acknowledge the kingdoms as one!"

The people of both [gondor|E] and [arnor|E] identify with the restored kingdom. And the reconstruction efforts have mostly concluded, with all our cities reclaimed and repopulated.\n\nFrom [GetTitleByKey('c_minas_ithil').GetNameNoTier] to [GetTitleByKey('c_annuminas').GetNameNoTier], the people recognize all as one realm.
