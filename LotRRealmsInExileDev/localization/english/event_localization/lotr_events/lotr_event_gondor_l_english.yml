 numenoreanblood.1001.desc:0 "My partner, [dead_character.GetTitledFirstName], has passed away and gone the way of countless generations of [men|E] before us.\n\nIt is customary among our people to take but one spouse, as the [eldar|E] do, within the circles of this world. The law of [numenor|E] of old, which our culture still maintains, permits me to take another if I am still in the fullness of my days, desiring of children. However, such a thing is frowned upon - many view it as abandoning the sacred union of wedded man and wife.\n\nAs I already have had children, such a choice will not be looked upon generously by others. I must make a choice, now. Shall I follow tradition and never take another to be my spouse, or shall I look for another, despite the possible backlash?"

Now, the armies of Mordor march upon [GetTitleByKey('b_east_osgiliath').GetNameNoTier], preparing to seize the vital bridges with which to cross the Anduin and strike the heart of the [southernkingdom|E]. \n\nYou cannot yield the city unfought — the enemy must bleed for his prize.

 gondor.0301.desc:0 "Long have I been forced to endure the darkness of my father. He berates me and ignores my efforts no matter the magnitude of their success. Only my brother, Boromir, has been a source of kindness in my life. Should I, then, recommit myself to the peril at hand and focus my efforts on the defence of the kingdom, or shall I finally seek solace and affection long-needed in the arms of another?"

 gondor.0302.desc:0 "Whilst on a scouting mission along the western bank of the Anduin, I chance upon a lone Rohirric soldier riding through the fields. He is strong and obviously a master with both sword and bow, felling a deer from some fifty meters without issue. I remain hidden for a time as he skins and strips the deer of its meat and hide, but somehow, I feel as though he knows I am watching.\n\nOnly after I am certain that he is done with his work do I dare approach, holding my hands up slightly to declare my peaceful intent. The man looks back at me, then squints from behind his helm... Something does not seem quite right with him up close. The armour he wears seems almost too big for him, and his eyes are even more radiant than before.\n\nWithout so much as a word, the soldier reaches up and pulls his helm from his head, revealing not the face of a rugged veteran of the Riddermark, but rather a maiden most fair. Her hair is long, spun like gold, and her skin is as pale and beautiful as the Winter snows. There is nothing that I can say that can possible explain how I feel; so pure and filled with wonderment that only my actions are surely enough. Is she, this Shieldmaiden of Rohan, the one I have sought for all these years?"
 gondor.0302.a:0 "Love, sweet and filled with bliss, at last..."
 gondor.0302.b:0 "She is but a common Rohirric woman. Marry her I cannot."

 gondor.0303.desc:0 "There is more news from the White City, my lord. After assuming his kingship, the new High King Aragorn has also decided to make a Rohirric Shieldmaiden his queen. Though most are sceptical of this choice, her apparent skill with both sword and lance is almost without equal. With these good tidings, perhaps it is time for you to finally consider a marriage of your own?"

I remain hidden for a time as he skins and strips the deer of its meat and hide, but somehow, I feel as though he knows I am watching.\n\nOnly after I am certain that he is done with his work do I dare approach, holding my hands up slightly to declare my peaceful intent.\n\nWithout so much as a word, the ranger reaches up and pulls his helm from his head, revealing a fair and noble face, dark-haired and grey-eyed, proud and stern of glance. There is nothing that I can say that can possible explain how I feel; so pure and filled with wonderment that only my actions are surely enough. Is he, this Ranger of Ithilien, the one I have sought for all these years?"
 gondor.0304.a:0 "Love, sweet and filled with bliss, at last..."

Great winged helms and long cloaks of blue, a Knight of Dol Amroth is a sight to behold, lance held high and chin even higher, dignity renewed.\n\nThis is what the rest of the world sees in the knights of Dor-en-Ernil, but only one in the Order itself knows the truth. Chivalry is dead, replaced by bribery and bloodlines and every other misfortune of men. If the Order of the Swan is to be reformed, then the reformer certainly has his work cut out for him. The Amrothian Reserves will need to be expanded; the old oaths of Edhellond upheld; the Sea-ward regiments will need to be made anew again; and the ancient Order of the Tirith Aear must be reforged. Only after these things are completed can the [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip]s of Dol Amroth reclaim their honour. A new order — that of the Silver Swan — shall rise in the old order's place."

However, despite this, their ranks have been sadly depleted, the role viewed as lacking in honour and splendour and thus neglected.\n\nLet us work on restoring this backbone of our forces to their proper fighting strength."

They have put their social ranks aside to fight side by side in the Amrothian soldiery, training long and enduring great discomforts.\n\nThese soldiers form the backbone of our élite forces and let none gainsay their honour or their courage!

They strive to emulate Elven tactics in warfare, in contrast with the rest of [gondor|E], who maintain a firm martial tradition inherited from the days of [numenor|E]. Their ranks amongst the Order have sat empty, oaths unsaid as the rot festered within the organization. We must make anew our oaths of old.\n\nIf they could be reintegrated into the armies of the [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip], they could serve as a powerful and innovative contingent."

The Nimrodel rangers, based on traditions of the [sindarelves|E], form the largest part of their contingent, but they are accompanied by the Knights of Edhellond as well. Uniquely amongst [gondorians|E], these knights make use of bow and arrow while riding horseback, allowing them to brutally harass the enemy without ever risking themselves in a charge.\n\nThe [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip]'s armies have been much ennobled by their addition."

However, as Pelargir has risen in prominence as the heart of the Royal Navy, this guard division has dwindled to a skeleton force, maintaining a few coastal lookouts at most.\n\nIf we could expand them once more; they would once again serve us well as fearsome shock-troops."

The name has also become that of the élite guard units which protect the tower, the Oathkeepers of Tirith-Aear, the best of the Sea-ward troops. Required to swear oaths of virtue and valour, these wardens should be of unimpeacheable character. But of all the classes of the old Order, this one rotted most, with the position being given on account of blood, not valour. It will require great effort to rebuild it to its former glory. \n\nWe shall begin by dismissing those of the order known to be corrupt, and then begin searching for those people worthy of this great honour."

Of unmatched moral fibre and great skill in arms, only a select few are ever counted amongst this most hallowed order. To be offered such a chance is accounted an honour beyond price in the lands of Dol Amroth, and few refuse it, for it is both a great honour and a crushing duty. \n\nWith these handpicked warriors, paragons of valour and skill, the [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] has nothing to fear, for [ROOT.Char.GetSheHe] is guarded by the most capable men in all of Dor-en-Ernil."

 ### RETURN OF THE KING EVENTS ###
 gondor.0500.t:0 "The Throne of the Southern Kingdom"
 gondor.0500.desc:0 "For many generations, the Throne of Gondor has sat absent, since King Eärnur disappeared into Minas Ithil in 2050 T.A. While the Stewards have served nobly in their absence, the lack of a King has been a gaping wound in the Kingdom that no amount of faithful service might heal. The people lose faith, and the Shadow in the East grows bold, testing the borders of Gondor.\n\nMany years ago, I served the noble steward Ecthelion under the name Thorongil. I led an assault on the havens of Umbar, burning the Corsair fleets. But now Gondor is assaulted on all sides, not only from sea, and its valour buckles under the strain.\n\nWhile once the Southern Kingdom rejected the claim of Arvedui, much now has changed since then. Perhaps the time has come for the Heirs of Isildur to unveil ourselves once more, and stake our claim to rule and guide Gondor again."
 gondor.0500.a:0 "The time has come to unveil ourselves."

Though his hair has grown longer, and a slight greying of his black hair, Thorongil, who served your father, stands before you.\n\nHe announces he comes to claim his birthright, before presenting his claim. He names himself Aragorn II, son of Arathorn, chieftain of the [dunedainarnor|E] the heir of [Isildur|E] son of [Elendil|E]. To prove his claim, he presents the shards of Narsil, the White Flame, which cut the ring from [sauroncharacter|E]'s finger. He also shows the Ring of Barahir which was borne out of [numenor|E], and the testimony of the [elves|E] of [rivendell|E] and his northern kin, who accompany him. There can be little doubt that he says the truth.\n\nOnce the Council of [gondor|E] had rejected such a claim of the [northernkingdom|E], but the line of Anárion is spent and no more. What says the Ruling Steward of Gondor?"

Minstrels furiously compose new pieces, loremasters speak of the King's ancient lineage and his proud bearing, and the people have doubled their effort to make the city as beautiful as it ever was. Those who remember Thorongil of the North whisper the King and the great hero are one and the same. \n\nAt long last, the seat of the Kings is no longer empty, and [gondor|E] begins to rose itself from its long, lethargic rest. A new age is dawning, it is heard on the wind and felt in the earth. \n\nThe days of the King have come at last, and may they be blessed."

 gondor.0550.desc:0 "Shocking news has come regarding matters in Minas Tirith. The ruling Steward has rejected the claim of Aragorn II of the Dúnedain of Arnor to the Gondorian Throne, after seeing the evidence of his pedigree and lineage. Such a claim was rejected once before — but that was when there was still an heir of Anárion to claim the throne. If not a scion of Isildur, who then could be deemed worthy?\n\nHowever, true rage only follows after the revelation that Aragorn and the legendary Thorongil are one and the same. Thorongil, the great Captain who laid low Umbar, who counselled Ecthelion II so prudently. If he was worthy of Kingship then, is he not still worthy now?\n\nThe audacity of the Steward's treasonous act against Gondor and her people has left the people of Dol Amroth scathing in anger. Such treason requires action, and your heralds are already scattering across the realm calling all lords loyal to Gondor to meet in Dol Amroth to discuss the matter."

Thorongil, the great Captain who laid low Umbar, who counselled Ecthelion II so prudently.\n\nUnease has now been kindled into scathing anger at the Steward's duplicity, with many calling it treason to Gondor and her people. A great meet has been called in Dol Amroth to discuss the issue, and many great lords of Gondor have already signalled their intent to attend."
 gondor.0551.a:0 "I must attend this meeting... I can feel it!"
 gondor.0551.b:0 "I have more pressing matters to worry about."

 gondor.0552.t:0 "Murmurings in Minas Tirith"
 gondor.0552.desc:0 "While Aragorn accepted the refusal of the Stewards with grim composure and sorrowful acceptance, a disquiet has spread throughout the city. Guards whisper of the foolishness of rejecting the King at this hour, when Gondor is pressed on all sides, and in the name of a line — that of Anárion — which has no more heirs. Many are openly decrying it as a blatant power grab by the Stewards, grown arrogant in their long mastery of the realm.\n\nThe Guilds are complaining of disruptions in trade, rumours are even spreading of a meeting to be held in Dol Amroth gathering all the great Lords of Gondor."
 gondor.0552.a:0 "Let them talk!"
 
 gondor.0553.t:0 "The Accord of Dol Amroth"
 gondor.0553.desc:0 "At last, the great lords of Gondor have gathered to discuss the issue of the rejected claim of Aragorn by the Stewards. The nobility of the eastern provinces has largely snubbed the meeting, occupied by their own concerns of the encroaching threat of Mordor.\n\nAs host and Prince of Dol Amroth, you take the lead, arguing in a fiery speech for the lords to immediately march to Minas Tirith and crown the rightful King — by force, if necessary. To your frustration, the other lords argue for a more measured approach to first present an ultimatum to the ruling Steward.\n\nIt takes but a short while afterwards for the resolution to be drafted, in four languages it is written out; [sindarin|E], [quenya|E], the common tongue, and High Adûnaic. The demands are short and to the point, demanding the restoration of the Kingship to the line of Elendil, with Aragorn II of Arthedain and Arnor taking the throne as Aragorn I of Gondor. If not, it warns, the lords shall take up arms to restore the rightful ruler of Gondor."
 gondor.0553.a:0 "I shall be the first to sign, though I do not expect the traitor to turn."

The nobility of the eastern provinces has largely snubbed the meeting, occupied by their own concerns of the encroaching threat of Mordor.\n\nThe Prince of Dol Amroth takes the lead, visibly incensed at the actions of the Stewards, arguing in a fiery speech for them to immediately march to Minas Tirith and crown the rightful King — by force, if necessary. The other lords temper his fire somewhat, and eventually talk him down to first presenting an ultimatum to the ruling steward. If that fails, then they shall use force of arms.\n\nIt takes but a short while afterwards for the resolution to be drafted, in four languages it is written out; [sindarin|E], [quenya|E], the common tongue, and High Adûnaic.

 gondor.0555.t:0 "The Royalist Ultimatum"
 gondor.0555.desc:0 "Late in the evening a rider arrives at Minas Tirith, and presents a petition to you, outlining the demands of the Lords of Gondor.\n\nThey demand a restoration of the King, effective immediately, or they shall be forced to consider actions to curb, as they say 'the late errors of judgement by the stewards'. None in Minas Tirith misunderstand the implications. If the King is not crowned and his claim accepted, his supporters shall take up arms in his name, even without his command.\n\nYet you are not without your own supporters. The provinces of Anorien, Ithilien, and Lossarnach have not joined in the petition, and are more concerned with the encroaching threat to the East than an internal dispute of leadership. But these provinces are far weaker in comparison to the royalists, and the Dark Lord would savour a chance to strike a Gondor weakened by internal strife..."

 gondor.0556.desc:0 "A reply has to been issued to the Royalist League, and it is with a sigh of relief that I read it in my chamber. It announces the Steward's intention to back down from his foolish objection and to relinquish control of Gondor to Isildur's rightful heir.\n\nWith this, the fires of rebellion appear to have been quenched, though you cannot help but feel like Gondor is less united than you once thought, and at the hour when unity is needed most."

 gondor.0557.t:0 "The King Strife"
 gondor.0557.desc:0 "A reply has to been issued to the Royalist League, and it is with grim composure that you read it in your chamber. It furiously denounces all the signatories of the ultimatum as saboteurs and traitors to Gondor. It then goes even further, demanding the reigning Prince of Dol Amroth be stripped of his title and undergo exile for the masterminding of this 'rebellion against the lawful authority of the Steward'.\n\nWith this, all hopes for any peaceful resolution have faded away — the line of Imrazôr shall leave their shining city on the sea, and ride in the name of honour and that of their chosen king."

 gondor.0558.desc:0 "[gondor|E], for months rumbling after the rejection of the claims of the heir of Isildur to the Gondorian throne, has finally boiled over into outright conflict. The Royalists, led by the Prince of Dol Amroth, have taken up arms to enforce the Kingship by force. The Steward on the other hand is scrambling to assemble what allies he can in order to cling to his power.\n\nIn this war, there are no neutrals in Gondor — one side must be picked. Yet we might also seize this moment to break away from Gondor's yoke..."

Just give the word my lord, and we shall march immediately for Gondor."

Attempts at a peaceful resolution via petition have failed, with the steward branding all its signatories traitors.\n\nThe Steward's support is highest in the eastern provinces of Anorien, Ithilien, and Lossarnach, but even there it is a slim majority absolute. Most of the Western lords have thrown in with the Royalists, and this time there is no Northmen army to save the lord in Minas Tirith..."

The King is proving to be a healer, both of spirits and of bodies, and the kingdom itself seems to already be on the mend from its self-inflicted wounds.\n\nAt long last, the seat of the Kings is no longer empty, and Gondor begins to rouse itself from its long, lethargic rest. A new age is dawning, it is heard on the wind and felt in the earth. The days of the King have come at last, and may they be blessed."

 gondor.0563.t:0 "The Fate of the Stewards"
 gondor.0563.desc:0 "With the coronation complete, a decision must be made on the office of the Steward of Gondor. For many generations, the House of Húrin reigned fairly and justly over Gondor — but now they have brought strife and hurt upon it, and so a decision must be made.\n\nThe more zealous members of the royalist league are calling for the execution of the former reigning steward, as well as his heir. Others are taking a more conciliatory perspective, pushing for house-arrest, and clemency for the rest of the family. There is also, of course, banishment from the realm.\n\nFor the office itself, all appear to agree it cannot again fall into a hereditary dynasty. Once, the Steward was just one councillor among many, head of the Council of Gondor — the office grew more powerful as the line of Anárion leaned more upon them in their waning days. But properly returned to its original purpose, the position of steward could still serve the realm well."
 gondor.0563.a:0 "Only the swing of the executioner's axe can rid Gondor of their tyranny!"
 gondor.0563.b:0 "Keep the troublemaker under lock and key."

Our king, our rightful, just, glorious king is dead, though we know not how it came to be.\n\nShall Gondor again suffer the loss of her kings, the Line of Elros broken forever? Who shall intercede with the One upon the Hallow of Mindolluin in the name of the Faithful?\n\nPerhaps there are still those of the house of Isildur in the north, from whence the King had come — even if they be not of direct descent, descent is enough at this point."

Men have received a grave wound on this day, and the Faithful most of all.\n\nBut now the question must be who shall lead [gondor|E], for she must be strong and united — if the Line of Elendil be not preserved, then their works shall at least be maintained until the memory of those days are no more. After much debate, the Lords of Gondor agree that their King shall be elected from among his fellows and is charged to maintain their traditions and rites in the name of the Faithful.\n\nThe Prince of Dol Amroth has been elected unanimously by his fellows, on account of his nobility, righteous, and the ancient kinship of the house of Imrazôr to the lords of Andúnië, and thus to Elros Tar-Minyatur. He shall bear the crown of Gondor so long as he lives."

As a token of respect, he has decreed that no king henceforth shall bear the Winged Crown, for that is an heirloom of the line of Elendil, and shall remain with them in memory until the world is remade and all wrongs made right.\n\nNo great songs or mighty applause greet the new king, but he did not expect them. [gondor|E] has gained a king this day, but it lost so much more."
 gondor.0570.a:0 "A crown is not worth this grief."
 
 gondor.0571.t:0 "The King of the Dúnedain"
 gondor.0571.desc:0 "After a bloody civil war, the Stewards have been forced to relent. Yet tragedy has still struck the Royalist cause, with the would-be-king Aragorn perishing before seeing the crown placed on his head, and with no living [dunedain|E] of his lineage left to take his place, the last hope of a return to the rule of Elros's sons has been extinguished.\n\nAfter much debate, the Lords of [gondor|E] agreed that their King should henceforth be elected from among his fellows, and be charged to maintain their traditions and rites in the name of the Faithful. In a solemn display of dignity, the Prince of Dol Amroth was selected among the lords of Gondor to be crowned in a subdued ceremony in Minas Tirith.\n\nGondor's allies breathe a sigh of relief as Gondor returns to peace, while those that are set against the Dúnedain rejoice at the weakened state the internal conflict has left their adversary."

But the line of Húrin has toiled for generations as a mere servant in name, though lord in fact. Perhaps it is time to acknowledge that the time of Elendil's heirs and their reign over [gondor|E] has passed.\n\nYour house has more than earned the throne — shall we take it at last, and declare ourselves the Kings of Húrin's Line? Or shall we hold out, hoping that one day an heir of Anarion shall show itself?"

Proclaiming their claim defunct by their long-absence, the House of Húrin has deposed the Line of Anarion. They have taken the throne of Gondor for their own by right of might, and a distant kingship to the line of Anarion. Now the first King of Húrin’s Line, the former Steward must legitimize his rule over the Faithful Dúnedain and has made his intention clear to ascend the fane of Mindolluin as proof of his legitimacy. Time shall tell if this new royal house's claim shall be accepted by [erutheone|El] and the [valar|E], or if they shall be judged for daring to usurp the line of Elendil."

 ### GONDOR DECISION EVENTS ###
 
 gondor.1000.t:0 "The Reclamation of Harondor"
 gondor.1000.desc:0 "For many years, Harondor has slowly slipped away from the control of Gondor, the Haradrim gaining evermore power therein and pushing the Dúnedain from their lands. Now at last the tide has been reversed, and the province fully reclaimed. \n\nLet it be said Harondor is a contested land no longer — Gondor has reclaimed her own!"
 gondor.1000.a:0 "A great day for all Dúnedain."
 
 gondor.1001.t:0 "Gondor proclaims the Province of Harondor"
 gondor.1001.desc:0 "In a grand proclamation, the royal authorities in [gondor|E] have proclaimed that the Province of Harondor has been fully reclaimed at long last. They promise that they shall exert every effort to restore the province's eroded infrastructure and to rebuild the economy of the war-torn province. Many have begun to question if this is the herald of a larger Gondorian reconquest of other lost territories. \n\nWhatever else, nobody can now deny that Gondor has a firm grip over Harondor now."
 gondor.1001.a:0 "Congratulations are in order for Minas Tirith."
 gondor.1001.b:0 "Damn them! They have no right to that land, colonisers and usurpers!"
 
 gondor.1002.t:0 "The Province of Andrast"
 gondor.1002.desc:0 "While theoretically always a part of [gondor|E], in practice Andrast has been at best a loose network of Dúnedain tributaries outside the lands overseen by Tharagrondost, and at worst a fully independent region. The rugged mountains and hilly terrain make it a difficult land to establish reliable communication and logistic networks, but after much work and toil, the region at least seems to be coming together under a new provincial administration. \n\nStanding in Tharagrondost, once the lone citadel of the Dúnedain in a hostile land, you can already see how the land is being bound together with greater Gondor, new trade goods beginning to flow, merchants visiting from near and far. Furs, honeys and trees from Andrast are flowing eastward, exchanged for the wines, wheat, and fine clothing of the Gondorian heartland. Though there is still much work to be done, you can rest secure in your legacy, as you have finally integrated the most troublesome of Gondor's provinces." 
 gondor.1002.a:0 "Dúnedain or Andrastrim, my subjects shall prosper, hand in hand."
 
 gondor.1003.t:0 "The Great Haven of Umbar"
 gondor.1003.desc:0 "Since the foundation of the [realms_in_exile|E], [umbar|E] — itself a third such realm — has waxed between an annoyance and a knife poised at the heart of [gondor|E]. During the reign of Hyarmendacil, the havens were at last brought under Gondorian control, and it remained part of the Winged Crown for 500 years. It became a Gondorian pretender-realm when the sons of Castamir the Usurper fled there, and since then it has been a sanctuary of pirates and foes of Gondor. \n\nNow though, with a decisive campaign which saw the royal fleet sailing into the great port, Umbar has fallen once more to Gondorian might. Now, the time has come to neuter the threat for good — with assimilation and integration. Let Umbar be a prosperous province of Gondor, this great haven of the Númenóreans."
 gondor.1003.a:0 "Hyarmendacil can rest content — his legacy is secure!"

 gondor.2000.desc:0 "A rider has arrived at Minas Tirith from Edoras, seeking an emergency audience with the Lord of the White Tower. After being ushered in, he cuts immediately to the point – Rohan is hard pressed by its foes, and calls upon Gondor to aid her, as both sides swore in the days of Eorl and Cirion. Many times has the oath been called upon by both sides, and the few times it has not been fulfilled was due to both kingdoms simultaneously facing attacks.\n\nWhat does the White Tower bid this messenger of the Horse-lords? Does Gondor stand with her Northern ally?"
 gondor.2000.a:0 "Our nations are as father and son. And a father looks after his own."

Rohan had come at last.” \n\nIn response to our call, the Rohirrim have answered in full. Even now, their mighty horns can be heard blasting in the hills and the earth trembles at the approach of their great cavalry. Eorl’s heirs have not forgotten Gondor, nor their oath, and ride now to our aid in the fullness of their might.\n\nUnited in our great struggle, the valour of Gondor and Rohan shall withstand all those who seek to destroy them."
 gondor.2001.a:0 "Hope is kindled."

 gondor.2002.t:0 "The Riders of Rohan"
 gondor.2002.desc:0 "A host has arrived from Rohan to aid us in our war. While they cannot spare the fullness of their army to assist us, the Rohirrim have sent a strong army, well equipped, and led by one of their foremost lords.\n\nAlready discussions have begun on how best to utilize the Rohirrim’s powerful cavalry in the battles to come, and how best to supply them now that they are here in Gondor. But such problems are trifling in the face of the arrival of dear friends and old allies to aid us.\n\nWith their cavalry guarding our flank and smashing into the enemies’ rear, our situation seems no longer quite so dire."
 gondor.2002.a:0 "We will not forget their loyalty and friendship."

 gondor.2003.t:0 "Auxiliaries of Rohan"
 gondor.2003.desc:0 "The Rohirrim have sent auxiliaries to aid us in our battle. Rugged and effective, these troops are few but make for it in their zeal and fighting spirit. They have already begun to be employed as very effective scouting parties and have managed to launch some effective ambushes in coordination with our own forward captains.\n\nWhile we would have liked more, the Rohirrim envoys say that more men simply cannot be spared at this time. We shall make do with the men we have, and the Rohirrim sending even this small amount is a reminder that we are not alone in our fight, nor without friends in the wider world."
 gondor.2003.a:0 "Some men are better than none."

 gondor.2004.t:0 "Where now the Horse and the Rider?"
 gondor.2004.desc:0 "We sent the rider bearing the Red Arrow weeks ago, but he has only now returned, sadly disappointed. It is apparent on his face that no aid shall come from the Horse-lords.\n\nIn explanation, he says that the Horse-lords have claimed to be too hard-pressed in their own affairs to offer any aid to Gondor at the moment – but that they will not forget Gondor, and once they are able shall send forces to aid us in our wars. Of course, by such a time, our own war might well have finished."

Our sons bleed, and our children wail in fear. Well, no longer! Gondor shall no quail in fear, but march forward with our heads held high. We shall snuff out the Dark Lord, root and stem, and make of his land such a desolation that never again shall he be able to raise it anew. \n\nI see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me! A day may come when the courage of Men fails! When we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship. But it is not this day! An hour of wolves and shattered shields, as the Age of Men comes crashing down! But it is not this day. By all that you hold dear, on this good earth..."

The deaths of Eärnur, Elendil, Isildur, and the destruction of Númenor itself are at last avenged, for the Dark Lord is banished, his form upon this plane eviscerated. His mighty tower has crumbled without his will to support it, and his armies have fled in terror before the fury of the West. It is a deed thought impossible through force of arms, but the Dúnedain have done what their Númenórean forefathers could not, and at last unmade the works of Sauron, root and stem. \n\nA new age is dawning upon Middle-Earth, one of the triumphant West and the Tree and the Sceptre reunited once more. Long shall this memory endure, while the thrones of the Valar endure."

The Dark Tower, deprived of its master, swiftly collapsed, devastating the area. \n\nIn the aftermath of the great battle, whatever unity there was in the Dark Lord's domain swiftly began to unravel. Their leadership decapitated, the former servants of the Dark Lord have quickly begun to turn on each other, orc and man, signalling a new era of warfare in the former lands of Sauron. \n\nSimultaneously, the loss of their god has caused a severe crisis of faith for the followers of the Lidless Eye. Many swiftly turned away to other faiths, and the few that were left quickly tore each other apart jockeying for power. The Cult of the Lidless Eye, once pre-eminent faith in Mordor and all Sauron's dominions, has been all but extinguished in the aftermath. \n\nA new age is upon us, one which seems like it shall be dominated by a resurgent kingdom of the Dúnedain. Whatever else, the power of Mordor is broken irrevocably, perhaps forever."

 gondor.2201.desc:0 "Upon opening the great steel case, only two items are held within. Firstly, a chain with a small golden box attached, designed to be worn around the neck. The box has a fine velvet setting within, designed to hold a ring — and it is then that the realization dawns upon the expedition, for this must assuredly be the necklace with which Isildur held the Ruling Ring, after he cut it from the hand of Sauron himself.\n\nNext, however, is the greater prize. A golden cylinder, without marking or ornamentation, rests upon a fine silver pillow. Once it is opened, an audible gasp rises. Attached to a chain of mithril and glowing with an ancient light, a great jewel inlaid in gold and mithril is contained within. This is the Elendilmir, the Star of Elendil, Star of the North Kingdom, borne out of Númenor ere it fell and an heirloom of the northern kingdom. It was lost with Isildur, and since then the Kings of Arnor wore the Lesser Elendilmir, a replica made in its image by the Elves of Imladris. \n\nWith these artifacts, the fate of Isildur is now made clear. It appears his corpse was uncovered by Saruman in his many years of searching for the One, and he stripped it of all its treasures. He then burned the body, in order to remove all traces of Isildur's whereabouts, to slow all who were attempting to uncover the One Ring.\n\nSo now the tale of Isildur can be written in full, both his valour and his failings. Though he fell and his last great choice came to ruin, we must not allow that to diminish his many noble acts, for there is more to a story than its ending."
 gondor.2201.a:0 "Rest in peace, son of Númenor!"

 ### Search the Tower of Orthanc ###
 gondor.2200.t:0 "Search the Tower of Orthanc"
 gondor.2200.desc:0 "Isengard has been without a key-bearer for far too long. After Saruman established himself as Isengard's keeper, the Dúnedain lost swiftly all insight into the happenings of the great tower. Now, with Saruman's treachery revealed and the tower reclaimed, an accounting is in order of what he may have hidden within.\n\nThe first major discovery is an immense store of food of incomparable quality, befitting a king's table — salted pork, fine wines, fowl of every sort of game, potatoes of finest stock, and many other fine delicacies. Most surprising, however, is the discovering of several barrels filled absolutely to the brim with Longbottom Leaf! This leaf is the highest quality in the known world, grown in the Southfarthing of the Shire. It is costly to import from out of the Shire, as Bree is usually the only place such deals can be made.
