 # Introduction to Galadriel
 lotr_intro_events.0001.t:0 "The Lady of Lórien"
 lotr_intro_events.0001.desc:0 "Once, [galadriel.GetFirstName] left the [blessedrealm|E], proud and desiring of a realm of her own. The daughter of Finarfin, son of Finwë, she is said to be among the greatest of the [noldorelves|E], perhaps being second only to [feanor|E] himself. \n\nWhen offered pardon at the end of the [firstage|E], she refused, declaring she had done nothing requiring pardon. She has dwelled in many lands in pursuit of her dream of lordship, and at last, she now has it. In [lothlorien|E], Galadriel has wrought a realm which is her own, fair and beautiful in equal measure, strong and safe.\n\nBut there is a world beyond Lothlorien, and Galadriel knows this well. Long has she battled [sauroncharacter|E] in her mind, and her aid given where it might aid those beyond her borders. Now, with the end of the age drawing near, wise Galadriel sees only two endings for her realm, and herself. Either the bitter victory, or the long defeat at last. Time shall tell."
 lotr_intro_events.0001.a:0 "The Shadow stirs in Dol Guldur. We must act, lest it consumes us."
 lotr_intro_events.0001.att:0 "Once, the realm of [lorien|E] extended to the eves of Fangorn and the Limlight. [men|E] now dwell in the fields of Celebrant, imperiled by the Shadow. Perhaps the time has come to take them under the protection of the [galadhrimelves|E] and reassert the ancient boundaries of Lórien.\n\n#P You send an envoy to the [leofringculture.GetNamePlural] of [GetTitleByKey('d_parth_celebrant').GetNameNoTier], a superstitious but honorable folk, and offer them protection as your vassals.#!"
 lotr_intro_events.0001.b:0 "We must see to our own realm."
 lotr_intro_events.0001.btt:0 "#N You chose to leave the [men|E] outside your realm to their fate to focus on preparing for the great clash with [dolguldur|E].#!"
 
 # Introduction to Thranduil
 lotr_intro_events.0002.t:0 "The Elvenking"
 lotr_intro_events.0002.desc:0 "Born in fallen [GetTitleByKey('k_doriath').GetNameNoTier] in [beleriand|E] of old, [thranduil.GetFirstName] is an [elf|E] whose moods change as the seasons. He can be jovial and kind one moment, and appear stubborn and withdrawn the next. It is a temperament that suits his realm's position. Yet none can doubt the skill or the hard-won wisdom of [thranduil.GetNickname|V]. \n\nRising to the throne after the loss of his father Oropher in the [lastallianceshort|E], the Woodland Realm has withdrawn into a stable but secluded position in the northeast of the [greenwoodshort|E]. Here Thranduil built Aradhrynd, the Halls of the Elvenking, made in the memory of Menegroth of old. But Thranduil did not have the riches of Thingol, nor the aid of the [dwarves|E] in its delving, and so it is smaller - a settlement or stronghold, not a city. Even so, those who visit his subterranean halls speak of finely carved stone wrought in the shape of trees, with great well-lit caverns, shafts bringing air and light.\n\nThranduil is a solitary lord - he concerns himself rarely with the affairs of those outside of his realm, foreboding the evil that dwells beyond it. His borders are harassed by [orcs|E], spiders, and even fallen [conceptracemen|E], defiling the ancient forest which once his people alone had ruled. The vigilance of Thranduil and his people is the shield which protects them. But Thranduil has long known that a day will come when the Shadow will fall once more upon all the forest, and when that day comes, he shall fight."
 lotr_intro_events.0002.a:0 "The fortunes of the world will rise and fall, but here in this kingdom, we will endure."
 
 # Introduction to Elrond
 lotr_intro_events.0003.t:0 "The Lord of Imladris"
 lotr_intro_events.0003.desc:0 "Master [elrondshort|E]. A simple title for an Elda of such high lineage. Born as one of the twin children of Ëarendil and Elwing, Elrond had in him united the royal lines of the [sindarelves|E] and the [noldorelves|E] and the chiefs of [conceptracemen|E]. But for himself he took but the title of 'Master', a loyal councilor and regent to his kin Gil-galad, though King or High-king alike were his to claim.\n\nIn the dwindling days of the [thirdage|E], Elrond has taken over leadership of the Noldor still remaining in [middleearth|E], guiding them from the hidden vale of [imladris|E]. In it he has made a refuge of learning and healing, a homely house where lore and knowledge of yore have been preserved.\n\nYet Elrond knows that the peace of Imladris is an island in a sea of chaos, and for him, all endings of the Third Age are now wrought with peril. If the darkness should finally be ended and all the sorrows of the [elves|E] avenged, then Imladris shall fade, and he depart into the west. If the Darkness should triumph, Imladris may stand alone as a beacon of light ere all others fail.\n\nFor now, he will do what he has always done - give what aid and advice he might, and if neccessary, fight..."
 lotr_intro_events.0003.a:0 "A power slumbers here that may yet endure where all others fail."
 
 # Introduction to Cirdan
 lotr_intro_events.0004.t:0 "The Master of the Havens"
 lotr_intro_events.0004.desc:0 "Long has Cirdan waited, and longer yet will he wait. The Lord of the [greyhavens|E] is one of the oldest [elves|E] remaining in [middleearth|E], for long ago he was charged by [ulmocharacter|E] to build ships to ferry Elves to [valinor|E]. Thus he has done, faithfully fulfilling his duty, serving as tutor and councilor to many who have passed through his havens.\n\nThough [lindon|E] is no longer what it once was, Cirdan rules one of the largest and strongest of the Elven realms left in Middle-earth, even in these waning days. Though he is far-off and removed from the threat to the East, Cirdan will ever do his duty, to the [valargods|E] and to the Free People."
 lotr_intro_events.0004.a:0 "My heart is with the Sea, and I will dwell by the grey shores until the last ship sails."

 # Introduction to Bornmir
 lotr_intro_events.0005.t:0 "The Fate of Sîrgala"
 lotr_intro_events.0005.desc:0 "Once, the kingship of Sîrgala stretched far, to Baranduin in the west and as far north as Lake Nenuial. Though not well-peopled, the semi-migratory [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetName] knew peace and propserity, particularly after King Bornmîr swore fealty to High-king Gil-galad. But the [waroftheelvesandsauron|E] brought great devastation to the lands of the Sîrrandrai, for they were a people who knew little of war. In its wake, many of the survivors fled into Lindon or indeed oversea to [valinor|E], with only a hardy few returning to their ancient lands. Thereafter, much of the lands of the Sîrrandrai were settled by [faithfulshort|El] [dunedain|E] settlers, who acknowledged the authority of the Lord of the Sîrrandrai, but now, the world is changing.\n\nWith the [downfallofnumenor|E] and the establishment of Elendil's kingdom of [arnor|E], many now say the time has come for the Sîrrandrai to place the future of their lands in the hands of their mannish vassals and friends. The [dunedain|E] who owe theoretical fealty to Sîrgala yearn to join him, and Elendil is a honorable soul. Now, Merethorn and Eliniel take counsel to decide the fate of their realm..."
 lotr_intro_events.0005.a:0 "We shall place our trust in Elendil."
 lotr_intro_events.0005.a.tt:0 "You will relinquish the lands of [GetTitleByKey('k_sirgala').GetNameNoTier], integrating it into [GetTitleByKey('k_arthedain').GetNameNoTier]. In exchange, you will become the Warden of [GetTitleByKey('d_emyn_beraid').GetNameNoTier]."
 lotr_intro_events.0005.b:0 "Sîrgala wanes, but is not yet gone!"
 lotr_intro_events.0005.b.tt:0 "We shall not cede our claim to Elendil and the Dunedain. This may have consequences, as the Dunedain settlers in our land desire to join with the High-king..."
 
 # Introduction to Lanthir
 lotr_intro_events.0006.t:0 "The Prince of the Penni"
 lotr_intro_events.0006.desc:0 "Long has Aran Lanthir ruled from his secluded court. Three Ages ago he was a lieutenant of the war leader [tareg|E], and by his side he fought the forces of Darkness in the [battleofpalisor|E]. He joined his captain as he marched West, in the footsteps of his fellow [elves|E] who had departed from [cuivienen|E] many years before. \n\nYet he arrived at the shores of the great inland [seaofrhun|E], and he wished to go no further. For here he discovered a great forest unmarred by evil, and in its depths the Elves discovered shimmering pools graced by the [fay|E]: the least of the [ainurgods|E]. After much debate he and a great many others stayed, and henceforth he was known as the Lord of the [penni|E]; as they would come to be known.\n\nFor the Ages thus they secluded themselves, interacting little with the outside world; and they remembered well the betrayal of those [conceptracemen|E] who fell under the sway of [melkorcharacter|E].\n\nYet Lanthir is not a harsh nor stubborn soul, for he regales in poetry and song, and his court is known as a place of wondrous - if strange - music. In times past he wandered in [greenwoodshort|E] and [lorien|E], and he feasted with Oropher and the Lady of the Golden Wood.\n\nBut now again he secludes himself from the outside world, and as the Darkness surrounds his kingdom, he must make a choice: reach out the wider world, or remain in safe seclusion in his forest kingdom."
 lotr_intro_events.0006.a:0 "Soon we must act, lest the Darkness consume us."

 # Introduction to Maglor
 lotr_intro_events.0008.t:0 "The Last Son of Fëanor" # Title for Maglor intro
 lotr_intro_events.0008.desc:0 "Once, there were seven. Now, I am the last. In folly of youth, despair, love, and rage was an [Concept('oathoffeanor','oath')|E] sworn which drove us to our ruin. To ill end indeed did come all we began well. I will not say no good was done, for good was done. Yet good does not erase evil, even if good comes of it.\n\nFor thousands of years, I wandered the seashore, lamenting. I can scarcely remember those days, the black pit of despair a maw which consumed everything. I did not know of the death of my nephew, not until it was far too late. Yet my deeds and my oath set me still apart from my people, and so I came here, to Himring. Here have I dwelled since. Despite my best efforts, news of my presence became known, and some of my most foolishly loyal followers came and joined me.\n\nWe have built a life, after a fashion. Humble, yet peaceful. Yet even we hear the words carried on the wind and in the seas. The [Concept('sauroncharacter','Darkness')|E] rises anew, and the strength of the Free Peoples is not what once it was. Dare I act?"
 lotr_intro_events.0008.a:0 "I can remain secluded no more." # Rouse himself

 lotr_intro_events.2001.desc:0 "Dain II Ironfoot, King Under the Mountain and the Lord of the Iron Hills has ruled these golden halls for nigh sixty years, sixty years of peace and prosperity for all Dwarvendom following the Battle of the Five Armies, the defeat of Smaug the Terrible and the tragic deaths of Thorin Oakenshield and his sister-sons.\n\nWith Erebor mostly rebuilt from the ravages of the Dragon, the Dwarves look once more beyond their borders to restore the ancient friendships with the Men of Dale and the Elves of the Greenwood, ever keeping a watchful eye to the Northern Wastes, lest any Fire-drakes still living surprise them once more."

 # Introduction to Balin
 lotr_intro_events.2002.t:0 "The Lord of Moria"
 lotr_intro_events.2002.desc:0 "Balin of the Company of Thorin Oakenshield has set out on a grand quest once more - to reclaim the ancient Dwarven capital of Khazad-Dûm from the Orcish stragglers that crawled out of their caverns once more after the fateful Battle of Azanulbizar.\n\nSetting forth from Erebor with a great company of Dwarves against the wishes of King Dain, Balin travelled South and then West along the Old Forest Road passing through danger and strife beneath the boughs of Mirkwood before finally emerging and facing a fierce fight to gain entry to Khazad-Dûm.\n\nHowever, in recent years the company's fortunes have turned. Parties go missing in the deeps of the [mistymountains|E], miners' corpses turn up lacerated, and new colonists from [erebor|E] have slowed to a trickle. And it is rumored that in the depths lurk [goblins|E] waiting for the expedition to misstep.\n\nSeeking guidance, Balin plans to gaze into the depths of the Mirrormere in the hopes of recieving a sign of what he might do to avert this slow death of his colony."

 # Introduction to Gorin of Nordinbad
 lotr_intro_events.2003.t:0 "The Lord of Nordinbad"
 lotr_intro_events.2003.desc:0 "Ever since the days of Gorin's great-grandsire, dwarves have dwelled in Nordinbad. Though the hold was never rich in terms of gold and silver, of iron it has plenty and its beauty is worth more than any mountain of gold, carefully nurtured and enhanced by the faithful Dwarves.\n\nWhile many other dwarf-holds in the Grey Mountains were consumed in Dragon-fire, the lack of conventional wealth steered the devastation away from Nordinbad's peaceful halls, and the Lords therein offered shelter to many survivors, for a time."

I crossed [middleearth|E] when I was half the age he killed that wimpering pale welp of an orc\n\nI can feel it in my body [mahalcharacter|E] is calling me home. To rest.

 # Introduction to Eldberk

 lotr_intro_events.2005.desc:0 "Eldberk, a mere ten winters into his life, witnessed the departure of his father to the fierce War of Dwarves and Orcs. Alas, his father found his final rest in a distant realm, denied the solace of a proper burial. A lingering bitterness took root within Eldberk's heart, for his uncle, Uri VI, returned from that grim conflict, while his father did not.\n\nDriven by a thirst for both renown and retribution, Eldberk embarked upon a daring venture alongside a fellowship, determined to reclaim the once-grand Mansion of Nogrod. Yet, fate had woven a cruel tapestry, for the Halls now lay submerged beneath unruly waters.\n\nNevertheless, the flame of ambition burned undiminished in Eldberk's breast. To emerge triumphant from the depths of adversity would not only quench his vengeful yearning but also carve his name into the annals of Dwarven lore."

 # Introduction to Uri VI

 lotr_intro_events.2006.desc:0 "The sixth reincarnation of Úri, father of the Firebeards, has ruled for countless years. Once he was a great warrior in his own right, and he participated in the War of [dwarves|E] and [orcs|E] when he was young. In that war he fought alongside with and gained the friendship of Dain 'Ironfoot', and with valor and ferocity he led the [firebeard|E] warriors at Azanulbizar.\n\nWhen the exiles of [ereborrealmshort|E] arrived in Eriador, he welcomed them to settle near his hold and funded them, earning him the moniker 'the Generous'. So he has long ruled in peace from his hall in the [bluemountains|E]. \n\nFor unlike Úri the Scarred and his previous incarnations, Úri the Sixth held in his heart great compassion in addition to the stubborness and brashness of the dwarf-fathers. He brought the syncretic belief of Kemnêl-mesêm to the Firebeards, and in his reign he fostered positive relationships with the Elves of Lindon and [broadbeams|E] to the north. \n\nNow in the last years of his life, Úri spends his time at the forge, content and happy."

 # Introduction to Brokkr

 lotr_intro_events.2007.desc:0 "Brokkr II, Lord of the [broadbeams|E] of the [bluemountains|E], has ruled for just over six decades. An ill ruler he has been, and to his credit he knew it well. He drinks into the night, shirking his duties as lord to party and feast. Still the obligations of rule find Brokkr, no matter how far he runs from it, and so he has been consumed by despair and melancholy. \n\nYet for the Broadbeams, there is still glory to be won and ancient might to be reclaimed. Once mighty [belegost|E] lays in ruin, and its tunnels and caverns are ever treacherous, and to reclaim it would take great effort and time. But the Broadbeams, a stable and safe realm, can take their time. \n\nThough it fell in times long forgotten, perhaps Brokkr may redeem his name, and fallen Belegost may be recovered once again."

He set to rousing his raiding bands and gathering booty and food for himself and his followers.

Skulking in the shadows, these squabbling and ambitious underlings saw a chance to take the greatest prize of all, the very throne of the reunified Goblin Town.\n\nNow, the conspirators have raised their banners and laid claim to Gorkil's throne, each one professing to the true title of 'Goblin King'.

His great servant, Angmar, destroyed the North-Kingdom of Arnor, extinguishing the accursed line of Isildur. In the south, Gondor teeters, ready to fall. The Elves have not the might now to throw him back through strength of arms, nor the Dwarves. Soon, the One Ring will reveal itself again, and then there will be nothing that can stand against Sauron. \n\nMiddle-Earth has been abandoned by the Valar and is ready for a new master to put it in order.

Many of the surrounding Woodsmen already dread and fear Dol Guldur, and Khamûl shall leverage this into servitude - yet others remain proud and defiant in independence.\n\nThe Elves of the region are shadows of their former greatness, but even now possess formidable strength. But should their fall come, then the last holdout in the region shall be Dale and Erebor. United with the great host arising in Rhûn, the hammer and anvil will smash the last descendants of the Kingdom of Rhovanion and the seat of the line of Durin."

Though rich and powerful in his own right, he was discontent as the simple second son. He was thus noticed by and quickly taken under the wing of one [annatarcharacter|E], who was none else but [sauroncharacter|E]. Under his tutelage he grew more powerful, growing to a great and skilled sorcerer, and it was then that he was offered a Ring; his one chance for true power. \n\nSo he submitted to Sauron, and forevermore he was bound to his master. An Age later, he would form a new kingdom in the North, and recieve the name that he would forevermore be known as: The Witch-King of [angmar|E]. \n\nBy his hand [arnor|E] was destroyed, reduced to petty clans of [dunedain|E]. Though his kingdom fell, he would join the Dark Tower when it rose again. [minasithil|E], the Tower of the Moon, fell to him; and it would be known as [minasmorgul|E] -- The Tower of Sorcery -- and it would be the personal domain of the Witch-King. \n\nFor a thousand years he has ruled from there, greatest of the servants of [sauronthedarklordcharacter|E]. His presence strikes fear into the hearts of men, and they cower and flee before the Lord of the [nazgulcharacter|E]. By his challenge did Eärnur, last King of Gondor, disappear, and under his leadership [osgiliath|E] was devastated and Ithilien plundered by hordes of Uruks. \n\nThe hour grows late. Gondor is weak. Ithilien is barren. Osgiliath is in ruins. The Lord of Minas Morgul readies his armies; waiting patiently for when the armies of Darkness shall march against Middle-Earth."

The Hillmen of Rhudaur are hardy and resilient folk, molded by the somber weather and the harsh landscape of a long-lost realm, weaving tales of ancient kings and faded glory around their hearthfires. For they contend also with the looming threat of wilderness predators; from ferocious wolves and bears to the savage trolls who descend from the Ettenmoors and lay waste to the land.\n\nThrough generations of hardship and seclusion, the tribes of [rhudaur|e] have preserved fragmented legends of Arnor's past, speaking in hushed tones of [elendil|e], [isildur|e], and the Tower of Amon Sûl. Yet, these stories are but shadows, bereft of factual detail, shrouded by the passage of ages and the isolation of their mountain fastness. In this forgotten corner of Middle-earth, survival is the paramount concern, and the tales of bygone kings serve as a bittersweet reminder of a heritage that lingers like mist upon the hills, elusive and intangible."

At the tender age of two, his father Arathorn perished to an orc arrow, and Aragorn was spirited by his mother Gilraen to Rivendell, where he was raised by Lord Elrond Peredhel as his foster-son.\n\nAt the age of twenty-one, Elrond revealed to his foster-son the truth of his high heritage, relinquishing to him the ring of Barahir and the shards of Narsil he had in his keeping, retaining only the sceptre of Annúminas. After this he fell in love with Arwen Undómiel, and she him, but Elrond set before Aragorn a task. He would only give his blessing for his daughter to marry Aragorn if he became the High-King of Arnor and Gondor, earning the Sceptre of Annúminas he had withheld.\n\nAragorn set out into the Wild, and traveling afar did many great deeds for the Free Peoples. Time shall tell if Aragorn achieves all he has hoped, or if the Heir of Isildur is doomed to share the fate of his forefathers."

Once among the last refuges of the native Eriadorim, the inhabitants of the Hills merged with the Dúnedain settlers and in time adopted Anorian identity. Yet the Uialdain retained their bucolic traditions and the preservation of songs from faroff days.\n\nSheltered by their hills a few survived the fall of Arnor, but unlike their Northern Dúnedain kin - who helped to preserve their secret existence - they fled not to the wilds but remained in their vales, largely returning to the pastoral existence practised here since the Elder Days, when the Edain pastured their flocks in Eriador, before ever they met the Eldar. \n\nSulendil is of a proud line, counting a younger son of Arvedui as the founder of his house. But his dwindling people retain only a folk memory of their enobled ancestry, and are largely uninterested in outside affairs. For the most part the 'Return of the King' is a proposition believed only by children.

The clans of the Saralain have ever been bound more by blood and kinship than oaths of fealty, but even still, the kings possessed some authority to guide and govern the clans. \n\nWell, not for many years has that been the case. Now, the authority of Saralain in truth has been reduced to the lands of Ironwarf itself. Madogh's ascension has brought mixed reactions - his cruelty and short temper have alienated those who might have been his allies, but at the same time has also given birth to hope that he might have the iron needed to reforge the clans of Saralain into a united people once more."

 lotr_intro_events.6201.desc:0 "For twenty-five generations the Stewards of Gondor have kept a vigilant watch over the lands of Gondor, serving as its keepers and highest authority until the return of a rightful claimant to its kingship. Hardships—innumerable and often terrible, have come to pass during these times. There is no peace, for the men of Gondor can afford no such relief. Men are raised into soldiers instead of scholars; and iron is wrought into devices meant for war and nothing else.\n\nThe kingdom’s strength is waning. To the East a Great Shadow stirs. A nameless fear besieges the eastern shore. Patrols vanish without a word, and tradesmen are harried along the coasts. The decisive hour approaches, and for the kingdom of Gondor to endure it will need the likes Cirion or Ecthelion to lead its peoples.\n\nIn this hour, the burden lies upon the Steward Denethor II. He is a man loved by few, grim and stern by nature, often secluded in the White Tower. His bearing is as a king of old, shrewd and wise in his conduct and policy, and guided by his steely will Gondor has endured increasingly terrible odds. But a shadow is upon the heart of the steward, and as the long years of his watch lengthen, despair finds root within the whispering dark. \n\nUncertain, is the future of Gondor. It stands on a razor’s edge, and a single breeze could cast it down into the depths of darkness. But likewise, it could perhaps be restored to its former greatness just as quickly. Whatever might occur, in this moment the looming shadow moves ever-westward, encompassing all with its darkness and destruction..."

These are the leader of the Citadel Guard, bearer of the Horn of Gondor, and head of the armies of Gondor after the Steward himself. No man was ever born more suited to the role than Boromir, elder son of the Steward Denethor. \n\nLoved and respected by his people and his men, Boromir is a man of the make of King Eärnur. Bearing great strength and valour, he is an honourable man, with a burning desire to see his people safe from the encroaching shadow. He is not a man much concerned with the old lore and wisdoms, save in the tales of old battles, and his zeal for his country may be yet his salvation or his damnation. \n\nTo the Captain of the White Tower Gondor looks, and upon him is its hope laid and remain, lest some hope unlooked for comes to rally the people once more."

Faramir would rather he never had to bear a sword, preferring the tales of yore and the library to any war song and battlefield. Yet in these dwindling days, all sons of Gondor must fight for her safety, and Faramir has taken up his burden gladly to defend the last cities of the sons of Númenor. While Boromir leads the men of Gondor openly as Captain of the White Tower, Faramir's task is more subtle, but just as important. As their Captain, he leads the Ithilien Rangers, the forward-guard of Gondor. From the trees do his men strike, harassing and hampering the forces of the Enemy. Many a force has been ended before Boromir's brave forces could ever face them by Faramir's solemn watch. \n\nBut a day will soon come when Faramir may be asked to burden an inheritance he never dreamed or feared would be his."

Whatever the truth, none can deny the bearing and long nobility of the line of the Princes of Belfalas, who have borne that title since the days of Elendil.\n\nThe Princes of Dol Amroth are second in dignity and honour in Gondor only to the Kings and the Stewards, and their princedom has endured where other mighty ones have fallen into decay and destruction. Their pride and joy are their knights, in whom some of the strength of Númenor still endures, and the thunder of the hooves of Dol Amroth have set many a foe to flight.\n\nIn these days of dwindling might and growing dread, Gondor leans ever-more on her mightiest princes.

The native Andrastim have long left us alone, particularly those which in ages past paid homage to Gondor. To our west, the Castellans of Úlond, the ancient royal residence, while unwilling to acknowledge our claim as per our ancient governate, were at least tolerable.\n\nBut three years ago, a group of rash Umbarean reavers overthrew the small garrison in Úlond overnight and the line of Castellans was ended. Since then they have been raiding the surrounding lands under the leadership of the one they call the 'Black Drake of Andrast', who took the daughter of the last castellan as his wife. He has reportedly treated the people of his province with a relatively fair hand, ruling with his own contorted sense of honor. However, this does bring opportunity - the Retreat of Kings is without a legitimate ruler and my men have been rallying for me to restore our ancient right and retake Bar Morthil for Gondor."

That night, I was hailed as the Black Drake by my men, the beast that comes at night to bring terror and pillage. I took the daughter of the last Castellan as my bride and Bar Morthil has been my base of operations ever since - We have raided the nearby Andrastim tribes and the Dúnedain alike.\n\nBut my ambition is not sated, it will never be until I am either King of this land or a corpse beneath its cliffs."

 lotr_intro_events.7505.desc:0 "Imrazôr, Prince of Alsarias, is a man of intense passions. Most steadfast friend, most dire foe, he burns hot and cold in equal measure. A man in the make of his [numenorean|E] forefathers, he knows his desires and will work tirelessly to see them fulfilled.\n\nHis most heartfelt desire is to marry the lovely Princess Arimîth of Karasalas, whom he has long held a torch for. She has, in recent years, come to reciprocate his feelings, and for this, Imrazôr is overjoyed.\n\nYet there remains an obstacle in the way of this happiest of endings. For the Prohibition of Unification, long-enshrined in the Grand Concordant, denies the right of two sovereign princes of the [balan_lai|E] to wed, to prevent the consolidation of their realms and upsetting the balance of power. And thus, Imrazôr and Arimîth are barred. Yet a glimmer of hope remains. For the Prohibition may be lifted on a per case basis by approval of the council of the [balan_lai|E] - and now Imrazôr III turns all his considerable gifts of wit and charm to the task of ensuring that it comes to pass."

 # Introduction to Seregul
 lotr_intro_events.7506.t:0 "The Fallout of the Council of 3000"
 lotr_intro_events.7506.desc:0 "Seregul, Prince of Pel, has ever been a most proud Adûnâi. In his veins flows the blood of [numenor|E], his ancestors elevated above lesser Men! For this reason, Seregul stews in wroth, for he is saddled with Pel. And Pel alone sees its Adûnâi Prince constrained, for he must rule jointly with a native conclave. Such was the agreement made when the [balan_lai|E] were invited to the region back in T.A. 1203, and which has been maintained ever since.\n\nHis wife is no aid in his trials either. Never was there love between them, and whatever kindness briefly lived has long died. Now it seems Seregul's lack of grace has come back to haunt him. For in the summoned council of the year 3000, many decided they could bear him no more, and denounced him. They swore not to acknowledge the Prince's decrees until he was removed and a new one elected - and mayhaps even not then.\n\nThe [balan_lai|E] has taken a dim view of the matter, and deemed it an internal affair for Seregul to handle - no aid shall come from the west. Likely they mean to give him enough rope to hang himself! Where others see trial, Seregul sees an opportunity - to show everybody his true might, and to finally break free of his ancestral shackles. And then they shall all regret spurning him..."

 # Introduction to Derei
 lotr_intro_events.7507.t:0 "The Young Price"
 lotr_intro_events.7507.desc:0 "Gimilêth, the southernmost of the Princedoms of the [balan_lai|E], has long enjoyed a close relationship with the [cuind|E] of the bordering Kingdom of Drêl, such that it is an open secret that many [cuind|E] travel in disguise throughout the land, offering their services as healers, woodworkers and more. It is even rumoured that a number of the Princes of Gimilêth have entered the forest of Drêl and studied with the [elves|E]. \n\nAfter the death of his father to a sudden illness and with no surviving close relations, the young Prince's fate seemed uncertain - until of course the [elven|E]-king Terilaen of Drêl took the young boy under his tutorship. Though Prince Derei is no longer a child, he still relies heavily on the advice and guidance of his friend and tutor, perhaps heralding a new age of friendship between Drêl and Gimilêth?"

 # Introduction to Arimîth
 lotr_intro_events.7508.t:0 "The Jewel of the Southlands"
 lotr_intro_events.7508.desc:0 "Arimîth, Princess of Karsalas, is as cunning as she is fair. The only child of her father, he passed suddenly at a young age, leaving the so-called 'Jewel of the Southlands', as the Princess was known, in a precarious position. Her two uncles were quick to pounce, and it was only with the pressure of Phorakôn, leader of the [balan_lai|E], that they backed off.\n\nYet Arimîth was not cowed, for following that incident she has grown into a shrewd, confident, and cautious leader; worthy of her position as a Princess of the [balan_lai|E]. Since then, however, there has been a new player in her life.\n\nProud and passionate Imrazôr III, Prince of Alsarias, has long sought Arimîth's heart. Whereas once she was uncertain, over the long period of courtship she has come to return his affections.\n\nYet for their tale of love to come to a conclusion, there is much yet to be done, for romance may yet influence the future of the [balan_lai|E]."

 # Introduction to Daroc III
 lotr_intro_events.7511.t:0 "The Clubfooted"
 lotr_intro_events.7511.desc:0 "Daroc III, Prince of Hammerdal, is a man of no small stature. A lifelong cripple, Daroc's clubfeet and limp had caused many to believe that he would be unfit to rule over the martial men of Hammerdal. In his youth he faced a raiding force of [anbalkumagan|E], and crushed a man's skull in its helmet. Any uncertainty would soon be forgotten.\n\nTo Daroc, his limp is nothing more than an extra challenge to overcome. He is the greatest in size and most ferocious in battle of all the Princes of the [balan_lai|E], and there are scarce few who do not fear facing him even in his middle age.\n\nYet with the Stormhost rising once more in the north, it is his realm that shall first face total assault, and there is no certainty if his fellow Princes shall come to his aid."

 # Introduction to Szoranh, the dragon at world's end
 lotr_intro_events.7512.t:0 "The Dragon and his Scarlet Blades"
 lotr_intro_events.7512.desc:0 "Szoranh was once a nameless deckhand. Born with a disfigured left foot, he was little use as a combatant. Ambitious despite his deformity, Szoranh was often seen ashore learning to read and count coin. This changed rather suddenly when he met Bhalrim.\n\nThe Scarlet Sword was a feared warrior in Vulmaw, for the joy he took in the suffering of his foes. Content to act the part of wandering sword for hire, Bhalrim never chose to tie himself to any master. Yet it would seem that Szoranh and Bhalrim were a duo set upon each other's paths by fate, for they swiftly formed a deep bond and carried out plans to usurp a fleet and sail for a land of oppertunity.\n\nThe Balan Lai are vulnerable. Pel crumbles as a dome struck with thunderous force, while in the north Szoranh hears tell of some host of men that moves as a storm across the land. Surely any such army would be a welcome ally to the Freed of Kadir.\n\nWherever the pair strikes, they carry the legacy of Womawas and Kadir further than ever before into the west of Middle earth."
