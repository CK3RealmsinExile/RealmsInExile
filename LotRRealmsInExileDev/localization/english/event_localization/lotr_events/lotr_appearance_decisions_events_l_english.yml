 lotr_appearance_decisions_events.4000.t: "Commissioning a Mask"
 lotr_appearance_decisions_events.4000.desc: "I find myself once more staring at my disfigured face in the mirror. I've been catching myself doing this more often since I removed the bandages and chose to show my face to the world. The more I look, the more disgusted I become by what stares back at me. The familiar lines of my face have been forever altered, and I'm unsure how I can continue to see myself this way.\n\nI realize I must do something to save myself from this torment. I cannot rule if I cannot focus on anything except the broken horror that stares back at me from every reflection..."
 lotr_appearance_decisions_events.4000.a: "A mask to cover the disfigurement will suit me."
 lotr_appearance_decisions_events.4000.b: "I must cover my entire face!"
 lotr_appearance_decisions_events.4000.c: "No, I am [disfigured_root.GetNameNoTooltip]! I do not need a mask!"

 lotr_appearance_decisions_events.4001.t: "Showing My Face to the World"
 lotr_appearance_decisions_events.4001.desc: "Just as I have done every morning since commissioning my mask, I place the leather strap around my scalp and feel the cold, unforgiving metal fall upon my broken visage. With a heavy sigh, I cross the room, take the hand mirror from the side table, and raise it to my face.\n\nI look into the mirror with disgust. A coward who was too afraid to show [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] true self to the world... Not for the first time, I wonder if I should leave the mask in my chambers and hold court with my face uncovered, just as it is."
 lotr_appearance_decisions_events.4001.a: "I will remove my mask and show my face to the world once more!"
 lotr_appearance_decisions_events.4001.b: "No, I can't bare it."
