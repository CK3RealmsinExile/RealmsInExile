 ### ROHAN KING EVENTS ###
 rohan.0100.t: "Status of the Northern Border"
 rohan.0100.desc: "Since the days of [eorl.GetFirstName]'s great ride south, some of our kin lingered in the southern [anduinvale|E] - those we now name the [leofr.GetCulture.GetCollectiveNoun]. Some time after our own settlement of [rohan|E], they migrated southward due to pressure from the north, settling between the Mark and [mirkwood|E].\n\nYet in the past century, some of them have passed even into Rohan proper. Harried by [orcs|E] and Fell Things coming out of Mirkwood, many sought the protection of our strength. As our kin, we welcomed them, and they acknowledged the authority of [GetTitleByKey('b_edoras').GetNameNoTier] and Eorl's line. They settled the sparse lands of our northeast, where our own folk have long herded cattle. Some of their number proved skilled and wise, becoming local leaders of the region even over my own people.\n\nYet increasingly the lands the Leofrings settled in [GetTitleByKey('d_thewold').GetNameNoTier] and [GetTitleByKey('d_eastemnet').GetNameNoTier] seem to act without thought for Edoras or Rohan. This must be rectified, and soon, or the northeast border may collapse under the orcish raids it now suffers."
 rohan.0100.a: "Let us remind our kin to whom they owe fealty"
 rohan.0100.b: "Let them handle the Orcs alone, if they care not for their oaths"

 rohan.0101.opening: "My Errant Subjects,"
 rohan.0101.desc: "[sender.GetTitledFirstName] calls upon you to uphold your allegiance to Eorl's line and safeguard the territories of [GetTitleByKey('k_rohan').GetNameNoTier]. Not long ago, we allowed you to settle our northern frontier, as we recognized you as kin of the Éothéod. The time has come to renew your oaths, to protect the lands of [GetTitleByKey('d_thewold').GetNameNoTier] against the rising threat from Mirkwood."
 rohan.0101.a: "We swear fealty to you, [sender.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], King of Rohan"
 rohan.0101.b: "We owe you no loyalty!"
 
 rohan.0102.opening: "True Heir of Eorl,"
 rohan.0102.desc: "We renew our oaths to you, [sender.GetTitledFirstName]. You are the true king of [GetTitleByKey('k_rohan').GetNameNoTier], and we will serve the Mark with pride. Together we will stand against the shadow rising in the North."
 rohan.0102.a: "A wise choice."
 
 rohan.0103.opening: "King of the Mark,"
 rohan.0103.desc: "You cannot protect us from the rising shadow! We will find our own path, without you. We owe you no loyalty."
 rohan.0103.a: "Fools."
 
 rohan.1100.t: "The [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] in the Golden Hall"
 rohan.1100.desc: "Biting wind greets me as the heavy doors of the Meduseld are opened before me. Flags bearing my insignia whip in the cool morning air, and my breath comes out in a white vapor. Dawn lights the rim of the [whitemountains|E] with a pure fire, casting long shadows of the peaks across the plains of Harrowdale.  The long silver line of the Snowbourn courses dimly through the steppe, at this early hour yet untouched by the eye of the sun. A member of my council appears at my side and greets me. “My lord, your people work diligently, but their hands would find new strength if they had sight of their king. Would you deign to make an appearance for your people?”"
 rohan.1100.a: "“I will ride as far as the Entwash with the patrol.”"
 rohan.1100.b: "“I will attend to the stables.”"
 rohan.1100.c: "“I will observe the training of new recruits.”"
 rohan.1100.d: "“My time is better spent on statecraft.”"
 
 rohan.1101.t: "The Entwash"
 rohan.1101.desc: "My armour gleams in the sunlight as I ride alongside my veteran patrol, a shining column splitting the grasses. I feel the proud history of my folk and land in the sound of the hoofbeats of my warriors. I recall Eorl the Young, and Brego, and I stretch my horse out, straining over the hills, taking the lead in my company. The bodies of my mounted soldiers' stream over the golden fields of my homeland like liquid. My prideful exuberance is met with a quick check, however! Rising over the crest, my steed stumbles and begins to fall! I…"
 rohan.1101.a: "Attempt to leap from the falling horse and land on my feet."
 rohan.1101.b: "Lean back and attempt to steady my horse."
 rohan.1101.c: "Accept my fate and try to fall with dignity."
 
 rohan.1102.t: "Edoras Stables"
 rohan.1102.desc: "I descend the well laid steps of Edoras beside the chattering stream towards the stables beside the gate. The sounds of the hammering of iron and the nickering of horses precede the appearance of the structures. In these long halls the steeds of my people have been kept and tended since the days of Eorl the Young. The bright eyes of my people follow me as I make my way between the steaming piles of dung and the cooling works of the blacksmiths. I decide to pay special attention to the…"
 rohan.1102.a: "Farriers."
 rohan.1102.b: "Groomers."
 rohan.1102.c: "Saddlers."
 
 rohan.1103.t: "Recruits"
 rohan.1103.desc: "I descend the well laid steps of Edoras beside the chattering stream towards the training grounds beside the gate. The sounds of yelled admonitions and encouragements and the clashing of steel precede the appearance of the structures. In these dusty, foot trampled grounds, my people have trained the new line of warriors since the days of Eorl the Young. The veteran soldiers snap to attention when they catch sight of my presence touring the grounds and correct the recruits with renewed vigour. I approach a rack of training blades and grip one by the hilt, testing its weight in my hand with a few practice swings. A nearby recruit watches my technique with interest. I decide to test the strength of my fresh recruits and invite him to spar. I…"
 rohan.1103.a: "Attack viciously, pressuring the youngster with powerful strikes."
 rohan.1103.b: "Protect myself and observe his strikes."
 rohan.1103.c: "Trip him when he approaches to strike."
 
 rohan.1105.desc: "In a tremendous show of strength and acrobatics I leap from the falling horse and land just as my riders overtake me. They are amazed at my ability both in and outside of the saddle. My horse rises to its feet and it is but a moment's work to steady the frantic animal and remount, to the admiring gaze of my soldiers."
 rohan.1106.desc: "With a foolhardy attempt to leap from the saddle of a falling horse I am flung face-first down the hill, cartwheeling ridiculously through the air. I land in an undignified heap a length from my fallen steed. I dust myself off and remount as my soldiers discreetly avert their eyes."
 
 rohan.1107.desc: "I greet the panic with the steady will of an experienced rider, countering my horses' stumble by leaning back in the saddle. My horse steadies itself and I fly down the hill with only a slight hitch in my stride. I don't turn to look around, but I am sure my riders admire the display of practiced riding I've just demonstrated."
 rohan.1108.desc: "Attempting to check my steed's slide proves fruitless as I topple and am dumped unceremoniously to the ground. I dust myself off as my riders overtake me and wait for me to steady my steed and remount. I continue on with no more mention of it."
 
 rohan.1109.desc: "Recognizing the inevitable fall I brace myself and hit the ground solidly beside my horse, avoiding it's falling body. My riders catch up and laugh alongside me as I coax my steed to its feet. Falls are a part of riding, and a little dustier for the event, I continue on, having risen slightly perhaps in the estimation of my soldiers for my ability to take a fall."
 rohan.1110.desc: "I opt for the safest option, but luck is not with me today! My steed pitches forward at the last moment and sends me face first into the hillside. My helmet prevents too grave an injury, but nevertheless I am left picking grass out of my teeth as my soldiers divert their gaze."
 
 rohan.1111.desc: "I return at the closing of the day, leading the line of my spent riders. My horses trot, lathered from the day, steadily making their way towards their feedbags. The shadows of the [whitemountains|E] have once again swallowed the valley, and the grasses of the plains seem to have taken an early bed, untroubled by wind. The Simbelmynë alike slumber upon the graves of the Barrowfield, the patches of white flowers seeming to glow from some inner radiance, absent the rays of the sun. I am reminded of an old song, and as I lead the patrol slowly past the Doorward and into Edoras, the old tongue runs unbidden through my mind,\n\n\n\nWhere now the horse and rider?\n\nWhere is the horn that was blowing?\n\nWhere is the helm and the hauberk,\n\nand the bright hair flowing?\n\nWhere is the hand on the harpstring,\n\nand the red fire glowing?\n\nWhere is the spring and the harvest\n\nand the tall corn growing?\n\nThey have passed like rain on the mountain,\n\nlike a wind in the meadow;\n\nThe days have gone down in the West\n\nbehind the hills into shadow.\n\nWho shall gather the smoke of the dead wood burning.\n\nOr behold the flowing years from the Sea returning?"
 
 rohan.1112.desc: "The roof of the Meduseld shines like a beacon in the late afternoon sun as I ride attended by a single escort toward Edoras. Following my fall, I elected to return on a solitary ride and let my patrol continue to complete their circuit. The fall I experienced earlier left a bitter taste in my mouth, and I try not to hold it against the steed so powerfully bearing me across these last folds of hill before home. I wonder if the blood which long ago settled and tamed these lands has weakened with time and left me less vigorous than the Horse Lords of old. I pass the Barrowfield and the lightly tossing heads of the Simbelmynë without a word and slip back past the Doorward and into my homestead."
 
 rohan.1113.desc: "I duck into the farrier's workshop. He has a horse's foot under his arm and is levelling the hoof with a rasp. A pile of iron horseshoes lies stacked, ready to be fitted. I watch silently as he fits the shoe, then admire his work, to his surprise. He thanks me and stammers over his words in my presence. I leave satisfied with the quality of his work, and certain that he will continue his high level of quality."
 rohan.1114.desc: "The fierce spirited horses of Rohan are tended in this workshop, their hair trimmed and coat brushed. The men and women who work here are more familiar with the horse's bodies than their own. I watch approvingly and offer some advice when I feel it is warranted. They scrub out their teeth and braid their manes. The mood of the groomers feels elevated as I return toward my hall."
 rohan.1115.desc: "The smell of leather is thick as I approach the saddlers workshop. Straps for stirrups and reins hang from the walls, and on a wooden frame a saddle is being crafted. I watch the saddler working the treated leather onto the seat and around the horn. Thick needles are pushed through the leather to sew. I admire the handiwork and congratulate the saddler on his industry, and leave, feeling that the saddler will perform with renewed purpose after my visit."
 
 rohan.1116.desc: "As I climb the hewn stone of the broad path winding upward toward Meduseld I reassure myself of the industry and ability of my stables. The blood of the Horse Lords courses unbroken through my veins, and likewise through the veins of my people. Masters of the steed, I have no doubt the horses of Rohan will be as swift as any in the land, and better equipped. I pass the stone carved in the likeness of a horse from which gush the waters of the stream running through the heart of Edoras. I climb the green terrace, flanked by the shining silver of my guard's armour, and survey once again the extent of my land, the sun now glancing brightly off the Snowbourn, coursing its way through the land of the Horse Lords. The heavy doors of the Golden Hall are swung inwards, and I enter again, freshly renewed, to address the maintenance of my land."
 
 rohan.1117.desc: "My muscles remember their martial training as I advance with confident steps towards the young man in his ill-fitting armour. Keeping the point of my sword active I strike and toss aside his weak parries with ease. A meagre deflection keeps his blade horizontal, and with a powerful downward strike I knock it aside and stop only when the point of my blade rests against the young man's chest. The surrounding soldiers who had paused their efforts to watch resume their training with a renewed purpose."
 rohan.1118.desc: "The young recruit circles me nervously, my sword tracking his movements. Suddenly I lunge at him, striking at his defence and willing my sword to penetrate it. But alas! A wrong step sends me sliding in the mud, and I drop to a knee, covering my fresh linens in mud. The recruit pauses, not able to bring his sword against me, even in practice. Those who had been watching avert their eyes and the practice resumes around me."
 
 rohan.1119.desc: "I silently match the movements of the young recruit, and goad him on to attack me. The youth swallows his reluctance and strikes with a yell! I block deftly and step to the side, my sword point swinging past his throat. He gathers himself again and charges! I deflect his blade and catch his grip with my hand, using his momentum to cast him into the mud. I grin and help him to his feet with encouraging words, and the practice resumes around me."
 rohan.1120.desc: "I circle the young recruit, matching his movements, goading him to strike me. He charges with a flurry, which I easily cast aside. He feints to the left, and I am not quick enough to catch it and fall for his deceit. With a triumphant gleam in his eye his blade spins over mine and I am caught off balance. I swing my sword to the side just in time to catch his attack but are left kneeling in the mud with the exertion of the counter. Practice resumes, more subdued than before, around me."
 
 rohan.1121.desc: "I settle into a defensive pose, and my blade follows the young recruit as he circles me. Just as he rushes to attack me, I tap his blade aside with my point and spin under him, extending my foot and catching him just as he passes. He is thrown bodily into the mud, and there is the general sound of laughter around the grounds. I stoop, smiling to pull him from the muck, his face wearing a scarlet blush. I encourage him with some words and sheath my sword, and practice resumes around the grounds."
 rohan.1122.desc: "I adopt a defensive posture as he circles me, and goad him on. He rushes me, and I deflect the point of his sword with ease. I crouch and kick out with my foot to trip him, but he leaps over my attack and bears down on my turned back. With a display of athleticism, I manage to spin and counter, but am thrown off balance and drop to one knee in the mud. Those who had been watching avert their eyes as I struggle back up to my feet, congratulating the young recruit on his perceptiveness and adaptability."
 
 rohan.1123.desc: "I clap my hand on the shoulder of the young recruit and offer him some encouraging words, and his eyes shine with renewed purpose. I think I see in him the strength of the old horse lords that settled this valley and tamed the land for my people. I replace the nicked sword in its stand, and the clamour of clashing swords and shouting voices reassert themselves in the day, the sun climbing fast overhead towards noon. I tour the remainder of the grounds, enjoying the struggle of the young soldiers learning their trade. I feel confidence swelling in my chest that these men will be able to provide for my kingdom and serve as a bulwark against those that would do my people ill. I complete the circuit and with some parting words of encouragement to the veterans I reascend the hewn steps rising to the Golden Hall. The heavy doors are swung inwards for me, and I return to the maintenance of my land."
 rohan.1124.desc: "I replace the nicked sword in its stand and try to ignore the mud coating the knee of my pants. The clamour of the training grounds, of clashing steal and shouting, return but with a more subdued tone. I tour the grounds with my escort, observing the efforts of the young soldiers. It seems they are approaching manhood less able than those of my age did, but perhaps this is merely the bias of age speaking. Banners that line the wall of Edoras hang limp against their poles, and the promising morning has faded into something of a dour day, grey clouds obscuring the peaks of the [whitemountains|E] the sun clambered over so recently. I complete a circuit and offer some encouraging words to the veterans before ascending once again the hewn stones that rise to Meduseld. The heavy doors of the Golden Hall are swung inward, and I enter to attend again to the maintenance of my land."
 
 ### DEATH OF ÉOMUND, AND ÉOMER and ÉOWYN'S TUTELAGE ###
 rohan.1200.t: "Orcs Spotted in the Emyn Muil"
 rohan.1200.desc: "As Chief Marshal of the Riddermark, Éomund has spent many years defending the Eastmark from the encroaching raids of [orcs|E] that come from the Emyn Muil. Now, another raiding party has emerged from those stony and impenetrable hills to raid the wide plains of Rohan. But there are few places to hide on the open plains of Rohan from the thundering hooves of the Rohirrim, and so Éomund heads out to humble the Orcs once again."
 rohan.1200.a: "Rally the men! We ride at dawn!"
 
 rohan.1201.t: "A Quiet Journey"
 rohan.1201.desc: "It is far too quiet. Normally we would have come upon the [orcs|E] by now; they are a disorganised and incompetent race by nature. But even as we have ridden ever closer to the Emyn Muil, we still have not found the reported orcband. At last, we came upon them, fleeing into the Emyn Muil, laden with a light amount of booty, evidently unwilling to push their luck. I order my men to ride hard — do not let these foul raiders escape! \n\nThen, out of the twisted trees and obscuring rocks that have slowly risen around us shrills horns sound, and all at once the unnatural silence makes sense."
 rohan.1201.a: "We are ambushed!"
 
 rohan.1202.t: "Ambush at Emyn Muil"
 rohan.1202.desc: "In all my years of watching the Eastmark, never have I experienced such coordination from [orcs|E]! Who is leading them? \n\nSuch thoughts race my mind as my riders desperately attempt to break out of the craftily wrought trap. But for all their valour, they are but men, and men bleed and die regardless of cowardice or courage. Men scream in terror as they are ripped from their horses or pierced by arrows. I am struck by an arrow that pierces my side, and then, there is only the dark..."
 rohan.1202.a: "Argh!"
 
 rohan.1203.t: "A Widow's Grief"
 rohan.1203.desc: "We became worried after Éomund had not returned after a week. Riders sent to search finally found him... dead near the Emyn Muil, an orc-arrow piercing his side. My dear, valiant husband, you have gone, and I remain in sorrow and bitter ash. How can I go on... \n\nThéodwyn did not last long after her husband's death. Those near her are unsure how much of her quick decline was the disease, and how much of it was the despair. But the result is the same — she was dead, and her two children left behind."
 rohan.1203.a: "My children..."
 
 rohan.1204.t: "Orphans of the Eastfold"
 rohan.1204.desc: "Father... mother... what am I to do? I am not ready to rule. I expected to have many more years before I had to step into your shoes. We are both besides ourselves with grief. \n\nI was relieved when a messenger came from Edoras bearing a message from my mother's brother, King Théoden. He expressed his grief, and his sorrow for me and my sister. He bids that we come to Edoras, to be trained and educated, saying that while an uncle is a poor substitute for a father, he will try. There is no question of our answer. To Meduseld we shall go."
 rohan.1204.a: "Uncle Théoden will look after us."
 
 rohan.1205.t: "The Marshal of the Eastfold"
 rohan.1205.desc: "I kneel before my royal uncle in the hall which has, for many years now, been my home; Golden Meduseld, the hall of Kings. I bear the armour I have earned through brutal training and practice, with the horse-hair helm placed atop my head. \n\nUncle bids me to rise, and before the court, speaks of how Eowyn and I had come to Meduseld, and how through sorrow we have both grown to be fine youths. He finishes his speech by bidding Háma to come to him, bearing a fine sword. Seizing it, he bids me take it, and in doing so take up my father's seat and honours. I am to be Third Marshal of the Riddermark, and guardian of the East, as my father was before me. \n\nI shall not forget your kindness and love, Uncle."
 rohan.1205.a: "I will make my father proud."
 
 rohan.1206.t: "The Shieldmaiden of Rohan"
 rohan.1206.desc: "I have lived a conflicted life since coming to Edoras. While the people love me throughout the capital as the 'White Lady of Rohan', I find my martial desires to be stifled under the worried eyes of my royal uncle. In spite of his silent disapproval, I have trained with sword and shield until I could stand my ground against any of the knights of his guard. I am a daughter of Kings, Shieldmaiden of the Riddermark, though Théoden King won't let me ride in battle."
 rohan.1206.a: "I fear only a cage, while those I love ride against the Enemy."
 
 rohan.1207.t: "The Marshal of the Eastmark"
 rohan.1207.desc: "With my inheritance finally secured and my subjects pledged to my name, I can finally strive to live a normal life amongst my people. Perhaps now would be the time to seek a suitable wife? \n\nHowever, with the ever-looming shadow of Darkness lingering upon the fringes of the kingdom, is marriage in this hour of need truly wise? Perhaps I should focus my efforts in the service of the people of Rohan rather than myself."
 rohan.1207.a: "Marriage can wait! Rohan needs me now more than ever!"
 rohan.1207.b: "I cannot wait! My father's line must endure!"
 
 rohan.1208.t: "The Princess of Dol Amroth"
 rohan.1208.desc: "Through the renown of my great deeds of arms I have come into contact with the gallant Prince Imrahil of Dol Amroth. For many months we have written to one-another about matters of state and foreign affairs, critiquing each other's plans and tactics for the wars to come. \n\nThese talks were of a formal nature, meant for our own benefit in the realm of combat...Which is why when the Prince suddenly decided to broach more personable topics in one of his latest letters I was quite taken aback. From what I have read, he is much like myself. A man of fire; of the open fields ridden upon horseback. We have come to an understanding of one-another, and I am glad to call him my friend. \n\nHis latest letter to me, however, is of great import to my future. He has offered me the hand of his youngest child. His daughter, Lothíriel. From what he tells me of her, she is a fair maiden of untold virtue, and to see her wed me would make him awfully glad. \n\nIs this the opportunity I have been awaiting all these tireless years for? A calm in the storm of our world. A bride worth more than entire kingdoms, mine; and all I need do is say yes..."
 rohan.1208.a: "She is a creature unlike any other; beautiful and pure..."
 rohan.1208.b: "I am but a simple man, not worthy of such beauty."
 
 rohan.1209.t: "The Princess of Dol Amroth"
 rohan.1209.desc: "It is said that in a ceremony most grand, the High King Aragorn took to wife the beautiful maiden of Dol Amroth, Lothíriel. Theirs is a union of prestige and bloodlines, the two kindreds come together once again in a final union to signal the beginning of a new age for Men. \n\nPerhaps now it would be wise to seek a wife of my own?"
 rohan.1209.a: "Yes, it was foolish of me to wait this long."

### OATH OF EORL EVENTS ###
 
 rohan.2000.t: "The Red Arrow"
 rohan.2000.desc: "A rider from Gondor has arrived at the court of the King of the Riddermark, bearing the ancient Red Arrow. This arrow once summoned south Eorl the Young in his legendary ride and is symbolic of the ancient friendship and alliance of Gondor and Rohan. Eorl and the Steward Cirion swore a great oath, that they should share friend and foe alike, and many times has that oath been called upon by both sides.\n\nThat the arrow should come is an ill omen, for it means Gondor is hard pressed, and now calls upon their allies to aid them.\n\nWhat says the lord of the Rohirrim?"
 rohan.2000.a: "Muster the Rohirrim!"
 rohan.2000.b: "Send a full host of our finest riders to aid our ancient allies."
 rohan.2000.c: "I will send who I can spare – gather what riders can be found at Dunharrow."
 rohan.2000.d: "We are too hard-pressed to send any aid now. We will ride when we can."

 rohan.2001.t: "The Heirs of Númenor"
 rohan.2001.desc: "From the South has come a great army, clad in mail and plate shining silver in the sun. The Tree flies proud and true above their multitude, an image of the splendour of Men before the world was remade. Gondor, ancient and fair, has not abandoned Rohan in its hour of need, but has strode forth in all its splendour and might.\n\nThe peasantry gather along the roads to see the finely armoured soldiery of Gondor, whose like has not been seen in Rohan for a great many years. They have an immense baggage train with them, carrying supplies and munitions for the army and its great siegeworks. But more than munitions and provisions, this army carries not the Tree aloft as its banner, but hope in victory, a hope that shall see the Riddermark through this terrible war."
 rohan.2001.a: "The splendour of the Kings of Men, undimmed before the breaking of the world."

 rohan.2002.t: "The Northern Army"
 rohan.2002.desc: "From the South has come an impressive army, making good time up the road from Anórien. It is a full army of Gondor, equipped for fighting on the wide plains of Rohan as the Northern Army of the old days was. Shining hauberks and well forged spear glint in the shadows of trees, with archers in the centre of the column.\n\nGondor, while not able to fully aid us in this war, has sent a princely army to aid us, one more than worthy of our ancient alliance. With their help, this war should quickly turn in our favour."
 rohan.2002.a: "When this is over, I shall visit Minas Tirith and give the steward my thanks."

 rohan.2003.t: "Warfare in the Ithilien Style"
 rohan.2003.desc: "The Gondorians have replied to our requests for aid by sending a small force to aid us. They are well equipped and trained and are led by a captain of fine skill and intellect.\n\nAlready the Gondorians have begun to sketch out ways to take advantage of our terrain to wear down our enemies with minimal casualties, a skill they say has been honed from long years of defending Ithilien against much greater numbers. Hasty fortifications in the Gondorian style have begun to arise around their small camp, and their men are regularly mingling with our levies and officers."
 rohan.2003.a: "I would have liked more quantity, but what they sent was at least of fine quality."

 rohan.2004.t: "Silence from the White Tower"
 rohan.2004.desc: "No aid shall come from Gondor. Our envoys arrived to find a city tense and brooding, a shadow of fear hanging over it. The captains of Gondor, they say, empathized with our plight, and debated long and hard over how to respond to it.\n\nIn the end, much aggrieved, they were forced to conclude that they were already so thinly stretched, they could afford no aid to Rohan. However, they will not forget our plight, and once they are able, they say that they shall send us aid."
 rohan.2004.a: "So did Eärnil say to Arvedui. That aid came too late."
 
 ### HORSEMASTERs EVENTS ###
 horsemasters.4901.t: "Orc Patrols Spotted in the Riddermark."
 horsemasters.4901.desc: "My Company and I, whilst patrolling and keeping the peace in the King's Realm, come across Orcish tracks. A short investigation reveals they are close. I could run them down, earning glory for me and my men, or track them to their camp and report to the King."
 horsemasters.4901.a: "Call our swiftest riders forth, and have them see where these Orcs lie their heads."
 horsemasters.4901.a.tt: "Your scouts return with news, grim faced and informing you that many Orcs have gathered near the Mountains, and a proper force will be needed to displace them."
 horsemasters.4901.b: "Run the scum down, no mercy! Forth, Eorlingas!"
 horsemasters.4901.b.tt: "The Orcish scum stood no chance and were swiftly run down. Their corpses were piled high and set aflame as a warning to others that Rohan is not idle, and our spears are yet unshaken."
 
### King in Golden Hall event chain ###

 rohan.2100.t: "The [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] in the Golden Hall"
 rohan.2100.desc: "Biting wind greets me as the heavy doors of the Meduseld are opened before me. Flags bearing my insignia whip in the cool morning air, and my breath comes out in a white vapor. Dawn lights the rim of the [whitemountains|E] with a pure fire, casting long shadows of the peaks across the plains of Harrowdale.\n\nThe long silver line of the Snowbourn courses dimly through the steppe, at this early hour as yet untouched by the eye of the sun. A member of my council appears at my side and greets me. “My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], your people work diligently, but their hands would find new strength if they had sight of their [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip]. Would you deign to make an appearance for your people?”"
 rohan.2100.a: "“I will ride as far as the Entwash with the patrol.”"
 rohan.2100.b: "“I will attend to the stables.”"
 rohan.2100.c: "“I will observe the training of new recruits.”"
 rohan.2100.d: "“My time is better spent on statecraft.”"

Where now the horse and rider? Where is the horn that was blowing? Where is the helm and the hauberk, and the bright hair flowing? Where is the hand on the harpstring, and the red fire glowing? Where is the spring and the harvest and the tall corn growing? They have passed like rain on the mountain, like a wind in the meadow; The days have gone down in the West behind the hills into shadow.
