 # Cultural Description
 decision_lotr_warbands_desc_mirkwood_leofring: "Agents from Dol Guldur have contacted you. Dol Guldur demands tribute of horse. They will supply you with a warband, you will deliver to Dol Guldur horses stolen from Rohan."
 decision_lotr_warbands_desc_parth_celebrant_leofring: "Despite settling between and so close to the perilous forests of Dwimordene and Fangorn our people have endured. Your people's rituals and sacrifices of food and wine must be appeasing the elvish wights of the golden wood."
 decision_lotr_warbands_desc_dwarrowhall_leofring: "After a perilous migration to lands south of the [greymountains|E] our people found refuge in an abandoned mine outside of Moria. It provided shelter and warmth from the bitter winters of those years. Your people will survive."
 decision_lotr_warbands_desc_bandit_leofring: "Roving bands of Orcs drove your people out of the north. Scores of your people have taken the life of banditry, raiding the Rohirrim across the Anduin."
 decision_lotr_warbands_desc_eotheod: "The Éothéod must assemble the cavalry and make ready for war. Stride forth Horse Lords!"
 decision_lotr_warbands_desc_adornaen: "The Rohirrim stole your land eons ago, but your people have rebuilt their lives in Dunland. Yet there is a power at work here, inciting warriors to take revenge of that old wound."
 decision_lotr_warbands_desc_fisherfolk: "Your people are simple fisherfolk, but in defence of their homelands they are ferocious!"

 decision_lotr_warbands_desc_gondor_gwathuirim: "The kinfolk of the ancient house of Haleth inhabited the [whitemountains|E] and all the lands to the sea. Yet when Númenórean colonists arrived from beyond the great sea, your lives were shattered as they refused to recognise you as people just like them, as one of the houses of the Edain.\n\nRespecting not your sacred heritage as a forest people, the colonial outsiders devastated the ancient woods of Gondor and the Enedhwaith. And for refusing to fight in their wars against the Dark Lord they cursed you."
 decision_lotr_warbands_desc_haradrim: "The Haradrim people are numerous, diverse, thriving; they live in great cities alongside the Harnen river, also in bellicose tribes, dominating the endless sands, some reside in fortresses from which they raid all coasts. These settled and tribal men and women alike, mingle under the sun in the bazaars of Middle-earth."
 decision_lotr_warbands_desc_haradrim_suladan: "$decision_lotr_warbands_desc_haradrim$\n\nA king has risen up and conquered the realm of Haruzan, his sights set on a Haradrim high-empire."

 decision_lotr_warbands_desc_haradrim_desert: "$decision_lotr_warbands_desc_haradrim$\n\nYou are of those Haradrim who track the dune sea, always ready for war, patient for an open weakness."

The Umbarian Black Lords pledge an army and supplies if we declare war on Gondor, but is now truly the right time for war?"

Consulting my [ROOT.Char.Custom('MyPriestTitle')] [realm_priest.GetFirstName], I am told that this ill omen is a likely spy sent by Abrakhân. Our lands have been scouted, our armies already counted, and the Golden King desires our realm to add to his growing threat.\n\nOf old, all trade routes in Middle-earth went through Abrakhân, and it was a golden kingdom set by the fertile shores of an inland sea. Ever it was ruled by a vicious king, said to be immortal, though none had ever seen their face, concealed they are with a golden mask.\n\nNow a dark presence fills the dead realm of Abrakhân, and already, the ancient Norias are turning. Despite the empty sea, slaves work the plantations thanks to the vast drawn supply of fossil water beneath Abrakhân. Norias and plantations will feed his growing armies, the Golden King desires all Haradwaith to worship, as they did in an age past, the Dark Lord Zigûr, known as Sauron."

#  abrakhan.0010.desc: "Between the Dune Sea and the Inner Sea looms the most alien landscape in all the Haradwaith. Before a great sandstone mountain chain and deep within a sinkhole is the Ogladalo Vatra, the Mirror of Fire. The salt flats of the ancient, dried lake have no equal in Middle-earth, so broad and unvarying it is. It was once known in memory and in guiding dreams as Lake Uhtyaarâ, the seasonal waters that flow in from the mountains retain that name.\n\nDeep beneath the mountains and broken terrain are ancient fossil waters tapped through cracks in the surface by the people who dwell near the mirror. Extraction happened at an industrial scale, when once the kingdom of Abrakhân was wealthy with trade, grand norias gathered water from the lake and from underground. Without those norias, the Mirror of Fire would support no life at all.\n\nThe salt of the Ogladalo Vatra is deadly to all life, used as a poison in the courts of Abrakhân and a fitting execution is salt mummification. The impossible difficulty travelling from the markets of the Far East and Distant Lands to the cities west of Lake Uhtyaarâ in Abrakhân and Dârsalan has evaporated trade. And merchants are more likely to travel the long way around Abrakhân."
#  abrakhan.0010.a: "Lake Uhtyaarâ, the Mirror of Fire has no equal."
#  abrakhan.0010.b: "To be here when desert cities were lush with trade!"
#  abrakhan.0010.c: "Abrakhân is a dead kingdom on a dead lake."
#  abrakhan.0011.t: "The Covshek Pûst of Abrakhân"
#  abrakhan.0011.desc: "Abrakhân's native people are the Covshek Pûst. In distant, ancient times, these people dwelt on the rim of Lake Uhtyaarâ, before it was a dried Mirror of Fire, and there they made their camps and fared not often into the lush lakeside.\n\nFrom these times comes a dream of a boy who killed an ancient spirit-scorpion with the help of an old man. The man wanted to taste the scorpion meat, and he devoured the inner flesh of it in little time. The young boy wanted the adamantine chitin, a portion of which made his glittering armour as a new king of the lake men and mountain men, the rest he threw into the desert sands before the mountains, freeing Lake Uhtyaarâ from whatever evil presence dwelt there.\n\nMany Dune Sea tribes descended from the red-orange sedimentary mountains of the south and east, collectively they were known as the Covshek Pûst. Those who settled the ancient lake and source of the Nâfarat River were collected into a trade empire, as it was the hub of all Middle-earth trade at the time.\n\nThe Pûst are innovative, developing aquaponics to feed a great amount of people, floating gardens growing vegetables. And when water resources from the lake became exhausted, the Pûst resorted to pulling out of the ground the fossil waters of the underworld.\n\nAt some point in the past the splendour of Abrakhân beside Lake Uhtyaarâ has fallen, trade networks moved west towards Rây at the river’s delta, and the Nâfarati tribes, warlike invaders from the south with a mystic and blood seeking culture, have taken the fertile lands of the Nâfarat River, disconnecting Abrakhân to Rây. To enact revenge, Abrakhân has occasionally fielded Nâfarati shock knights and marauders armed with great maces against the Râyan people. These tribes are also well known to use the megafauna of the jungles of the south, bringing both beast and bird alongside their mercenary companies for the use of the rulers of Abrakhân."
#  abrakhan.0011.a: "The innovations of Abrakhân depend on our dreams."
#  abrakhan.0011.b: "We may depend too heavily on this fossil water."

It descends upon my settlements at [raided_county.GetName]\n\nA gruesome holdover from the armies of Morgoth in the Elder Days, he is a lesser fire demon. It is said that the Cûl Mahrist was placed under the Lake Uhtyaarâ, but since the lake’s evaporation, and the vast extraction of water from underground, the Sand Men have broken the seals to its deep caverns, and now this terror prowls the night under the open sky.\n\nThe Cûl Mahrist coverts our water supplies, and it is no doubt, after years of captivity, guarding the waters under the Ogladalo Vatra, it has burned into its mind a continuing desire to prevent people from reaching water sources. That much is clear in the demon’s purpose. We name it Destroyer and Unquenching."
