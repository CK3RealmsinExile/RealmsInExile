 ### DUNLAND KINGDOM EVENTS ###
 
 dunland.1001.t:0 "Coronation of a [restorer.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip]"
 dunland.1001.desc:0 ""In a grand procession, my greatest warriors and I ride from Isengeàrd across the Gap of [rohan|E], towards the old capital of the Forgoil kings. I ascend to their great hall, now adorned with a wall of spiked Forgoil heads and the banners of Dunland. \n\nDozens of Dunlending chieftains from clans all across my realm swear their loyalty to me, and as the elders crown me and proclaim me [restorer.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] of all [dunlendings|E]. I smile, knowing that our vengeance is finally complete.\n\nWhere Wulf and Freca failed, I have succeeded.\n\nThis is the beginning of a new age for my clan and the [dunlendings|E] as a whole. Already, large groups of Gwathuirim settlers have crossed the Isen and the Adorn and started pouring into the Westfold. All is not well, for there is still the looming threat of the Southmen beyond the White Mountains and the dark servants of the Red Eye, but today we shall celebrate our victory and our long sought revenge."
 dunland.1001.a:0 "A new era for our people."
 dunland.1001.tt:0 "Settlers from all across Dunland cross the Isen."
 dunland.1001.ttt:0 "The [dunlendings|E] will discover many innovations of Rohan."
 dunland.1001.tttt:0 "Isengard is consolidated into a middle-kingdom."
 
 dunland.1002.t:0 "The Dominion of the Hillmen" # unused
 dunland.1002.desc_same_culture:0 "The [dunlendings|E] are restored thanks to the efforts of [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationDescriptor', SCOPE.sC('restorer'))] [restorer.GetName]! Once more, the rich plains are under [restorer.GetCulture.GetName] rule."
 dunland.1002.desc:0 "The [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationDescriptor', SCOPE.sC('restorer'))] [restorer.GetName] and [restorer.GetHerHis] wildmen have carved out a new realm in Rohan and proclaimed it Kingdom of the Dunland reborn.\n\nIt remains to be seen if this attempt to restore [restorer.GetCulture.GetName] rule over Rohan will be more successful than the last..."
 
 dunland.1002.a:0 "A [restorer.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip] scourge upon the land."
 dunland.1002.b:0 "A victory for the [restorer.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip]!"
 dunland.1002.c:0 "Hmm, [restorer.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip] you say? Sign me up!"
 
 dunland.1003.t:0 "A Crown Seat Worthy of a [restorer.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip]"
 dunland.1003.desc:0 "As the festivities all across my new dominion slowly die down, I have started to convene with my chieftains. We have already formalised many laws, obligations and pacts. As the territories of Dunland and the former Riddermark merge together, the middle-lands have started to form into a new entity, centered around Isengeàrd.\n\nThe question of a new capital is now in my hands. It is clear that a legendary [restorer.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] should have a seat worthy of [restorer.GetHerHis] presence.\n\nThe great tower of [orthanc|E] would be an obvious choice due to its central location and strong fortifications, watching over all the lands of the [dunlendings|E].\n\nHowever, I could also choose to instead rule from Freca's Hall, ancient capital of Dunland, because of its historic significance as an ancestral meeting-place for our chieftains and seat of the kings of Old Dunland.\n\nMoreover, I could even make the former seat of the Forgoil kings into my own, to show them that their dominion has been forever broken and their ancestral halls are mine to wander."
 dunland.1003.a:0 "Isengeàrd shall become the center of my realm."
 dunland.1003.b:0 "Wulfborg has always been our home."
 dunland.1003.c:0 "Kingstead it shall be, let the Forgoil taste their defeat!"
 
 dunland.1004.t:0 "Enedhwaith integrated"
 dunland.1004.desc:0 "During a grand ceremony in the halls of Saralain, which has long been a meeting-place and seat of kings for the peoples of the region, all the lords of Western Enedhwaith have sworn their unending loyalty to you. The peoples of Saralain, the Gwathlo and the Isen now recognize you as their true and only ruler."
 dunland.1004.a:0 "Enedhwaith is ours."
 dunland.1004.tt:0 "The peoples of the Gwaithlo and the Isen recognize you as their ruler."

 dunland.1005.t:0 "Wild Child of Dunland"
 dunland.1005.desc:0 "You value little the comforts of what others call civilisation and prefer to trust your instincts when you must deal with others.\n\nThe wind rusts past, it is the call of the wild ways of your folk."
 dunland.1005.a:0 "I roam the forest without fear, reading sight and sound."
 dunland.1005.b:0 "Leader who is cautious, and vengeful."
 dunland.1005.c:0 "I am the secretive eye of Isengard."
 dunland.1005.d:0 "Fight, savage as the eastern mountains."
 dunland.1005.e:0 "Ancestors are among those who welcomed the Dwarves."
 dunland.1005.f:0 "Folk speak of spirits that haunt the fog; they talk of me."
 wild_forest_dweller_modifier:0 "Cultural Blessing: Forest Dweller"
 wild_forest_dweller_modifier_desc:0 "When you were young, your parents all but despaired of you, as you were always gone off into the hills, looking for things that were hidden. While the furthest slopes of the mountains are a frightening place when the darkness falls, you roamed there without fear, for you had learned how to read the song of every startled bird, each broken blade of grass and the crack of every old stone. The years have changed you little, though your friends swear that the wind itself must tell you secrets."
 wild_first_among_equals_modifier:0 "Cultural Blessing: First Among Equals"
 wild_first_among_equals_modifier_desc:0 "Your talents don’t just reside in your speech, but rather in accomplishing what you set out to do with your obstinate resolve. You have always been an example to all those around you and therein lies the problem.\n\nWhile some seek to emulate you, others have begun to declare you a dangerous influence, one that can only lead your folk into trouble against enemies they cannot hope to oppose."
 wild_eye_of_isengard_modifier:0 "Cultural Blessing: Eye of Isengard"
 wild_eye_of_isengard_modifier_desc:0 "Many years ago, when you were young and perhaps a bit foolish, you dared to pass unobserved into the circle of Isengard on a dare from a few of your fellows. But you could not long avoid the gaze of Saruman the White. Instead of being angry at your trespass, the Wizard was impressed by your courage, and he told you to return.\n\nOver the years, the White Wizard has passed on to you some of his wisdom, asking only that you tell him of your travels, and bring news that might be of interest to him. A generous bargain, for what you’ve gained."
 wild_mountain_savage_modifier:0 "Cultural Blessing: Mountain Savage"
 wild_mountain_savage_modifier_desc:0 "The majority of the folk of Dunland live by hunting, trading, animal husbandry and simple farming – but not yours. You come from the people of the eastern heights, raiders famed for their brutal attacks and ruthless tactics, even against other [dunlendings|E].\n\nAs you came of age, you realised there were other ways to live than those you were raised to and set out to lead a different sort of life. The fierce warrior that lives within you, though, is never far from the surface…"
 wild_dwarf_friend_modifier:0 "Cultural Blessing: Dwarf Friend"
 wild_dwarf_friend_modifier_desc:0 "Your family is one among those that welcomed the exiles from the Lonely Mountain when they first arrived to Dunland as beggars at their door. Your grandfather spied the bearded strangers as they secretly practised their stonecraft or worked at the anvil, learning all he could, and then he passed his stolen craft along. You grew up singing Dwarven songs and playing with wondrous toys and know much about the secrets of steel and stone."
 wild_mist_child_modifier:0 "Cultural Blessing: Mist Child"
 wild_mist_child_modifier_desc:0 "When other folk speak of the spirits that haunt the fogs of the mountains, sometimes they are actually talking about you. Long ago, one of the greatest hunters of your tribe saw your potential and decided to teach you all she knew. She showed you the secrets of moving nearly invisibly between trees, and silently over broken stone.\n\nNow, owl’s wings scarcely make less sound than you do, and you believe that the time has come to put your skills to the test outside of the fells you know."
