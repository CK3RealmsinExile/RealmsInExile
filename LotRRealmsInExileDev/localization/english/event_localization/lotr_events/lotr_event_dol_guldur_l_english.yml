 # Dominion of the Sorcerer decision
 dol_guldur.0100.t:0 "Dominion of the Sorcerer"
 dol_guldur.0100.desc:0 "Centuries have passed since I have seen with the true sight of living eyes. Yet as I look out from the utmost tower of [GetTitleByKey('c_amon_lanc').GetNameNoTier] I can discern all that goes on within my growing realm, and I am well pleased. Mountains, woods - all mine. All smoulder.\n\nA black pall covers the land, and all those under it who still live are now my thralls. No elf or man still has the strength to contest my power here. The Tower of the Sorcerer is now the chief cornerstone and bulwark of the Darkness in northern lands.\n\nCan any not now quail in terror at the name of [ROOT.Char.GetFirstName], most dreadful of the [ringwraith|E]? Can any now doubt that I am my master’s chief and most terrible servant?"

Caras Galadhon has fallen to my forces, and the hated elves flee before my victorious armies. \n\nWe shall pillage and despoil this place, until nothing remains but scarred earth and hewn tree-stumps. All traces of elven influence shall be stamped out beneath the boots of the new masters of the Golden Wood!"
 dol_guldur.0200.a:0 "Burn them all."
