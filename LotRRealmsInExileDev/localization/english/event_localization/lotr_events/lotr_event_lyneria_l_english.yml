 lyneria.0001.desc.start:0 "I rule a city of salt winds and bustling harbours, where the weight of a name is measured in coin, not crowns.\n\nThe Lynerian League is no kingdom; it is a pact of autonomy, ambition, and mutual defence. Each city keeps its own council, its own coins, its own grudges, but when the sails of foreign fleets rise on the horizon, we raise our banners together.\n\n"
 lyneria.0001.desc.lyneria:0 "From here, in Lyneria, I see the League in full... its riches, its rivalries, its restless spirit. The Great Port thrums with voices from across the seas, its docks lined with goods that bind half a world together. To lead here is to walk a knife’s edge, for power flows like water, always shifting, always watching for weakness.\n\n"
 lyneria.0001.desc.nymara:0 "Here in Nymara, the League’s writ is carved in stone and steel. We are the gate through which the wild winds of Sîrayn must pass, the last bastion on the frontier. Our walls are strong and proud, raised not by kings, but by citizens. Every watchtower that crowns our defences is a promise: we will not be bent, nor bought, nor broken.\n\n"
 lyneria.0001.desc.emelcyn:0 "Emelcyn stands on the edge of civilization, where overgrown roads bring ivory and spice from the deep jungles of the Ivory Peninsula. The Sapphire Spire watches over our harbour like a jewel set in stone, beautiful, but unyielding. Traders and envoys cross our gates by day; scouts and spies by night. We are the League’s eyes on the far frontier, and we watch with care.\n\n"
 lyneria.0001.desc.other:0 "Our city is not counted among the League’s great triumvirate... not yet at least. But we pull our weight. The markets ring with silver tongues, the shipyards sing with hammer and flame, and our banners fly without shame. Every coin we earn, every deal we strike, pushes us closer to greatness.\n\n"
 lyneria.0001.desc.end:0 "To rule here is to balance pride against profit, independence against unity. The League does not ask for loyalty. It demands value. And I intend to prove mine, in gold, stone, and will."
 lyneria.0001.a:0 "Let us thrive as one."
