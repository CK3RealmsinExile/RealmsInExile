 lyneria.0001.t:0 "The Lynerian League"
 lyneria.0001.desc.start:0 "I rule a city of salt winds and bustling harbours, where the weight of a name is measured in coin, not crowns.\n\nThe Lynerian League is no kingdom; it is a pact of autonomy, ambition, and mutual defence. Each city keeps its own council, its own coins, its own grudges, but when the sails of foreign fleets rise on the horizon, we raise our banners together.\n\n"
 lyneria.0001.desc.lyneria:0 "From here, in Lyneria, I see the League in full... its riches, its rivalries, its restless spirit. The Great Port thrums with voices from across the seas, its docks lined with goods that bind half a world together. To lead here is to walk a knife’s edge, for power flows like water, always shifting, always watching for weakness.\n\n"
 lyneria.0001.desc.nymara:0 "Here in Nymara, the League’s writ is carved in stone and steel. We are the gate through which the wild winds of Sîrayn must pass, the last bastion on the frontier. Our walls are strong and proud, raised not by kings, but by citizens. Every watchtower that crowns our defences is a promise: we will not be bent, nor bought, nor broken.\n\n"
 lyneria.0001.desc.emelcyn:0 "Emelcyn stands on the edge of civilization, where overgrown roads bring ivory and spice from the deep jungles of the Ivory Peninsula. The Sapphire Spire watches over our harbour like a jewel set in stone, beautiful, but unyielding. Traders and envoys cross our gates by day; scouts and spies by night. We are the League’s eyes on the far frontier, and we watch with care.\n\n"
 lyneria.0001.desc.other:0 "Our city is not counted among the League’s great triumvirate... not yet at least. But we pull our weight. The markets ring with silver tongues, the shipyards sing with hammer and flame, and our banners fly without shame. Every coin we earn, every deal we strike, pushes us closer to greatness.\n\n"
 lyneria.0001.desc.end:0 "To rule here is to balance pride against profit, independence against unity. The League does not ask for loyalty. It demands value. And I intend to prove mine, in gold, stone, and will."
 lyneria.0001.a:0 "Let us thrive as one."

 lyneria.0002.t:0 "The League Charter Signed"
 lyneria.0002.desc:0 "After many years, what has only been talked about in abstract or as a fanciful notion has finally become a reality. The leaders of the Lynerian League have sat in council, debated at length, and signed a Concordat. The League Charter is ratified.\n\nWhat was once a loose defensive and economic alliance has now been formalised into a single, cohesive realm. Merchant-princes and civic councils alike have sworn allegiance to [new_king_ruler.GetTitledFirstName], recognising [new_king_ruler.GetHerHis] leadership for the mutual betterment of all.\n\nOthers have pledged their loyalty. The charter lies before me. Do I place my name beside theirs, or chart my own course?
 lyneria.0002.a:0 "For trade, for peace, for unity... I join them."
 lyneria.0002.b:0 "This is not the League I knew. I shall stand alone."

 lyneria.0003.t:0 "The League Charter Signed"
 lyneria.0003.desc:0 "It began with letters, promises, private meetings over wine and incense. I reached out to city after city, weighing egos, balancing rivalries, forging a vision of unity.\n\nNow, at last, the leaders of the League have signed the Concordat. The old ties of necessity are now bonds of law. A chartered realm. One voice, one future, and at its helm: me.\n\nThe quills are dry. The seals set. The League is born anew."
 lyneria.0003.a:0 "Let no city fall behind."

 lyneria.1001.t:0 "The Seal of Tûl Harar"
 lyneria.1001.desc:0 "We have placed our seal on Tûl Harar, Sirayn’s glittering mouth to the sea. Here, the Sîresha River carries goods from deep inland: indigo, rare dyes, spices and silks, all flowing to foreign markets through a single city.\n\nNow that city bows to us. Our merchants are granted first rights on cargos and concessions, our harbourmasters walk the docks. In every bolt of cloth and urn of spice, the scent of our profit rises."
 lyneria.1001.a:0 "Their treasures are now ours to trade."

 lyneria.1002.t:0 "The Delta of Kings"
 lyneria.1002.desc:0 "My men stand at the harbours of Pyrador, the heart-port of Harshandatt, cradled by the branches of the Núar River. This city of papyrus archives and perfumed oils once served the ancient Nhazadhs of old. Now it swells the coffers of [ROOT.Char.GetPrimaryTitle.GetBaseNameNoTierNoTooltip].\n\nTheir artisans and masons share their secrets with our builders. Our architects sketch domes inspired by their skyline. Pyrador may lie far from our walls, but its stones now build our future."
 lyneria.1002.a:0 "Let every brick laid in my name remember this day."

 lyneria.1003.t:0 "Roots of Healing, Fruits of Power"
 lyneria.1003.desc:0 "Mejha’s markets overflow with the bounty of the Kjhana tree, from which medicinal sap, rich oils, firewood, fruit, and more are produced. Now that the great city opens its ports to [ROOT.Char.GetPrimaryTitle.GetBaseNameNoTierNoTooltip] dominance, the strength of its herbal lore becomes ours.\n\nOur healers speak in wonder of what they’ve seen. Our apothecaries already begin their work. This is more than trade; it is rejuvenation."
 lyneria.1003.a:0 "Even our breath feels lighter."

 lyneria.1004.t:0 "The Gateway to Khy"
 lyneria.1004.desc:0 "At Samarth, every trade route from the wide lands of Khy converges and spills out into the sea. Once Númenórean, always imperial, the city gleams with age and power. Their incense drifts like holy smoke; their glassware gleams like the eyes of gods.\n\nNow it is [ROOT.Char.GetPrimaryTitle.GetBaseNameNoTierNoTooltip] coin that weighs heavier than memory. We levy tariffs, recruit from the docks, and call their crowds to our colours."
 lyneria.1004.a:0 "Even old empires must bow to new gold."

 lyneria.1005.t:0 "Salt, Stone, and Sovereignty"
 lyneria.1005.desc:0 "Kantilya lies carved between sea and crag, a natural bulwark and a crucible of trade. From its stores come salt, pitch, and hardened resin, all vital to ships, roads, and war machines.\n\nWith our grip on its quay and storehouses, our fleets sail further and our merchants walk roads paved with Bulchyadean salt. The reach of [ROOT.Char.GetPrimaryTitle.GetBaseNameNoTierNoTooltip] is hardened."
 lyneria.1005.a:0 "We bind our power with salt and flame."

 lyneria.1006.t:0 "The Wine of Jorash"
 lyneria.1006.desc:0 "Jorash, where olive groves kiss the sea and vineyards cascade down sunlit terraces. Their oil is smooth as silk, their wine dark as memory. And now, their shipments pour into our cellars.\n\nTrade here is not just sustenance, but celebration, refinement, and influence. Every table in [ROOT.Char.GetPrimaryTitle.GetBaseNameNoTierNoTooltip] now echoes the feast of Jorash."
 lyneria.1006.a:0 "Let them drink to our fortune."

 lyneria.1007.t:0 "Timber and Tools from Kandalar"
 lyneria.1007.desc:0 "The hills of Kandalar are rich with trees and knowledge. Their carpenters build not just ships, but the tools with which ships are built. It is these treasures that now flow to us, bundled in crates stamped with the seal of [ROOT.Char.GetPrimaryTitle.GetBaseNameNoTierNoTooltip].\n\nDockyards in my realm echo with new rhythms, saws bite keener, and the scent of foreign pine lingers in the wind."
 lyneria.1007.a:0 "We shape our own destiny, and now, the tools to do it."

 lyneria.1008.t:0 "Jewels of Anarikê"
 lyneria.1008.desc:0 "Narikhar, jewel of the coast and gate to Anarikê’s riches, now swells with our colours. Its silver veins, its deep sapphires, the gleam of its mines, all now pass under our tariffs and taxes.\n\nThese are not baubles for vanity. This is wealth to impress courts, pay armies, and etch our name into the ledgers of the world."
 lyneria.1008.a:0 "We shine brighter than any gem."

 lyneria.1009.t:0 "The Anchorage of Inyalôni"
 lyneria.1009.desc:0 "Inyalôni is no idle port, it is Anarikê’s rising sun, a city where ambition and tropical splendour meet. With its hardwoods and sea pearls now bound to us, its trade is ours to channel.\n\nBut more than that, it is a bulwark. A foothold. A presence planted deep within Anarikê’s heart. My grip on the Bay has grown firmer."
 lyneria.1009.a:0 "A crown may lie inland, but it is won on the waves."

 lyneria.1010.t:0 "Command of Lyneria"
 lyneria.1010.desc:0 "The mercantile city of Lyneria is a marketplace of ideas, artistry, and unrelenting ambition. Its guilds are independent to a fault, its brokers speak every tongue, and its coin flows faster than armies can march.\n\nTo have claimed influence here is to lay hands on the levers of regional trade. Ivory from the jungles, masterworks from artisan workshops, and the restless energy of free minds all now pulse outward from Lyneria beneath the flag of [ROOT.Char.GetPrimaryTitle.GetBaseNameNoTierNoTooltip]."
 lyneria.1010.a:0 "Let the markets swell and the forges blaze."
