 rangers.0101.t: "The Dúnedain of [ROOT.Char.GetPrimaryTitle.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip]"
 rangers.0101.desc: "Ever since the fall of the kingdom of [GetTitleByKey('k_arthedain').GetNameNoTier], the [dunedainarnor|E] have dwelled in secrecy, keeping a watch over the former kingdom of [arnor|E]. To that end, they have maintained encampments around [eriador|E], from which to preempt any threats endeavoring to enter the depopulated region covertly.\n\nI now lead one of these encampments, with my rangers running to and fro on many an errand. All the Dúnedain swear allegiance to [dunedain_chieftain.GetTitledFirstName], yet on account of the sheer breadth of Eriador, [dunedain_chieftain.GetSheHe] rarely exerts much day to day governance on the encampments, leaving them to trusted lieutenants.\n\nYet we are still bound to [dunedain_chieftain.GetHerHim] and owe [dunedain_chieftain.GetHerHim] our fealty. Perhaps we should seek more direct guidance from [dunedain_chieftain.GetHerHim]?"
 rangers.0101.a: "[dunedain_chieftain.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] shall guide us."
 rangers.0101.b: "No need to bother the Chieftain. We can handle this." 
 
 rangers.0200.t: "The Passing of Gilraen"
 rangers.0200.desc: "On one of his trips in the North, Aragorn visited with his mother Gilraen in autumn. After spending a few days together, he prepared to leave out on his next journey, when his mother came to speak with him. \n\n"This is our last parting, Estel, my son. I am aged by care, even as one of lesser Men; and now that it draws near, I cannot face the darkness of our time that gathers upon Middle-earth. I shall leave it soon." \n\nAragorn tried to comfort her, saying: "Yet there may be a light beyond the darkness; and if so, I would have you see it and be glad." \n\nBut she answered only with this linnod: Ónen i-Estel Edain, ú-chebin estel anim; "I gave Hope to the Dúnedain, I have kept no hope for myself." \n\nHeavy in his heart, Aragorn went away to his tasks and toil. Gilraen died before the next spring."
 rangers.0200.a: "Mother... I miss you dearly, but I hope you are at peace with father now."

 ### Arassuil Events ###
 rangers.0300.t: "Growing Orc Activity"
 rangers.0300.desc: "In the recent months, the [orcs|E] of the [mistymountains] have increasingly become restless. On multiple occasions, they have left their underground dwellings and have undertaken raids into the lands that lie to both sides of the mountain range.\n\nWhile [rhovanion|E] is beyond our reach, the [dunedain|E] have sworn to protect [eriador|E], and I intend to keep that oath. We are the shield that guards these wild lands.\nMy scouts have uncovered the name of the strongest leader among the Orcs. It is [azog.GetFirstName], ruler of the dark halls of [moria|E], who seeks to unite all of his vile kind beneath his banner.\n\nWith my rangers already stretched thin across the vastness of the North, I have scarce resources to deal with this new threat. Luckily, we are not alone in this fight. I shall seek out the counsel of one of the [dunedain|E]'s closest allies - Elrond Halfelven of Rivendell."

 rangers.0301.t: "The Last Homely House"
 rangers.0301.desc: "My companions and I have followed the Great East Road through the rugged hills of [rhudaur|E], reaching the fords of the river Bruinen. Here, a hidden path begins that only few men have ever taken. Among the [dunedainarnor|E] it is well-known, for it leads to the Last Homely House at the edge of the wilderness, home of [elrond.GetFirstName] Halfelven. The sons of our chieftains have been raised here, in the hidden vale of Imladris, ensuring the survival of the line of [isildur|E] until their time has come.\n\nI make my way through the elven city and find myself face to face with its master in his vast library. "Well met, [ROOT.Char.GetFirstName], son of [ROOT.Char.GetFather.GetFirstName]!" Master Elrond greets me warmly. "What brings you to Imladris?"\n\nIn a few quick words relay the news of the emboldened [orcs|E] to him."
 rangers.0301.a: "I have come to seek your counsel on this matter."

 rangers.0302.t: "Troubling Reports"
 rangers.0302.desc: "My son, [son_of_elrond.GetFirstName] has returned from a journey to the [lothlorien|E], beyond the [mistymountains|E]. He speaks of a sharp rise in the number of [orcs|E] in the mountains and warns they may spill into [eriador|E] soon. Crossing the passes was a dangerous affair, even for ones such well-travelled as my hardy sons, which is a worrying fact by itself.\n\nThe Orcs have troubled us in the past, leading to the passage of my poor wife into the Undying Lands - a memory that still causes me much pain. If we do not act, tragedies such as these may occure once more.\n\nThe [dunedainarnor|E], long time allies of Imladris dwell nearby. They will be eager to aid our cause against the Orcs."
 rangers.0302.a: "I will contact the [dunedainarnor|E]."
 rangers.0302.a.tt: "You will send a message to the Rangers of the North"
 
 rangers.0303.t: "The Chieftain of the Dúnedain"
 rangers.0303.desc: "An honoured guest has come to my house. It is [dunedain_chieftain.GetName] answering my recent message concerning the rise of the [orcs|E] of the [mistymountains|E]. He brings more news of recent raids and the name of the orcish leader: Azog, ruler of the darkness of [moria|E]. The Dúnadan asks for my counsel on how to deal with this new menace.\n\nI ponder his questions for a moment before giving an answer. "Such a foe is not easily bested, my friend. If you get an opportunity to strike at him, your aim must be true!" After a short pause, I add:"
 rangers.0303.a: "You must lure the orcish leader out into the open."

The task is clear, but the choice how to achieve it is mine."

 rangers.0305.desc: "I return from [GetTitleByKey('c_imladris').GetNameNoTier] with renewed determination. [azog.GetFirstName] is a threat to the safety and peace of [eriador|E] that I am oath-bound to vanquish.\n\nThere are a few different paths that now lie before me. As Master Elrond suggested, I could attempt to lure out the beast and trap it on open ground, separated from aid and allies. I could also seek to venture forth into the darkness beneath the mountains and challenge the leader of the [orcs|E] directly.\n\nThe Dúnedain will never falter in their conviction to defend the North. And as their leader, neither will I."

 rangers.0306.t: "To Ambush an Orc"
 rangers.0306.desc: "Previous raids into [eriador|E] have shown that the [orcs|E] lead by [azog.GetName] are looking for easy targets that yield a large amount of loot. If we are to lay a trap for them, we must offer bait that is tempting enough to lure them out into the open.\n\nTo that end, I have ordered the preparation of a caravan bound for the Gladden Pass, carrying provisions and other valuable goods. My best trackers and I will shadow the caravan, ready to strike once the Orcs have spotted their bait and attempt to claim it..."
 rangers.0306.a: "I won't let [azog.GetFirstName] escape."

 rangers.0316.t: "Springing the Trap"
 rangers.0316.desc: "The time has come. We pass through the wilderness of [eregion|E], following the caravan I set as bait for the [orcs|E]. My scouts report that a raiding party coming from the [mistymountains|E] draws near, lead by [azog.GetName] himself.\n\nI ready my bow and arrows as the clamour of the raiders starts to rise. Quickly I give my rangers the signal. Spring the trap! The ambush has found its target, and now we must make sure our prey doesn't escape..."
 rangers.0316.a: "I have you right where I want you, [azog.GetFirstName]..."

 rangers.0326.desc: "Our arrows have flown true. Most of the [orcs|E] are dead before they even realize they've been ambushed. [azog.GetFirstName] is felled by a well-aimed javelin, piercing his neck from behind.\n\nWe pile up the orcish carcasses and set it ablaze before escorting the caravan back to safety. Messengers from Imladris arrive shortly afterwards, congratulating me on the success. Robbed of their ambitious leader, the Orcs will soon turn on each other once more, devolving into infighting and feuds. They shall not trouble [eriador|E] again for a long time. I will make sure of it!"
 rangers.0326.a: "I should employ this method more often."
 rangers.0326.a.tt: "You return to the Angle of Mitheithel"

 rangers.0336.t: "An Ambush Overturned"
 rangers.0336.desc: "To our shock and surprise, the [orcs|E] have beaten back our ambush! We do not know how, but for some reason, they knew we were waiting for them. Curse their night-seeing eyes!\n\nThe fight went badly and my Rangers were driven off. Many have been wounded and the caravan was lost. All we can do now is retreat back to the west, and make a new plan."

 rangers.0307.t: "A Brave Foray"
 rangers.0307.desc: "As I gather my companions around me I feel the weight of duty heavy on my shoulders. I've decided to go in secret to the western gate of [moria|E], bringing only a select few of my best fighters with me. My task lies before me as clear as the sun that pierces the clouds above us. We must enter the domain of [azog.GetName] and slay him.\n\nThis task will rely both on secrecy and strength of arms. I know that the orcish warlord is prideful and won't be able to reject my challenge once we hve entered Moria. As I touch the hilt of my trusted blade I am filled with determination and confidence. I will end this threat once and for all."
 rangers.0307.a: "My blade against his crude scimitar!"

 rangers.0317.desc: "Passing swiftly and silently through the empty plains of Eregion of old, my small party comes at last to the foothills of the [mistymountains|E], where lies the old dwarven road leading to the western gate of [moria|E]. Heavy rain has set in and we are soon drenched and freezing. As we begin to climb an old set of stairs, my caravan master, [caravan_master.GetFirstName], stops me. "We mustn't go near the lake up there," [caravan_master.GetSheHe] warns with a pale face. "There is a terror hidden beneath the waters, as the stories go. We should take a detour."\n\nWhile these stories are not unknown to me, I feel a certain urgency pushing me to brook no more delays. We must find our quarry and find it soon. Can we risk a long detour at this point?"

 rangers.0327.t: "The Challenge"
 rangers.0327.desc: "The Doors of Durin are opened once the elvish word "mellon" has been spoken. We enter into a dusty hall where the air is heavy and smells of decay. Soon after, we are discovered by a small patrol of [orcs|E] passing down the stairs at the opposite end of the chamber. We make quick work of them, slaying most of their number but intetionally leaving a few of them alive. "Bring this message to he who calls himself Lord of Moria," I demand, mustering all the authority I can. "Come out, [azog.GetFirstName], come out! I, [ROOT.Char.GetFirstName] of the Dúnedain have come to challenge you! Come out if you be not craven! Or else hide in shame forever!"\n\nMy challenge echoes across the forsaken hallways that lie beyond the entrance hall. We set the captured Orcs free and they bolt away. I know my words will reach their leader and ready myself for the fight that lies ahead..."
 rangers.0327.a: "Come forth, Azog! Come forth and face justice!"
 rangers.0327.a.tt: "The Orc will respond to your challenge"
 
 rangers.0337.t: "The Duel"
 rangers.0337.desc: "The Orc warlord has answered my challenge! Surrounded by a cadre of his strongest fighters, clad in dread-iron, he descends the stairs leading to the chamber inside the Door of Durin. Coming to a stop just a stone's throw across the hall from us, his gaze meets mine. I see no fear in the creature's eyes - only an insatiable lust for power and slaughter. I steel my nerves as I draw my sword and raise it to renew my challenge.\n\n"What's this now?" the orc snarls. "Another beggar at my door? Must I brand you as well?"\n\nI am taken aback by his threat but do not let it show. "You will face retribution for the sorrows you have brought upon the peoples of Eriador, here and now," I reply. [azog.GetFirstName] curses, and draws his orcish blade. "Indeed?" he bellows. "Come and fight, then! I'll remind you why I am the master!"\n\nI have but moments left to decide who will be the one to fell him."

The [orcs|E] howl in fear, recoiling before the might of the [dunedainarnor|E]. They flee back into the darkness they emerged from, terrified and ashamed.\n\nAs the rush of battle and the triumph of victory pass, I find myself weary, but relieved. It is done. Our foe is slain and his hold over [moria|E] broken. The surviving orcs and goblins will tremble in their hovels, falling back into feuds amongst themselves, of that I am sure.\n\nI wipe the dark blood off my blade and sheathe it slowly. It is time to leave this foreboding place and return to the light of day."

Protecting [eriador|E] takes its toll, leaving us with less able-bodied fighters than I would like to have for a war such as this. To march upon the Black Pit itself and oust its dark denizens is a task we cannot achieve by ourselves. We will need allies!\n\nMy thoughts turn to the [elves|E] of Imladris. They have been in league with us even before the fall of [arnor|E], aiding our ancestors in many of the wars that ravaged the north. I will return to Master Elrond and enlist his aid in this gambit. He might even know of others that could be convinced to take up arms against the orcish threat. And then, when all is ready, we shall march on [moria|E]."

The Master of Rivendell is open to my invitation, pledging the support of those [elves|E] that are willing to fight. "I offer another ally, my friend," the Half-elf adds. "This is [brogur.GetName] of the Iron Garrison, who seeks to enter Moria for his own reasons." The dwarf bows, greeting me with the words "At your service."\n\nNow these are some unexpected allies!
