 rangers.0101.desc:0 "Ever since the fall of the kingdom of [GetTitleByKey('k_arthedain').GetNameNoTier], the [dunedainarnor|E] have dwelled in secrecy, keeping a watch over the former kingdom of [arnor|E]. To that end, they have maintained encampments around [eriador|E], from which to preempt any threats endeavoring to enter the depopulated region covertly.\n\nI now lead one of these encampments, with my rangers running to and fro on many an errand. All the Dúnedain swear allegiance to [dunedain_chieftain.GetTitledFirstName], yet on account of the sheer breadth of Eriador, [dunedain_chieftain.GetSheHe] rarely exerts much day to day governance on the encampments, leaving them to trusted lieutenants.\n\nYet we are still bound to [dunedain_chieftain.GetHerHim] and owe [dunedain_chieftain.GetHerHim] our fealty. Perhaps we should seek more direct guidance from [dunedain_chieftain.GetHerHim]?"

After spending a few days together, he prepared to leave out on his next journey, when his mother came to speak with him. \n\n"This is our last parting, Estel, my son. I am aged by care, even as one of lesser Men; and now that it draws near, I cannot face the darkness of our time that gathers upon Middle-earth. I shall leave it soon." \n\nAragorn tried to comfort her, saying: "Yet there may be a light beyond the darkness; and if so, I would have you see it and be glad." \n\nBut she answered only with this linnod: Ónen i-Estel Edain, ú-chebin estel anim; "I gave Hope to the Dúnedain, I have kept no hope for myself." \n\nHeavy in his heart, Aragorn went away to his tasks and toil. Gilraen died before the next spring."

On multiple occasions, they have left their underground dwellings and have undertaken raids into the lands that lie to both sides of the mountain range.\n\nWhile [rhovanion|E] is beyond our reach, the [dunedain|E] have sworn to protect [eriador|E], and I intend to keep that oath. We are the shield that guards these wild lands.\nMy scouts have uncovered the name of the strongest leader among the Orcs. It is [azog.GetFirstName], ruler of the dark halls of [moria|E], who seeks to unite all of his vile kind beneath his banner.\n\nWith my rangers already stretched thin across the vastness of the North, I have scarce ressources to deal with this new threat. Luckily, we are not alone in this fight. I shall seek out the counsel of one of the [dunedain|E]'s closest allies - Elrond Halfelven of Rivendell."

The sons of our chieftains have been raised here, in the hidden vale of Imladris, ensuring the survival of the line of [isildur|E] until their time has come.\n\nI make my way through the elven city and find myself face to face with its master in his vast library.

He speaks of a sharp rise in the number of [orcs|E] in the mountains and warns they may spill into [eriador|E] soon. Crossing the passes was a dangerous affair, even for ones such well-travelled as my hardy sons, which is a worrying fact by itself.\n\nThe Orcs have troubled us in the past, leading to the passage of my poor wife into the Undying Lands - a memory that still causes me much pain. If we do not act, tragedies such as these may occure once more.\n\nThe [dunedainarnor|E], long time allies of Imladris dwell nearby. They will be eager to aid our cause against the Orcs."

The Dúnadan asks for my counsel on how to deal with this new menace.\n\nI ponder his questions for a moment before giving an answer. "Such a foe is not easily bested, my friend.
