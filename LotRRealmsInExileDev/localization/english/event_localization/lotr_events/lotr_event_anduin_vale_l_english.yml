 anduin_vale.0102.desc:0 "For time out of mind, the Woodmen and their brethren in the Vale have remained fiercely independent, both from outsiders and from each other. Only in the direst of need have the fractious tribes elected a single ruler, the All-Thane or 'Aledegan', to unite their efforts against a common enemy. \n\nBut times have changed. Under your dynasty a great realm has been forged, uniting both the Anduin Vale and the traditional lands of the Woodmen in the great forest of Greenwood. The disparate folk of Wood and Vale have all acknowledged your leadership, and the right of your heirs to rule in perpetuity. Never again will your people be divided, to fall prey to predatory orcs, wargs and worse. You have created the Realm of the All-Thane - the Aladegana!"
 anduin_vale.0102.a:0 "And I am the Aladegan!"
 anduin_vale.0102.a.tt:0 "You have created the empire title of Aladegana"

 anduin_vale.0106.desc:0 "For long years my people have been but a shadow of their former might, living hidden lives in the folds below the Grey Mountains. With the departures of Eorl and Leofr with the greater part of the Éothéod the dwindling remnant were too weak to assert their claim to the Vale, and pressure from Goblin raids and Woodmen usurpers long prevented any hope of a resurgence.\n\nYet under my leadership the Framlings have rallied, and once again the northern Vale is dominated by the true sons of Fram. Our valour has been proven at the point of a sword, and the Kingdom of the Éothéod is resurgent astride the roots of the Great River. \n\nAmong the bolder and more ambitious of my folk there are even rumblings that the renewed Northern Kingdom should assert itself over the sons of Eorl & Leofr to the south..."
 anduin_vale.0106.a:0 "The Realm of the Riders is restored!"
 anduin_vale.0106.a.tt:0 "You have consolidated your realm and recreated the Kingdom of the Éothéod"

 leofring_event_chain.0001.desc:0 "Some say a sorceress lives in the woods of [dwimordene|E], a fay that can control the mists of the Great River and lure good men to their doom. But we, the Aftercomers - true followers of the faith of the Fey Court - know otherwise. It is a benevolent messenger of [foldewyncharacter|E] - or it might even be the Lady of Plenty herself. \n\nWhether or not the Lady Foldewyn or just one of her handmaidens dwells in the Dwimordene, it is a sacred place nonetheless. \n\nMy [chaplain.GetCouncilTitle] has counseled me to seek out the Lady of Dwimordene, and implore her for guidance in these dark times..."

When they asked me to state my business, I replied with honesty, and was permitted to enter their city, built mostly high above the ground, in the golden trees. \n\nThe Lord and Lady of the Fey-kin greet me, and I now find myself struggling to find the right words. "Your search for wisdom has led you here, [ROOT.Char.GetFirstName] of [ROOT.Char.GetPrimaryTitle.GetNameNoTier]," the Lady says, her eyes captivating my humbled gaze.
