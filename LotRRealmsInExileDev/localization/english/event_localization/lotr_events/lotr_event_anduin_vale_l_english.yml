 anduin_vale.0102.desc:0 "For time out of mind, the Woodmen and their brethren in the Vale have remained fiercely independent, both from outsiders and from each other. Only in the direst of need have the fractious tribes elected a single ruler, the All-Thane or 'Aledegan', to unite their efforts against a common enemy. \n\nBut times have changed. Under your dynasty a great realm has been forged, uniting both the Anduin Vale and the traditional lands of the Woodmen in the great forest of Greenwood. The disparate folk of Wood and Vale have all acknowledged your leadership, and the right of your heirs to rule in perpetuity. Never again will your people be divided, to fall prey to predatory orcs, wargs and worse. You have created the Realm of the All-Thane - the Aladegana!"
 anduin_vale.0102.a:0 "And I am the Aladegan!"
 anduin_vale.0102.a.tt:0 "You have created the empire title of Aladegana"

 anduin_vale.0106.desc:0 "For long years my people have been but a shadow of their former might, living hidden lives in the folds below the Grey Mountains. With the departures of Eorl and Leofr with the greater part of the Éothéod the dwindling remnant were too weak to assert their claim to the Vale, and pressure from Goblin raids and Woodmen usurpers long prevented any hope of a resurgence.\n\nYet under my leadership the Framlings have rallied, and once again the northern Vale is dominated by the true sons of Fram. Our valour has been proven at the point of a sword, and the Kingdom of the Éothéod is resurgent astride the roots of the Great River. \n\nAmong the bolder and more ambitious of my folk there are even rumblings that the renewed Northern Kingdom should assert itself over the sons of Eorl & Leofr to the south..."
