 anduin_vale.0102.t: "The Realm of the All-Thane"
 anduin_vale.0102.desc: "For time out of mind, the Woodmen and their brethren in the [anduinvale|E] have remained fiercely independent, both from outsiders and from each other. Only in the direst of need have the fractious tribes elected a single ruler, the All-Thane or 'Aledegan', to unite their efforts against a common enemy. \n\nBut times have changed. Under your dynasty a great realm has been forged, uniting both the Anduin Vale and the traditional lands of the Woodmen in the great forest of Greenwood. The disparate folk of Wood and Vale have all acknowledged your leadership and the right of your heirs to rule in perpetuity. Never again will your people be divided, to fall prey to predatory orcs, wargs and worse. You have created the Realm of the All-Thane - the Aladegana!"
 anduin_vale.0102.a: "And I am the Aladegan!"
 anduin_vale.0102.a.tt: "You have created the empire title of Aladegana."

 anduin_vale.0106.t: "The Kingdom of the Éothéod Restored!"
 anduin_vale.0106.desc: "For long years my people have been but a shadow of their former might, living hidden lives in the folds below the [greymountains|E]. With the departures of Eorl and Leofr with the greater part of the Éothéod, the dwindling remnants were too weak to assert their claim to the [anduinvale|E], and pressure from [goblin|E] raids and Woodmen usurpers long prevented any hope of a resurgence.\n\nYet under my leadership the Framlings have rallied, and once again the northern Vale is dominated by the true sons of Fram. Our valour has been proven at the point of a sword, and the Kingdom of the Éothéod is resurgent astride the roots of the Great River. \n\nAmong the bolder and more ambitious of my folk, there are even rumblings that the renewed Northern Kingdom should assert itself over the sons of Eorl & Leofr to the south..."
 anduin_vale.0106.a: "The Realm of the Riders is restored!"
 anduin_vale.0106.a.tt: "You have consolidated your realm and recreated the Kingdom of the Éothéod."
 
 anduin_vale.0107.t: "The Integration of Twainmantle"
 anduin_vale.0107.desc: "The [greynmountains|E] rise as high as the sky, piercing the clouds. They are undeniably the domain of [dwarves|E], such as the hardy folk who dwell at [nordinbad|E]. But Twainmantle is a region of rolling hills, ideal for raising our prized, enduring steeds.\n\nLong have our forefathers dwelt here, at the northernmost expanse of the [anduinvale|E], and now the time has come to formally integrate these foothills into our realm. All who dwell there shall answer to the Riders who rule the Vale - for now, and forevermore."
 anduin_vale.0107.a: "Let Twainmantle take its rightful place."

 anduin_vale.0110.t: "The Confederation Collapses"
 anduin_vale.0110.desc: "At last that pathetic, wretched Confederation of Langwell has been rent asunder. The deaths of the greatest and most influential lords in their little coalition have led to them turning on each other like baying dogs and trading accusations and insults; and at last the strife among them was too much. Their oaths of fellowship and brotherhood have been forgotten and trampled.\n\nThe Northmen were always weak and craven, little more than rabid but toothless whelps. Yet by my will their demise has been hastened, and they cower in fear at the shadow of myself, at the shadow of the north, at the shadow of [angmar|E]. They shall soon be thralls, and no more."
 anduin_vale.0110.a: "The north is ripe for the plucking."

 anduin_vale.0111.t: "The Collapse of the Confederation"
 anduin_vale.0111.desc: "The strife and infighting among the lords of the Confederation of Langwell has at last reached a tipping point. The deaths of the most influential chiefs in the Confederation have led to great paranoia, and the trading of accusations and insults among once at least nominal allies has grown more venomous and savage than ever before.\n\nOaths have been forgotten, former friends turn on each other, and to all it is clear the coalition has collapsed. The threat of [angmar|E] looms still over the whole north, yet it seems we must alone survive the coming storm, and not place our hope in others."
 anduin_vale.0111.a: "What are we to do?"
