 ### Introduction Events
 dwarven.0100.t:0 "The King Beneath the Mountain"
 dwarven.0100.desc:0 "Dain II Ironfoot, King Under the Mountain and the Lord of the Iron Hills has ruled these golden halls for nigh sixty years, sixty years of peace and prosperity for all Dwarvendom following the Battle of the Five Armies, the defeat of Smaug the Terrible and the tragic deaths of Thorin Oakenshield and his sister-sons.\n\nWith Erebor mostly rebuilt from the ravages of the Dragon, the Dwarves look once more beyond their borders to restore the ancient friendships with the Men of Dale and the Elves of the Greenwood, ever keeping a watchful eye to the Northern Wastes, lest any Fire-drakes still living surprise them once more."
 dwarven.0100.a:0 "Through Dragon-fire and war, these halls endure all"
 
 dwarven.0200.t:0 "The Lord of Moria"
 dwarven.0200.desc:0 "Balin of the Company of Thorin Oakenshield has set out on a grand quest once more - to reclaim the ancient Dwarven capital of Khazad-Dûm from the Orcish stragglers that crawled out of their caverns once more after the fateful Battle of Azanulbizar.\n\nSetting forth from Erebor with a great company of Dwarves against the wishes of King Dain, Balin travelled South and then West along the Old Forest Road passing through danger and strife beneath the boughs of Mirkwood before finally emerging and facing a fierce fight to gain entry to Khazad-Dûm.\n\nThe Company may be diminished, but our valour and ambition are not!"

 dwarven.0300.t:0 "The Lord of Nordinbad"
 dwarven.0300.desc:0 "Ever since the days of Gorin's great-grandsire, dwarves have dwelled in Nordinbad. Though the hold was never rich in terms of gold and silver, of iron it has plenty and its beauty is worth more than any mountain of gold, carefully nurtured and enhanced by the faithful Dwarves.\n\nWhile many other dwarf-holds in the Grey Mountains were consumed in Dragon-fire, the lack of conventional wealth steered the devastation away from Nordinbad's peaceful halls, and the Lords therein offered shelter to many survivors, for a time."
 dwarven.0300.a:0 "The beauty of Azan-zâram shall endure"
 
 dwarven.0330.t:0 "The Axe That Walks" #Argân
 dwarven.0330.desc:0 "I must not rest! Ever since the day my father stepped down, I have never stopped. The Shadow is long and its tendrils reach far, yet I have ventured further. If I rest here, I will... I would be a mere lord answering to the sedentary [longbeards|E] that cower in their hills from the dark with their "Warrior King" Dain. I crossed [middleearth|E] when I was half the age he killed that wimpering pale welp of an orc\n\nI can feel it in my body [mahalcharacter|E] is calling me home. To rest. To build the world anew, yet now is not the time! [sauroncharacter|E] has yet to be slain and Thrár must wait until I have finished. I must set off! I need a new adventure. A new War Mansion!"
 dwarven.0330.a:0 "I need only choose a point on the map..."
 dwarven.0330.b:0 "For now, I shall stay under King Dain"
 dwarven.0330.c:0 "AI Only"
 host_of_the_axe:0 "Host of the Axe"

 dwarven.0340.t:0 "The Lord of Nogrod"
 dwarven.0340.desc:0 "Eldberk, a mere ten winters into his life, witnessed the departure of his father to the fierce War of Dwarves and Orcs. Alas, his father found his final rest in a distant realm, denied the solace of a proper burial. A lingering bitterness took root within Eldberk's heart, for his uncle, Uri VI, returned from that grim conflict, while his father did not.\n\nDriven by a thirst for both renown and retribution, Eldberk embarked upon a daring venture alongside a fellowship, determined to reclaim the once-grand Mansion of Nogrod. Yet, fate had woven a cruel tapestry, for the Halls now lay submerged beneath unruly waters.\n\nNevertheless, the flame of ambition burned undiminished in Eldberk's breast. To emerge triumphant from the depths of adversity would not only quench his vengeful yearning but also carve his name into the annals of Dwarven lore."
 dwarven.0340.a:0 "Nogrod shall rise once more!"
 ## Introduction ###

 dwarven.1000.t:0 "The Children of Mahal"
 dwarven.1000.desc:0 "I was born among the children of [mahalcharacter|E], adopted children of [eru|E], the steadfast [dwarves|E]. Our father shaped us in dark times, and as such we are hardier than [conceptracemen|E], and more resistant to illnesses and corruption.\n\nWe are long-lived and slow to bloom: we consider our youths to be no more than children until the age of their [majority|El] at 40, and that it is inappropriate to marry before the age of 70. Dwarves of both genders wear beards since birth, and a Dwarf without a beard is the object of much shame and mockery.\n\nKhuzdul, our sacred language devised by the Maker himself, is never spoken in front of non-Dwarves and reseerved for ancient lore and solemn gatherings. In every day life we adopt the language of our closest neigbours and business partners.\n\nThough we do not fear the sun like the [orcs|E], we are most comfortable beneath the ground, where we carve halls in the living rock. Many of our ancestral homes have been destroyed, and now is the time to reclaim them!"
 dwarven.1000.a:0 "Baruk Khazâd! Khazâd ai-mênu!"

 dwarven.9500.desc:0 "As I grow older, I begin to muse over my future. The major choice that now lies before is whether to seek a mate, or to focus first and foremost on my craft. It is not uncommon for a Dwarf to take no mate, and to focus instead on honing the act of my craft. Or perhaps the one I desire would not have me, or has chosen another! Regardless of the reason, there is no shame in either choice. Yet I must keep the legacy of my house and family in mind, so that it does not end with me..."
