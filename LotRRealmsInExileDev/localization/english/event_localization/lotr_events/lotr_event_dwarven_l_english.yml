 dwarven.0205.t: "Gazing into Kheled-zâram"
 dwarven.0205.desc.1: "After leaving the Great Gates, I and my companions make our way down the vale to the long, tranquil lake. Kheled-zâram, whence [durin|E] gazed into, stands silent and still. Long do we gaze into it, contemplating the fate of our colony and what our next move should be. Do I see a hint of the ancient stars, set in a mighty crown? A sign, or perhaps a figment of my tired mind?\n\nYet suddenly the tranquility is broken by a terrible noise. We rise from our gazing, and turning around, dread like ice fills our veins. Rushing up the vale from the southeast is a band of [orcs|E], bows and swords in their hands. I hastily bark orders to retreat within the Gates. Yet though [Dwarves|E] may be sprinters, we are quickly set upon! Though we raise our axes and our armor stops many an arrow, there are simply too many. In the chaos we are separated, and I know not who lives and who dies. May [mahalcharacter|E] show mercy on us all."
 dwarven.0205.desc.2: "I go alone, an aged [dwarf|E] stooped from stress and cares. If my beard was not already white, it would assuredly be now! Once it had all shown such promise.\n\nMaking my way down the vale, I come at last to Kheled-zâram, whence [durin|E] gazed into, silent and still.\n\nGazing into its clear and cold depths, my mind turns, desperate for a solution. Do I see a hint of the ancient stars, set in a mighty crown? A sign, or perhaps a figment of my tired mind?\n\nYet suddenly the tranquility is broken by a terrible noise. Rising, I behold from the southeast a band of [orcs|E], rushing up the vale! Bows and arrows are in their hands, and wargs among their ranks. Ice fills my veins as I make for the Great Gates. Yet though my armor takes many arrows, finally one finds a chink in it. I fall to my knees, but scant feet from the Gate, my loyal companions rushing forth to face the foe.\n\nI feel faint. May [mahalcharacter|E] have mercy on us all. Forgive the foolishness of a wayward son."
 dwarven.0205.a: "Dáin... you were right..."
 dwarven.0205.b: "Gah!"

 dwarven.0210.t: "The Battle of Mazarbul"
 dwarven.0210.desc: "Though I live, it is not without injury or cost. Many warriors and friends who trusted me lie slain, at the Gates and in the halls. Yet more ill news is to come. The [orc|E] band we defeated, says the scouts, was but the vanguard of a great host of [orcs|E]. \n\nWe had thought them defeated, but it seems they were merely biding their time. I am filled at once with dread, doubt and self-contrition at my folly! Yet I do not let it show, for who shall lead if not I? I am the Lord of [Moria|E], and if today shall be my dying one, then I shall die as one.\n\nWith grim faces, my loyal followers set to work, preparing for the worst."
 dwarven.0210.a: "Drums. Drums in the deep. They come."
 
 ## Introduction ###

 dwarven.1000.t: "The Children of Mahal"
 dwarven.1000.desc: "I was born among the children of [mahalcharacter|E], adopted children of [eru|E], the steadfast [dwarves|E]. Our father shaped us in dark times, and as such, we are hardier than [conceptracemen|E] and more resistant to illnesses and corruption.\n\nWe are long-lived and slow to bloom: we consider our youths to be no more than children until the age of their [majority|El] at 40, and that it is inappropriate to marry before the age of 70. Dwarves of both genders wear beards since birth, and a Dwarf without a beard is the object of much shame and mockery.\n\nKhuzdul, our sacred language devised by the Maker himself, is never spoken in front of non-Dwarves and reserved for ancient lore and solemn gatherings. In everyday life we adopt the language of our closest neighbours and business partners.\n\nThough we do not fear the sun like the [orcs|E], we are most comfortable beneath the ground, where we carve halls in the living rock. Many of our ancestral homes have been destroyed, and now is the time to reclaim them!"
 dwarven.1000.a: "Baruk Khazâd! Khazâd ai-mênu!"

 dwarven.9002.a: "I can show my face in public without shame once again."

 dwarven.9500.t: "The Course of My Life"
 dwarven.9500.desc: "As I grow older, I begin to muse over my future. The major choice that now lies before me is whether to seek a mate or to focus first and foremost on my craft. It is not uncommon for a [dwarf|E] to take no mate and to focus instead on honing the act of my craft. Or perhaps the one I desire would not have me, or has chosen another! Regardless of the reason, there is no shame in either choice. Yet I must keep the legacy of my house and family in mind, so that it does not end with me..."
 dwarven.9500.a: "I shall seek a mate."
 dwarven.9500.b: "My craft calls to me!"
 
 dwarven.9700.t: "The Lonely Mountain is Ours"
 dwarven.9700.desc.evil: "For too long the accursed Dwarves of the [lonelymountain|E] have sat fat and proud upon their piles of gold, hiding behind the gates of their great Mountain. They have steadfastly defended their homes, their axes sharp and their armour nigh impervious. No longer.\n\nNow the Lonely Mountain is laid bare, its gates rent and its halls red with Dwarven blood. The riches of the Dwarves: shining jewels, precious gems, intricately carved weapons, and gold beyond measure and sorrow; all are ours to take and plunder. Long have many thought this realm unconquerable, save by dragonfire, but I have laid it bare."
 dwarven.9700.desc.good: "The fall of Erebor shocked many, and it was a great tragedy, akin to the Desolation of Smaug. Yet, though the memory of that failure still remains in our hearts, the sorrow of the loss is replaced now by joy and hope. The Lonely Mountain is ours once more, the filth that occupied it utterly cleansed, and a Dwarf now sits upon the throne. Just as the accursed dragon was vanquished, so were these savage occupiers."
 dwarven.9700.a: "Huzzah!"

 dwarven.9701.t: "The Fall of Erebor"
 dwarven.9701.desc: "Erebor, jewel of my people, has fallen. In a deed that will be long remembered by Dwarfkind, the gates of the Lonely Mountain fell, and enemies poured into the shimmering halls of the Dwarves. Just as when Smaug the Golden burned Dale and Erebor, countless are again driven into exile, and they look back upon their homeland with sorrow and grief, seeking to one day return to it again. I cannot let that filth pollute Erebor for long.\n\nWe shall return one day, and we shall have our vengeance in blood. Just as Smaug fell, let us vanquish the rabble that defiles our home!"
 dwarven.9701.a: "Let them fear the return of Mahal's children!"

 dwarven.9804.t: "Usurpation of the Throne"
 dwarven.9804.desc: "Perhaps the right of my [king.Custom('GetQueenKing')], [king.Custom('GetQueenKing')] [king.GetFirstName] to rule has come to its end. Rather than allow an illegitimate ruler to maintain their place on the throne, perhaps I should place a new [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetQueenKing')] on the throne? As I think of it, why should I even consider placing someone else upon the throne, when I myself am a perfectly capable candidate?\n\nPerhaps it is time that I take control of my House, that I claim the throne of my people. How should I go about doing so though? Through the threat of sword or dagger? By being a convincing diplomat and family [ROOT.Char.GetWomanMan]? Will [king.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] accept my rule, or will they resist me?\n\nDo I truly have the right to demand this of [king.GetHerHim]?"
 dwarven.9804.a: "Send [king.GetHerHim] notice that [king.GetSheHe] no longer rules our people."
 dwarven.9804.b: "I cannot do this, it is treason."

 dwarven.9805.t: "A New [claimant.Custom('GetQueenKing')]!?"
 dwarven.9805.desc: "My kins[claimant.GetWomanMan] [claimant.GetFirstName] has sent an outrageous message to my halls! [claimant.GetFirstName] claims that my rule over our people is illegitimate, and that [claimant.GetSheHe] is the true ruler of our House.\n\n[claimant.GetSheHe] asks me to step aside, to set aside my crown and my throne to become [claimant.GetHerHis] lesser, or [claimant.GetSheHe] shall remove me! The throne is mine by right, but is it worthwhile to resist, when I know that to do so will cost the lives of so many of my people? What is the right thing for a [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetQueenKing')] to do, when faced with such treason?"
 dwarven.9805.a: "If this traitor wants war, then [claimant.GetSheHe] will have it!"
 dwarven.9805.b: "I will not be the cause of unecessary deaths, I yield."

 dwarven.9806.t: "It will be War!"
 dwarven.9806.desc: "I have received word, [king.GetFirstName] has refused my offer and will not peacefully yield the throne of our people to me. I want no bloodshed, but [king.GetSheHe] forces my hand, for [king.GetHerHis] rule must continue no longer. Our people now suffer, because of [king.GetHerHis] choice."
 dwarven.9806.a: "It did not have to come to this, my kin."

 dwarven.9807.t: "A New [claimant.Custom('GetQueenKing')]"
 dwarven.9807.desc: "I have received word, [king.GetFirstName] has heeded my offer and has chosen to peacefully yield the throne of our people to me. It heartens me that [king.GetSheHe] chose not to sacrifice the lives of our people to satiate [king.GetHerHis] own ego.\n\nMy rule has begun, and my line shall assume the throne after me. As the new [claimant.Custom('GetQueenKing')], I must now decide how I will lead my people into this new age. What will the future hold in store for my reign? Will I lead them into a bright future or a glorious age? Or shall I be a worse [claimant.Custom('GetQueenKing')] than any who came before me?"
 dwarven.9807.a: "A new age begins for my people!"

 dwarven.9808.t: "A Crown of Victory"
 dwarven.9808.desc: "After refusing my offer to yield the throne peacefully, [king.GetFirstName] failed to even defend [king.GetHerHis] claim though war, as [king.GetSheHe] has been defeated.\n\nMy rule has begun, and my line shall assume the throne after me. As the new [claimant.Custom('GetQueenKing')], I must now decide how I will lead my people into this new age. What will the future hold in store for my reign? Will I lead them into a bright and glorious future? Or shall I be a worse [claimant.Custom('GetQueenKing')] than any who came before me?"
 dwarven.9808.a: "A new age begins for my people!"

 dwarven.9809.t: "Humiliated in Defeat"
 dwarven.9809.desc: "My kins[claimant.GetWomanMan] [claimant.GetFirstName] has bested me.\n\nI only fought to protect what [mahalcharacter|E] had given me against that traitor, and yet, his favour has passed from my face. [claimant.GetFirstName] now rules as [claimant.Custom('GetQueenKing')], for better or for ill."
 dwarven.9809.a: "I can only hope they will not ruin what I have accomplished."

 dwarven.9810.t: "My Endeavour has Failed"
 dwarven.9810.desc: "[king.GetFirstName] still rules our people as [king.Custom('GetQueenKing')], I have been bested.\n\n[mahalcharacter|E] stll stands with [king.GetHerHim], it was my own folly that drove me to this point, that killed our people for my own selfish desires."
 dwarven.9810.a: "To desire another's throne is foolishness."

 dwarven.9900.t: "Venerate the Ancestors: Into the Archives"
 dwarven.9900.desc: "I follow [realm_priest.GetCouncilTitle] [realm_priest.GetFirstName] into the lower halls, where the air is dry and still. Shelves of ledgers and worn scrolls line the room, each holding fragments of long-kept memory.\n\nWithout a word, [realm_priest.GetSheHe] begins scanning the seals and markings, moving with the ease of someone who knows exactly where to look. Soon, [realm_priest.GetSheHe] finds what [realm_priest.GetSheHe]'s after and hands me a scroll.\n\nI take it and sit down. The script is aged and the edges brittle, but the words remain clear."
 dwarven.9900.a: "Let me read it without distraction."

 dwarven.9911.t: "Venerate the Ancestors: Narvi of Moria"
 dwarven.9911.desc: "The scroll I unroll tells the tale of [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'lineofnarvi' ).GetFirstName], a master craftsman who rose to prominence during the height of [khazaddum|E]'s glory. In an unexpected alliance with [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'linefinwe18' ).GetFirstName], the [elven|E]-lord of [eregion|E], Narvi was commissioned by [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'lineofdurinII' ).GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal] to craft the mighty [doorsofdurin|E], the grand entrance that guarded the West-gate of [GetTitleByKey('k_khazad_dum').GetNameNoTier].\n\nHis bond with the Elven artificer remains legendary, a symbol of cooperation between two proud peoples. Together, they created a masterpiece, not just of craftsmanship but of friendship that withstood time.\n\nYet now, as I read of his accomplishments, I wonder: what is left of his legacy in this Age?"
 dwarven.9911.a: "We shall rebuild the friendship Narvi once had with the Elves."
 dwarven.9911.b: "What tripe! I'll be dead before we ally ourselves with the Elves!"

 dwarven.9912.t: "Venerate the Ancestors: Azaghâl of Belegost"
 dwarven.9912.desc: "I unroll a timeworn scroll detailing the valorous deeds of [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'lineofdwalin5' ).GetFirstName], Lord of [belegost|E] and father of [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'lineofdwalin7' ).GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal]. Renowned among the [broadbeams|E], his leadership during the [firstage|E] left an indelible mark on [dwarven|E] history.\n\nIt tells how he forged an alliance with [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'linefinwe10' ).GetFirstName] of the [houseoffeanor|E], after the [elven|E] prince saved him from an [orc|E] ambush. In gratitude, Azaghâl gifted him the Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin, a masterpiece made by [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'lineoftelchar1' ).GetFirstName] of [nogrod|E].\n\nThe scroll ends with the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, the Battle of Unnumbered Tears, where Azaghâl and his warriors stood against the dread [dragon|E] Glaurung. Though struck down in the clash, Azaghâl, with his dying breath, drove a knife into Glaurung's belly, wounding him grievously and forcing the dragon and his brood to retreat to [angband|E]."
 dwarven.9912.a: "Azaghâl's valour shall inspire our own deeds."
 dwarven.9912.b: "As he forged bonds with Elves, so shall we."
 dwarven.9912.c: "Azaghâl stood tall in his time. I shall stand taller in mine."

 dwarven.9913.desc: "The scroll tells of [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'lineoftelchar1' ).GetFirstName], master smith of [nogrod|E] and pupil of [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'lineofgamilzirak' ).GetName] Zirak. Among his greatest works were Angrist, a knife that cut through metal as if it were wood, which [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'lineofbeor32' ).GetFirstName] used to cut a [silmaril|E] from [morgothcharacter|E]'s crown; [narsil|E], the legendary sword later wielded by [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'lineofelendil' ).GetFirstName] against [sauroncharacter|E] and the Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin, crafted for [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'lineofdwalin5' ).GetFirstName], Lord of [belegost|E].\n\nAzaghâl gifted the helm to [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'linefinwe10' ).GetFirstName] when the prince of the [houseoffeanor|E] saved him from an [orc|E] ambush, but the helm was deemed too heavy and large for an [elf|E]. Even [men|E] found the helm too massive, and only [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'lineofhador1' ).GetFirstName] and some of his descendants had the strength to wear it.\n\nHis works bore strength, history, and legend in equal measure. How shall I honour such a legacy of craft and might?"
 dwarven.9913.a: "Telchar was a legendary craftsman above all."
 dwarven.9913.b: "Telchar's legacy is one of great victories first and foremost."
 dwarven.9913.c: "Telchar understood that knowledge precedes mastery."

 dwarven.9918.t: "Venerate the Ancestors: Lóni, the Turncoat"
 dwarven.9918.desc: "The scroll tells the tale of [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'lineofdurin641' ).GetFirstName], second son of [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'lineofdurin62' ).GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal], born beneath a shadow long before he cast one of his own.\n\nWhen their father passed, it was his older brother, [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'lineofdurin64' ).GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal], who inherited the mansion of [khazaddum|E]. Yet [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'lineofdurin641' ).GetFirstName] believed the throne should have been his — by merit, if not by birth and his ambition would not allow for such scorn.\n\nHe acted swiftly, and failed just as fast. His attempted seizure of the throne turned kin into enemies. Exiled and disgraced along with fellow plotter [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'linestiling3' ).GetFirstName], he fled north, where he carved a hold of his own from long-abandoned delvings, brooding on vengeance.\n\nHis second bid for power would end no better, whether by blade or betrayal, none can say. Yet his name endures, spoken with both anger and awe. For even a traitor may carve his tale deep into the stone of dwarven memory."
 dwarven.9918.a: "Ambition turned to folly. Let his name be a warning."
 dwarven.9918.b: "His pride cost him everything, but his ambition was praiseworthy."
