 dwarven.0101.t: "One Life, One Partner"
 dwarven.0101.desc.intro: "My spouse, [dead_character.GetTitledFirstName], has passed, leaving behind a life we built together. The halls feel colder now, and yet life continues.\n\nAmong our people, marriage is rare and not taken lightly. Most [dwarves|E] go through life alone, but those who find a partner are bound for life. "
 dwarven.0101.desc.no.dwarven.remarriage: "Such a bond is not merely of love, but of honour and permanence — a Dwarf marries only once, and no tradition permits a second union, even after death.\n\nThough grief may weigh heavily, I must now walk alone. To seek another would be to go against the ways of our people, and I know well that no Dwarf has ever done so and remained in honour."
 dwarven.0101.desc.dwarven.remarriage.allowed: "Such bonds are not easily set aside — even in death. Tradition holds that a Dwarf should not remarry, and those who do are often viewed with quiet disapproval.\n\nStill, no law forbids it. I must decide whether to honour tradition and remain alone, or seek another companion, knowing it will not be without judgement."
 dwarven.0101.a: "None shall take the place of [dead_character.GetTitledFirstName], in life or in memory."
 dwarven.0101.b: "May Mahal forgive me, but I long for warmth once more."

 dwarven_racial.1001.t: "A Good Trim"
 dwarven_racial.1001.desc: "I close the door to my chambers and set the lock. This sort of thing demands focus and must not be disturbed. A few moments of preparation follow, ensuring the candles will burn long and steady, adjusting the mirror and carefully positioning the stool. Soon, I am ready to begin.\n\nThe ritual starts with a careful assessment of my beard's current state. It could certainly be worse, all things considered. A little uneven, with a few stray hairs here and there, but nothing beyond repair. I set to work with great care and discipline.\n\nEach meticulous stroke of the blade is punctuated by a fresh application of warm water, softening the hair and ensuring precision. The process takes time, but such tasks are never meant to be rushed. Gradually, symmetry returns and the unruly strands fall into line.\n\nAt last, I sit back and study my reflection. All in all, much better. The beard now has a refined shape, its dignity enhanced. I cut a far finer figure, and the process was relaxing, to boot."
 dwarven_racial.1001.a: "I should do this more often."

 dwarven_racial.1002.t: "A Fantastic Trim"
 dwarven_racial.1002.desc: "I secure the lock on my door and ready my chambers for the task ahead. I choose the most comfortable cushion for my shaving stool, adjust the mirror so the lamplight does not glare into my eyes, and light a scented candle for good measure.\n\nThe figure in the mirror has looked better, and I take note of the sorry state of my beard. Loose hairs aplenty and uneven patches throughout. I set to work and soon settle into a steady rhythm, alternating between strokes of the razor and applying soothing water and rock salt to my face. Soon, I lose myself in the routine, and the burdens of the day lift from my shoulders.\n\nSome time passes, but eventually I set down my razor to examine my handiwork. It is majestic. My beard now hangs proud, groomed to perfection. I look years younger, yet no less wise for it. I feel energised, ready to face any trial."
 dwarven_racial.1002.a: "I look... regal."

 dwarven_racial.1003.t: "A Good Trim?"
 dwarven_racial.1003.desc: "As I close the door to my bedchamber, a familiar sense of comfort settles over me. I settle down on the stool beside the mirror and cast my eyes on the figure staring back. My eyes are drawn towards the impressive beard on my chin. Some excessive hairs are poking out of my nose, however, and it seems to be a bit longer on the left side, towards the ear...\n\nI gingerly pick up my razor and begin trimming - a few tufts here, a few strays there, just a little more... now to take care of that bit there... a few hairs too many, but I'll just even it out...\n\nMy thoughts trail off and my eyes widen. I can't fix what I've just done. I've cut too close to the skin, and now a whole clump of hair comes away in my hand. I look at the mirror and almost shriek in horror.\n\nThe only way to fix the disaster I've inflicted upon myself would be to shave it #italic all#! off."
 dwarven_racial.1003.a: "I can't do that! I could never do that!"

 ### Balin events ###
 dwarven.0205.t: "Gazing into Kheled-zâram"
 dwarven.0205.desc.1: "After leaving the Great Gates, I and my companions make our way down the vale to the long, tranquil lake. [Glossary('Kheled-zâram','kheled_zaram_gloss')], whence [durin|E] gazed into, stands silent and still. Long do we gaze into it, contemplating the fate of our colony and what our next move should be. Do I see a hint of the ancient stars, set in a mighty crown? A sign, or perhaps a figment of my tired mind?\n\nYet suddenly the tranquility is broken by a terrible noise. We rise from our gazing, and turning around, dread like ice fills our veins. Rushing up the vale from the southeast is a band of [orcs|E], bows and swords in their hands. I hastily bark orders to retreat within the Gates. Yet though [Dwarves|E] may be sprinters, we are quickly set upon! Though we raise our axes and our armor stops many an arrow, there are simply too many. In the chaos we are separated, and I know not who lives and who dies. May [mahalcharacter|E] show mercy on us all."
 dwarven.0205.desc.2: "I go alone, an aged [dwarf|E] stooped from stress and cares. If my beard was not already white, it would assuredly be now! Once it had all shown such promise.\n\nMaking my way down the vale, I come at last to Kheled-zâram, whence [durin|E] gazed into, silent and still.\n\nGazing into its clear and cold depths, my mind turns, desperate for a solution. Do I see a hint of the ancient stars, set in a mighty crown? A sign, or perhaps a figment of my tired mind?\n\nYet suddenly the tranquility is broken by a terrible noise. Rising, I behold from the southeast a band of [orcs|E], rushing up the vale! Bows and arrows are in their hands, and wargs among their ranks. Ice fills my veins as I make for the Great Gates. Yet though my armor takes many arrows, finally one finds a chink in it. I fall to my knees, but scant feet from the Gate, my loyal companions rushing forth to face the foe.\n\nI feel faint. May [mahalcharacter|E] have mercy on us all. Forgive the foolishness of a wayward son."
 dwarven.0205.a: "Dáin... you were right..."
 dwarven.0205.b: "Gah!"

 dwarven.0210.t: "The Battle of Mazarbul"
 dwarven.0210.desc: "Though I live, it is not without injury or cost. Many warriors and friends who trusted me lie slain, at the Gates and in the halls. Yet more ill news is to come. The [orc|E] band we defeated, says the scouts, was but the vanguard of a great host of [orcs|E]. \n\nWe had thought them defeated, but it seems they were merely biding their time. I am filled at once with dread, doubt and self-contrition at my folly! Yet I do not let it show, for who shall lead if not I? I am the Lord of [Moria|E], and if today shall be my dying one, then I shall die as one.\n\nWith grim faces, my loyal followers set to work, preparing for the worst."
 dwarven.0210.a: "Drums. Drums in the deep. They come."

 ## Introduction ###
 dwarven.1000.t: "The Children of Mahal"
 dwarven.1000.desc: "I was born among the children of [mahalcharacter|E], adopted children of [eru|E], the steadfast [dwarves|E]. Our father shaped us in dark times, and as such, we are hardier than [conceptracemen|E] and more resistant to illnesses and corruption.\n\nWe are long-lived and slow to bloom: we consider our youths to be no more than children until the age of their [majority|El] at 40, and that it is inappropriate to marry before the age of 70. Few among us wed, and those who do, only once. Dwarves of both genders wear beards since birth, and a Dwarf without a beard is the object of much shame and mockery.\n\n[khuzdul|E], our sacred language devised by the [Concept('mahalcharacter', 'Maker')|E] himself, is never spoken in front of non-Dwarves and reserved for ancient lore and solemn gatherings. In everyday life we adopt the language of our closest neighbours and business partners.\n\nThough we do not fear the sun like the [orcs|E], we are most comfortable beneath the ground, where we carve halls in the living rock. Many of our ancestral homes have been destroyed, and now is the time to reclaim them!"

Below us, throngs of eager [dwarves|E] crowd the lower caverns, with the cheers of even more echoing from balconies above. Construction is nearly complete.\n\nIt is to be Uzfelak, the jewel of [GetTitleByKey('k_nurunkizdin').GetNameNoTier]. A great tower, inverted, hung from the roof of the mountain, where once dwelt foul [goblins|E]. At its nadir, a crystal lamp, from which light will shine to fill these long-darkened halls.\n\nJointly, the Guildmasters present me with a ceremonial chisel, subtly engraved with gold filigree. 'It would be our honor, liege, if you would shape the final stone'. With one last stroke, my mark is carved, and the lamp ignited. Light, beautiful in a thousand ways, washes across every rock face.\n\nFar below, a pitiful cry."

 dwarven.9500.t: "The Course of My Life"
 dwarven.9500.desc: "As I grow older, I begin to muse over my future. The major choice that now lies before me is whether to seek a mate or to focus first and foremost on my craft. It is not uncommon for a [dwarf|E] to take no mate and to focus instead on honing the act of my craft. Or perhaps the one I desire would not have me, or has chosen another! Regardless of the reason, there is no shame in either choice. Yet I must keep the legacy of my house and family in mind, so that it does not end with me..."

 dwarven.9700.desc.evil: "For too long the accursed Dwarves of the [lonelymountain|E] have sat fat and proud upon their piles of gold, hiding behind the gates of their great Mountain. They have steadfastly defended their homes, their axes sharp and their armour nigh impervious. No longer.\n\nNow the Lonely Mountain is laid bare, its gates rent and its halls red with Dwarven blood. The riches of the Dwarves: shining jewels, precious gems, intricately carved weapons, and gold beyond measure and sorrow; all are ours to take and plunder. Long have many thought this realm unconquerable, save by [dragon|E]-fire, but I have laid it bare."
 dwarven.9700.desc.good: "The fall of Erebor shocked many, and it was a great tragedy, akin to the Desolation of Smaug. Yet, though the memory of that failure still remains in our hearts, the sorrow of the loss is replaced now by joy and hope. \n\nThe Lonely Mountain is ours once more, the filth that occupied it utterly cleansed, and a Dwarf now sits upon the throne. Just as the accursed dragon was vanquished, so were these savage occupiers."
 dwarven.9700.a: "Huzzah!"

 dwarven.9701.t: "The Fall of Erebor"
 dwarven.9701.desc: "Erebor, jewel of my people, has fallen. In a deed that will be long remembered by Dwarfkind, the gates of the Lonely Mountain fell, and enemies poured into the shimmering halls of the Dwarves. Just as when Smaug the Golden burned Dale and Erebor, countless are again driven into exile, and they look back upon their homeland with sorrow and grief, seeking to one day return to it again. I cannot let that filth pollute Erebor for long.\n\nWe shall return one day, and we shall have our vengeance in blood. Just as Smaug fell, let us vanquish the rabble that defiles our home!"
 dwarven.9701.a: "Let them fear the return of Mahal's children!"

 dwarven.9805.t: "Usurpation of the Throne"
 dwarven.9805.desc: "Perhaps the right of my [king.Custom('GetQueenKing')], [king.Custom('GetQueenKing')] [king.GetFirstName] to rule has come to its end. Rather than allow an illegitimate ruler to maintain their place on the throne, perhaps I should place a new [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetQueenKing')] on the throne? As I think of it, why should I even consider placing someone else upon the throne, when I myself am a perfectly capable candidate?\n\nPerhaps it is time that I take control of my House, that I claim the throne of my people. How should I go about doing so though? Through the threat of sword or dagger? By being a convincing diplomat and family [ROOT.Char.GetWomanMan]? Will [king.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] accept my rule, or will they resist me?\n\nDo I truly have the right to demand this of [king.GetHerHim]?"
 dwarven.9805.a: "Send [king.GetHerHim] notice that [king.GetSheHe] no longer rules our people."
 dwarven.9805.b: "I cannot do this, it is treason."

 dwarven.9806.t: "A New [claimant.Custom('GetQueenKing')]!?"
 dwarven.9806.desc: "My kins[claimant.GetWomanMan] [claimant.GetFirstName] has sent an outrageous message to my halls! [claimant.GetFirstName] claims that my rule over our people is illegitimate, and that [claimant.GetSheHe] is the true ruler of our House.\n\n[claimant.GetSheHe] asks me to step aside, to set aside my crown and my throne to become [claimant.GetHerHis] lesser, or [claimant.GetSheHe] shall remove me! The throne is mine by right, but is it worthwhile to resist, when I know that to do so will cost the lives of so many of my people? What is the right thing for a [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetQueenKing')] to do, when faced with such treason?"
 dwarven.9806.a: "If this traitor wants war, then [claimant.GetSheHe] will have it!"
 dwarven.9806.b: "I will not be the cause of unecessary deaths, I yield."

 dwarven.9807.t: "It will be War!"
 dwarven.9807.desc: "I have received word, [king.GetFirstName] has refused my offer and will not peacefully yield the throne of our people to me. I want no bloodshed, but [king.GetSheHe] forces my hand, for [king.GetHerHis] rule must continue no longer. Our people now suffer, because of [king.GetHerHis] choice."
 dwarven.9807.a: "It did not have to come to this, my kin."

 dwarven.9808.t: "A New [claimant.Custom('GetQueenKing')]"
 dwarven.9808.desc: "I have received word, [king.GetFirstName] has heeded my offer and has chosen to peacefully yield the throne of our people to me. It heartens me that [king.GetSheHe] chose not to sacrifice the lives of our people to satiate [king.GetHerHis] own ego.\n\nMy rule has begun, and my line shall assume the throne after me. As the new [claimant.Custom('GetQueenKing')], I must now decide how I will lead my people into this new age. What will the future hold in store for my reign? Will I lead them into a bright future or a glorious age? Or shall I be a worse [claimant.Custom('GetQueenKing')] than any who came before me?"
 dwarven.9808.a: "A new age begins for my people!"

 dwarven.9809.t: "A Crown of Victory"
 dwarven.9809.desc: "After refusing my offer to yield the throne peacefully, [king.GetFirstName] failed to even defend [king.GetHerHis] claim though war, as [king.GetSheHe] has been defeated.\n\nMy rule has begun, and my line shall assume the throne after me. As the new [claimant.Custom('GetQueenKing')], I must now decide how I will lead my people into this new age. What will the future hold in store for my reign? Will I lead them into a bright and glorious future? Or shall I be a worse [claimant.Custom('GetQueenKing')] than any who came before me?"
 dwarven.9809.a: "A new age begins for my people!"

 dwarven.9810.t: "Humiliated in Defeat"
 dwarven.9810.desc: "My kins[claimant.GetWomanMan] [claimant.GetFirstName] has bested me.\n\nI only fought to protect what [mahalcharacter|E] had given me against that traitor, and yet, his favour has passed from my face. [claimant.GetFirstName] now rules as [claimant.Custom('GetQueenKing')], for better or for ill."
 dwarven.9810.a: "I can only hope they will not ruin what I have accomplished."

 dwarven.9811.t: "My Endeavour has Failed"
 dwarven.9811.desc: "[king.GetFirstName] still rules our people as [king.Custom('GetQueenKing')], I have been bested.\n\n[mahalcharacter|E] stll stands with [king.GetHerHim], it was my own folly that drove me to this point, that killed our people for my own selfish desires."
 dwarven.9811.a: "To desire another's throne is foolishness."
