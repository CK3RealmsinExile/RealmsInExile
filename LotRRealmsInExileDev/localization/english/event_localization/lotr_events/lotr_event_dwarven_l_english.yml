 dwarven.0101.t: "One Life, One Partner"
 dwarven.0101.desc.intro: "My spouse, [dead_character.GetTitledFirstName], has passed, leaving behind a life we built together. The halls feel colder now, and yet life continues.\n\nAmong our people, marriage is rare and not taken lightly. Most [dwarves|E] go through life alone, but those who find a partner are bound for life. "
 dwarven.0101.desc.no.dwarven.remarriage: "Such a bond is not merely of love, but of honour and permanence — a Dwarf marries only once, and no tradition permits a second union, even after death.\n\nThough grief may weigh heavily, I must now walk alone. To seek another would be to go against the ways of our people, and I know well that no Dwarf has ever done so and remained in honour."
 dwarven.0101.desc.dwarven.remarriage.allowed: "Such bonds are not easily set aside — even in death. Tradition holds that a Dwarf should not remarry, and those who do are often viewed with quiet disapproval.\n\nStill, no law forbids it. I must decide whether to honour tradition and remain alone, or seek another companion, knowing it will not be without judgement."
 dwarven.0101.a: "None shall take the place of [dead_character.GetTitledFirstName], in life or in memory."
 dwarven.0101.b: "May Mahal forgive me, but I long for warmth once more."

 dwarven_racial.1001.t: "A Good Trim"
 dwarven_racial.1001.desc: "I close the door to my chambers and set the lock. This sort of thing demands focus and must not be disturbed. A few moments of preparation follow, ensuring the candles will burn long and steady, adjusting the mirror and carefully positioning the stool. Soon, I am ready to begin.\n\nThe ritual starts with a careful assessment of my beard's current state. It could certainly be worse, all things considered. A little uneven, with a few stray hairs here and there, but nothing beyond repair. I set to work with great care and discipline.\n\nEach meticulous stroke of the blade is punctuated by a fresh application of warm water, softening the hair and ensuring precision. The process takes time, but such tasks are never meant to be rushed. Gradually, symmetry returns and the unruly strands fall into line.\n\nAt last, I sit back and study my reflection. All in all, much better. The beard now has a refined shape, its dignity enhanced. I cut a far finer figure, and the process was relaxing, to boot." 
 dwarven_racial.1001.a: "I should do this more often."

 dwarven_racial.1002.t: "A Fantastic Trim"
 dwarven_racial.1002.desc: "I secure the lock on my door and ready my chambers for the task ahead. I choose the most comfortable cushion for my shaving stool, adjust the mirror so the lamplight does not glare into my eyes, and light a scented candle for good measure.\n\nThe figure in the mirror has looked better, and I take note of the sorry state of my beard. Loose hairs aplenty and uneven patches throughout. I set to work and soon settle into a steady rhythm, alternating between strokes of the razor and applying soothing water and rock salt to my face. Soon, I lose myself in the routine, and the burdens of the day lift from my shoulders.\n\nSome time passes, but eventually I set down my razor to examine my handiwork. It is majestic. My beard now hangs proud, groomed to perfection. I look years younger, yet no less wise for it. I feel energised, ready to face any trial."
 dwarven_racial.1002.a: "I look... regal."

 dwarven_racial.1003.t: "A Good Trim?"
 dwarven_racial.1003.desc: "As I close the door to my bedchamber, a familiar sense of comfort settles over me. I settle down on the stool beside the mirror and cast my eyes on the figure staring back. My eyes are drawn towards the impressive beard on my chin. Some excessive hairs are poking out of my nose, however, and it seems to be a bit longer on the left side, towards the ear...\n\nI gingerly pick up my razor and begin trimming - a few tufts here, a few strays there, just a little more... now to take care of that bit there... a few hairs too many, but I'll just even it out...\n\nMy thoughts trail off and my eyes widen. I can't fix what I've just done. I've cut too close to the skin, and now a whole clump of hair comes away in my hand. I look at the mirror and almost shriek in horror.\n\nThe only way to fix the disaster I've inflicted upon myself would be to shave it #italic all#! off."
 dwarven_racial.1003.a: "I can't do that! I could never do that!"

 ### Balin events ###
 dwarven.0205.t: "Gazing into Kheled-zâram"
 dwarven.0205.desc.1: "After leaving the Great Gates, I and my companions make our way down the vale to the long, tranquil lake. Kheled-zâram, whence [durin|E] gazed into, stands silent and still. Long do we gaze into it, contemplating the fate of our colony and what our next move should be. Do I see a hint of the ancient stars, set in a mighty crown? A sign, or perhaps a figment of my tired mind?\n\nYet suddenly the tranquility is broken by a terrible noise. We rise from our gazing, and turning around, dread like ice fills our veins. Rushing up the vale from the southeast is a band of [orcs|E], bows and swords in their hands. I hastily bark orders to retreat within the Gates. Yet though [Dwarves|E] may be sprinters, we are quickly set upon! Though we raise our axes and our armor stops many an arrow, there are simply too many. In the chaos we are separated, and I know not who lives and who dies. May [mahalcharacter|E] show mercy on us all."
 dwarven.0205.desc.2: "I go alone, an aged [dwarf|E] stooped from stress and cares. If my beard was not already white, it would assuredly be now! Once it had all shown such promise.\n\nMaking my way down the vale, I come at last to Kheled-zâram, whence [durin|E] gazed into, silent and still.\n\nGazing into its clear and cold depths, my mind turns, desperate for a solution. Do I see a hint of the ancient stars, set in a mighty crown? A sign, or perhaps a figment of my tired mind?\n\nYet suddenly the tranquility is broken by a terrible noise. Rising, I behold from the southeast a band of [orcs|E], rushing up the vale! Bows and arrows are in their hands, and wargs among their ranks. Ice fills my veins as I make for the Great Gates. Yet though my armor takes many arrows, finally one finds a chink in it. I fall to my knees, but scant feet from the Gate, my loyal companions rushing forth to face the foe.\n\nI feel faint. May [mahalcharacter|E] have mercy on us all. Forgive the foolishness of a wayward son."
 dwarven.0205.a: "Dáin... you were right..."
 dwarven.0205.b: "Gah!"

 dwarven.0210.t: "The Battle of Mazarbul"
 dwarven.0210.desc: "Though I live, it is not without injury or cost. Many warriors and friends who trusted me lie slain, at the Gates and in the halls. Yet more ill news is to come. The [orc|E] band we defeated, says the scouts, was but the vanguard of a great host of [orcs|E]. \n\nWe had thought them defeated, but it seems they were merely biding their time. I am filled at once with dread, doubt and self-contrition at my folly! Yet I do not let it show, for who shall lead if not I? I am the Lord of [Moria|E], and if today shall be my dying one, then I shall die as one.\n\nWith grim faces, my loyal followers set to work, preparing for the worst."
 dwarven.0210.a: "Drums. Drums in the deep. They come."
 
 ## Introduction ###
 dwarven.1000.t: "The Children of Mahal"
 dwarven.1000.desc: "I was born among the children of [mahalcharacter|E], adopted children of [eru|E], the steadfast [dwarves|E]. Our father shaped us in dark times, and as such, we are hardier than [conceptracemen|E] and more resistant to illnesses and corruption.\n\nWe are long-lived and slow to bloom: we consider our youths to be no more than children until the age of their [majority|El] at 40, and that it is inappropriate to marry before the age of 70. Few among us wed, and those who do, only once. Dwarves of both genders wear beards since birth, and a Dwarf without a beard is the object of much shame and mockery.\n\n[khuzdul|E], our sacred language devised by the [Concept('mahalcharacter', 'Maker')|E] himself, is never spoken in front of non-Dwarves and reserved for ancient lore and solemn gatherings. In everyday life we adopt the language of our closest neighbours and business partners.\n\nThough we do not fear the sun like the [orcs|E], we are most comfortable beneath the ground, where we carve halls in the living rock. Many of our ancestral homes have been destroyed, and now is the time to reclaim them!"
 dwarven.1000.a: "Baruk Khazâd! Khazâd ai-mênu!"

Below us, throngs of eager [dwarves|E] crowd the lower caverns, with the cheers of even more echoing from balconies above. Construction is nearly complete.\n\nIt is to be Uzfelak, the jewel of [GetTitleByKey('k_nurunkizdin').GetNameNoTier]. A great tower, inverted, hung from the roof of the mountain, where once dwelt foul [goblins|E]. At its nadir, a crystal lamp, from which light will shine to fill these long-darkened halls.\n\nJointly, the Guildmasters present me with a ceremonial chisel, subtly engraved with gold filigree. 'It would be our honor, liege, if you would shape the final stone'. With one last stroke, my mark is carved, and the lamp ignited. Light, beautiful in a thousand ways, washes across every rock face.\n\nFar below, a pitiful cry."

 dwarven.9500.desc: "As I grow older, I begin to muse over my future. The major choice that now lies before me is whether to seek a mate or to focus first and foremost on my craft. It is not uncommon for a [dwarf|E] to take no mate and to focus instead on honing the act of my craft. Or perhaps the one I desire would not have me, or has chosen another! Regardless of the reason, there is no shame in either choice. Yet I must keep the legacy of my house and family in mind, so that it does not end with me..."

 dwarven.9700.desc.evil: "For too long the accursed Dwarves of the [lonelymountain|E] have sat fat and proud upon their piles of gold, hiding behind the gates of their great Mountain. They have steadfastly defended their homes, their axes sharp and their armour nigh impervious. No longer.\n\nNow the Lonely Mountain is laid bare, its gates rent and its halls red with Dwarven blood. The riches of the Dwarves: shining jewels, precious gems, intricately carved weapons, and gold beyond measure and sorrow; all are ours to take and plunder. Long have many thought this realm unconquerable, save by [dragon|E]-fire, but I have laid it bare."
 dwarven.9700.desc.good: "The fall of Erebor shocked many, and it was a great tragedy, akin to the Desolation of Smaug. Yet, though the memory of that failure still remains in our hearts, the sorrow of the loss is replaced now by joy and hope. The Lonely Mountain is ours once more, the filth that occupied it utterly cleansed, and a Dwarf now sits upon the throne. Just as the accursed dragon was vanquished, so were these savage occupiers."
 dwarven.9700.a: "Huzzah!"

 dwarven.9701.t: "The Fall of Erebor"
 dwarven.9701.desc: "Erebor, jewel of my people, has fallen. In a deed that will be long remembered by Dwarfkind, the gates of the Lonely Mountain fell, and enemies poured into the shimmering halls of the Dwarves. Just as when Smaug the Golden burned Dale and Erebor, countless are again driven into exile, and they look back upon their homeland with sorrow and grief, seeking to one day return to it again. I cannot let that filth pollute Erebor for long.\n\nWe shall return one day, and we shall have our vengeance in blood. Just as Smaug fell, let us vanquish the rabble that defiles our home!"
 dwarven.9701.a: "Let them fear the return of Mahal's children!"

 dwarven.9804.t: "Usurpation of the Throne"
 dwarven.9804.desc: "Perhaps the right of my [king.Custom('GetQueenKing')], [king.Custom('GetQueenKing')] [king.GetFirstName] to rule has come to its end. Rather than allow an illegitimate ruler to maintain their place on the throne, perhaps I should place a new [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetQueenKing')] on the throne? As I think of it, why should I even consider placing someone else upon the throne, when I myself am a perfectly capable candidate?\n\nPerhaps it is time that I take control of my House, that I claim the throne of my people. How should I go about doing so though? Through the threat of sword or dagger? By being a convincing diplomat and family [ROOT.Char.GetWomanMan]? Will [king.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] accept my rule, or will they resist me?\n\nDo I truly have the right to demand this of [king.GetHerHim]?"
 dwarven.9804.a: "Send [king.GetHerHim] notice that [king.GetSheHe] no longer rules our people."
 dwarven.9804.b: "I cannot do this, it is treason."

 dwarven.9805.t: "A New [claimant.Custom('GetQueenKing')]!?"
 dwarven.9805.desc: "My kins[claimant.GetWomanMan] [claimant.GetFirstName] has sent an outrageous message to my halls! [claimant.GetFirstName] claims that my rule over our people is illegitimate, and that [claimant.GetSheHe] is the true ruler of our House.\n\n[claimant.GetSheHe] asks me to step aside, to set aside my crown and my throne to become [claimant.GetHerHis] lesser, or [claimant.GetSheHe] shall remove me! The throne is mine by right, but is it worthwhile to resist, when I know that to do so will cost the lives of so many of my people? What is the right thing for a [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetQueenKing')] to do, when faced with such treason?"
 dwarven.9805.a: "If this traitor wants war, then [claimant.GetSheHe] will have it!"
 dwarven.9805.b: "I will not be the cause of unecessary deaths, I yield."

 dwarven.9806.t: "It will be War!"
 dwarven.9806.desc: "I have received word, [king.GetFirstName] has refused my offer and will not peacefully yield the throne of our people to me. I want no bloodshed, but [king.GetSheHe] forces my hand, for [king.GetHerHis] rule must continue no longer. Our people now suffer, because of [king.GetHerHis] choice."
 dwarven.9806.a: "It did not have to come to this, my kin."

 dwarven.9807.desc: "I have received word, [king.GetFirstName] has heeded my offer and has chosen to peacefully yield the throne of our people to me. It heartens me that [king.GetSheHe] chose not to sacrifice the lives of our people to satiate [king.GetHerHis] own ego.\n\nMy rule has begun, and my line shall assume the throne after me. As the new [claimant.Custom('GetQueenKing')], I must now decide how I will lead my people into this new age. What will the future hold in store for my reign? Will I lead them into a bright future or a glorious age? Or shall I be a worse [claimant.Custom('GetQueenKing')] than any who came before me?"
 dwarven.9807.a: "A new age begins for my people!"

 dwarven.9808.t: "A Crown of Victory"
 dwarven.9808.desc: "After refusing my offer to yield the throne peacefully, [king.GetFirstName] failed to even defend [king.GetHerHis] claim though war, as [king.GetSheHe] has been defeated.\n\nMy rule has begun, and my line shall assume the throne after me. As the new [claimant.Custom('GetQueenKing')], I must now decide how I will lead my people into this new age. What will the future hold in store for my reign? Will I lead them into a bright and glorious future? Or shall I be a worse [claimant.Custom('GetQueenKing')] than any who came before me?"
 dwarven.9808.a: "A new age begins for my people!"

 dwarven.9809.t: "Humiliated in Defeat"
 dwarven.9809.desc: "My kins[claimant.GetWomanMan] [claimant.GetFirstName] has bested me.\n\nI only fought to protect what [mahalcharacter|E] had given me against that traitor, and yet, his favour has passed from my face. [claimant.GetFirstName] now rules as [claimant.Custom('GetQueenKing')], for better or for ill."
 dwarven.9809.a: "I can only hope they will not ruin what I have accomplished."

 dwarven.9810.desc: "[king.GetFirstName] still rules our people as [king.Custom('GetQueenKing')], I have been bested.\n\n[mahalcharacter|E] stll stands with [king.GetHerHim], it was my own folly that drove me to this point, that killed our people for my own selfish desires."
 dwarven.9810.a: "To desire another's throne is foolishness."

 dwarven.9900.desc: "I follow [realm_priest.GetCouncilTitle] [realm_priest.GetFirstName] into the lower halls, where the air is dry and still. Shelves of ledgers and worn scrolls line the room, each holding fragments of long-kept memory.\n\nWithout a word, [realm_priest.GetSheHe] begins scanning the seals and markings, moving with the ease of someone who knows exactly where to look. Soon, [realm_priest.GetSheHe] finds what [realm_priest.GetSheHe]'s after and hands me a scroll.\n\nI take it and sit down. The script is aged and the edges brittle, but the words remain clear."

[GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'lineofuriI' ).GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal] was the founder of proud [nogrod|E] (Kh.

It was his reign that saw the Firebeards lent their craft to [finrod|E], whom they named [Glossary('Felagund','felagund_gloss')], aiding in the construction of the stronghold of [GetTitleByKey('k_nargothrond').GetNameNoTier], where the ancient [dwarven|E] halls of Nulukkizdîn once stood.\n\nIn this rare collaboration, a famed piece of jewellery was made for [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'linefinwe33' ).GetFirstName], the [nauglamir|E], the Necklace of the Dwarves, which the Elves came to know as [Glossary('Sigil Elu-naeth','sigil_elu_naeth_gloss')]."

 dwarven.9932.desc: "The scroll recounts the deeds of [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'lineofuriII' ).GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal] of the [firebeards|E], born amidst pride and division. His father had refused [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'lineofdurin2' ).GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal]'s offer of sanctuary for the Firebeards in [khazaddum|E], perceiving it, though likely unintended, as a slight upon the honour and capability of the Firebeards. Half of [urisfolk|E] disagreed with Thrur and traveled east to [GetTitleByKey('k_khazad_dum').GetNameNoTier]. Among them was Thrur's brother [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('secondlineofuri1').GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal] who founded a cadet branch of Úri's line.\n\nThough proud, he recognised [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'lineofdwalinII' ).GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal]'s wisdom, for like the [broadbeams|E], the halls they clung to could no longer sustain them.

As the second ruler of Buzrâ-dûm, he sought not to reunite all [dwarves|E], but his own people. With careful words, he reopened ties with estranged Firebeards. His reign marked a quiet return to kinship, the first steps toward full reconciliation."
 dwarven.9932.a: "Sometimes, a people must stand alone to preserve their identity."

This caution remained when Úri III later took up the Ring's legacy.\n\nUnlike [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofuriII').GetFirstNameRegnal], who pursued diplomacy with other [dwarf|E]-holds, Úri III governed inwards, cautious of outside influence.

 dwarven.9933.a: "No doubt this gift was fiercely protected."

 dwarven.9934.desc: "This scroll speaks of [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofuriIV').GetFirstNameRegnal], a [dwarf|E] already long in years when the [Concept('warlastalliance', 'Last Alliance')|E] was forged. Unlike his kin among the [durinsfolk|E], Úri did not march to war. For centuries, the [firebeards|E] had remained apart, rooted in pride and the memory of old betrayals. Yet during his reign, a gentle thaw began between the Dwarven houses, perhaps seeded in his youth by tales of [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofdwalin45').GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal] and his generous rule, whose final years overlapped with Úri's own early days. The Firebeards were heartened by the courage of [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofdurinIV').GetFirstNameRegnal] of the [longbeards|E] and some even sought to aid in the war against [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofsauron').GetFirstName]. Úri did not forbid those of [urisfolk|E] who wished to fight beside [men|E] and [elves|E], such as his cousin [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofuri45c').GetFirstNameRegnal], nor did he rebuke the smiths who forged weapons for the [arnorians|E].\n\nÚri IV would live to see the fall of [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('linefinwe41').GetFirstName], [elendil|E], and [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineoforopher1').GetFirstName], and the severing of the [masterring|E]. Úri's rule marked not the forging of new alliances but the easing of ancient enmities, the first cracks in walls long held firm.

He lived in a time when the [dwarven|E] clans stood divided by suspicion and pride, but his reign proved uncommonly measured and conciliatory, a striking contrast to the defiant temper of his earlier incarnations.\n\nSince the [warofwrath|E] in the [firstage|E], when [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'lineofuri5' ).GetFirstNameRegnal] of [GetTitleByKey('k_buzra_dum').GetNameNoTier] turned the Firebeards inward and away from the other houses, aloof isolation had taken root among [urisfolk|E]. The pain of lost [nogrod|E] and pride wounded by exile hardened into mistrust that lingered through the Ages.\n\n[GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofuriV').GetFirstNameRegnal], however, saw in kinship the path to renewal. Through diplomacy and quiet perseverance, he reopened ancient pathways of trust and fellowship between the Firebeards, the [longbeards|E], and the [broadbeams|E]. His reign marked the mending of ties once thought broken beyond repair.

Úri's twin brother, [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofuri116').GetFirstName], was killed in that conflict, a loss that would haunt the family.\n\nFollowing the sack of [erebor|E], Úri granted land and material support to the exiles of [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofdurin83').GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal], settling them near his own hold. Though Thorin would later undertake the Quest for Erebor, some [longbeards|E] remained settled in [GetTitleByKey('c_thorins_hall').GetNameNoTier] even after his departure. In later years, Úri deepened ties with the [broadbeams|E] and with [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofcirdan').GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal] of [lindon|E]. From these exchanges, the teachings of [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofuriVI').GetFaith.GetAdjective] spread amongst his folk. Though some resisted, Úri stood by both the faith and his outreach to the [elves|E].\n\nAfter the war, the northern reaches of [nogrod|E] were resettled by his nephew [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofuri122').GetFirstNameNicknamed]. Though he resented Úri for surviving when his own father had perished, the two settled their rivalry just before Úri's death following the War of the Ring's end.

Once among his kin, Khathzâ did not stay silent for long.\n\nHe spoke often and with conviction, claiming the Dwarves had been betrayed, that Thingol had broken faith first and scorned their kind. His words, bitter and unwavering, stirred anger among the [firebeards|E]. When his liege [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofuri3').GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal] heard his account, he gathered a host and marched upon Menegroth, loosing vengeance upon Doriath. In the days after the [warofwrath|E], with Nogrod destroyed, the Firebeards split. Khathzâ journeyed south with [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofuri5').GetFirstNameRegnal], and those who followed his teachings became known as the [Glossary('Mazalikân','mazalikan_gloss')]. Others, led by Thrur's brother [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('secondlineofuri1').GetFirstNameRegnal], chose instead to uphold the old ways and settled in [khazaddum|E].\n\nKhathzâ's legacy remains: a deep suspicion of [elves|E] and outsiders, a belief in self-reliance, and a proud, if fractured, Firebeard identity."
 dwarven.9937.a: "His steadfastness led many to question old ties and seek a new path."

His reign was marked by cautious diplomacy, fostering renewed kinship with the fractured clan still wary from past wounds.\n\nYet despite his legacy as a skilled conciliator, most [dwarves|E] instead remember him as 'Trollbane', for he once slew three [trolls|E] singlehandedly while defending his entourage in [GetTitleByKey('d_high_pass').GetNameNoTier] of the [mistymountains|E], returning from a mission to the [ironhills|E]."

These secrets, fiercely guarded, became the root of their fortune. Soon, the eastern clans came bearing gold for Ironfist work — and Sindri let them pay.\n\nHis halls grew rich with the bounty of four clans. It is said the floors gleamed with riches, and his court dined on fruits and meats brought by the Hisildi [elves|E] from distant forests.

Grandson of King [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofsindri29').GetFirstNameRegnal], who first received the [Concept('sevenringsofdwarves', 'Ring of the Ironfists')|E], Sindri III inherited a realm united by trade and craft, yet stood at the edge of an age grown darker. The will of [sauroncharacter|E] stirred again in the East, and the plains of [rhun|E] began to fall under its weight.\n\nAs the shadow spread, Sindri was the first Ironfist monarch to extend a cautious hand toward the long-separated [dwarven|E] clans of the [redmountains|E], seeking some renewal of ancient kinship with varying degrees of success, as old distrust still lingered and full alliance remained far off.\n\nIn these uncertain days, many among the Ironfist Diaspora, those scattered among the realms of [men|E], sought livelihood through war. Sindri, wary but pragmatic, revised the customs of his forebears to permit such service on the strict condition that no oaths were sworn, no allegiance pledged, and no alliances made. Thus the principle of neutrality, once born of trade, was extended into mercenary toil.

Sindri's courage was admirable, but he ultimately fell to the Dragon's flames. The Ironfists avenged him, and slew the beast, but the damage it upon Kheled-Nâla inflicted was lasting.

The failed claim of the Nargubraz royal line ultimately led to [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofbavor42').GetFirstNameRegnal] of the [stonefoots|E] becoming the new ruler. Deemed accursed by [bavorsfolk|E], Dumsuhersar was spurned and so passed to $Thr_ar$'s southern kin in [GetTitleByKey('k_mablad_dum').GetNameNoTier], then ruled by [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('thirdlineofthrar31').GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal]."
 dwarven.9974.a: "I too shall face great peril if duty demands it."
 dwarven.9974.b: "A shame to see such works of craftsmanship lost to time."

 dwarven.9975.t: "Venerate the Ancestors: Thrár V, the Rebuilder"
 dwarven.9975.desc: "The scroll describes [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofthrarV').GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal], who rose from the ashes of a broken realm. Born to the southern line in [GetTitleByKey('k_mablad_dum').GetNameNoTier], his youth was marked by fire and ruin. In the days of his father [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('thirdlineofthrar57').GetFirstNameRegnal]'s rule, the earth heaved, and the perceived wrath of [mahalcharacter|E] consumed the [dwarven|E] dwellings. When the mountains quieted, two-thirds of the southern [blacklocks|E] lay dead, and [orcs|E] from the deep emerged to seize what remained.\n\nFrom these ashes, $Thr_ar$ emerged not as a conqueror, but as a renewer. He rallied the survivors, and relocated the royal seat to [GetTitleByKey('k_barazimab_ul').GetNameNoTier], in the [yellowmountains|E]. There, he spent his time rebuilding halls, rekindling hope and reforging shattered pride. Under his guidance, the remaining Blacklocks chose to seclude themselves, trading ambition for endurance.\n\nThough he seldom looked beyond the [yellowmountains|E], his was a kingship that preserved a people on the brink of fading. And now, as I study his legacy, I wonder: is it wiser to secure what we have, or to rise and reclaim our strength?"
 dwarven.9975.a: "Ambition must sometimes give way to stability."
 dwarven.9975.b: "Endurance means little without strength to defend it."

 dwarven.9976.t: "Venerate the Ancestors: Thrár VI, the Valiant"
 dwarven.9976.desc: "The scroll bears the name of [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofthrarVI').GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal], who ruled in the [thirdage|E], as danger gathered around his people.\n\nThough the south had long turned inward, $Thr_ar$ rallied the [blacklocks|E] to war against the [orcish|E] dominion festering in ruined [GetTitleByKey('k_mablad_dum').GetNameNoTier]. Yet his strength lay not only in arms but also in diplomacy, for with shrewd counsel and unwavering conviction, he forged an alliance with Kôronânde.\n\nTogether, they turned back [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('nazgul4').GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal], the God-King of Mûmakan returned, and those who followed the $faith_indur$. Through $Thr_ar$'s resistance, the [nazgul|E]'s ambitions of conquest were thwarted as the God-King was forced to linger in the region far longer than he had foreseen, and the republic of Kôronânde stood unbroken against his onslaught.\n\nSuch was the legacy of $Thr_ar$ VI: defiance, unity, and a will unbent by fear."
 dwarven.9976.a: "In times of darkness, unity is the weapon that ensures survival."
 dwarven.9976.b: "Unity is valuable, but strength of arms is what secures victory."

 dwarven.9977.t: "Venerate the Ancestors: Rôn, the Exile"
 dwarven.9977.desc: "The scroll tells of [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofbarukodlig1').GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal], a distant scion of [thrar|E]'s second line and leader of the Exiles of [GetTitleByKey('k_nargubraz').GetNameNoTier] during the [warofthelie|E]. For decades, corruption spread as King [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('secondlineofthrar73').GetFirstNameRegnal] and his younger sons fell under [sauroncharacter|E]'s shadow while the eldest son [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('secondlineofthrar75').GetFirstNameRegnal] resisted. After Bhormûl's death in [ageTA|E] 2440, Bohûr ruled briefly before being slain by his brothers, igniting civil war.\n\nRôn led those not loyal to Sauron into exile at [GetTitleByKey('e_bizaruldum').GetNameNoTier], forging a war-host bound by vengeance. Nargubraz, allied with Ruartar, waged relentless war until the White Wizard [sarumancharacter|E] united the scattered forces near the conflict's end. Together with the [stonefoot|E] monarchs and [blacklocks|E] of Bizarûldûm, the Exiles of Nargubraz and the [men|E] of Lôkhas Drûs, Saruman's coalition defeated the shadow's proxy in T.A. 2459. Sauron fled, Ruartar's first iteration collapsed, and Nargubraz was sealed.\n\nAfter the conflict concluded, Rôn became the first Lord of the [axesofnargubraz|E]. His legacy endures through steadfast resolve and noble lineage as [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofbarukodlig3').GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal] married [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('secondlineofthrar77').GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal], uniting claims and strengthening their right to lead."
 dwarven.9977.a: "The axe remembers when the blood forgets."

 dwarven.9978.t: "Venerate the Ancestors: Gorovôd, the Goblinslayer"
 dwarven.9978.desc: "The scroll recounts the grim tale of [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofgorovod3').GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal], a relentless warrior of the [blacklocks|E] who fought under [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofthrarIII').GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal]. His hatred for [goblins|E] was not born on the battlefield but in childhood, when he watched helplessly as they took his sister [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofgorovod4').GetFirstNameRegnal]'s life during a raid near the northern marches. Gorovôd had always been shy in his early life, but from that day, he lived for vengeance and refused to ever take off his helmet. He joined Thrár's campaigns not for honour or coin, but to see Goblin blood spilled.\n\nWhen the armies of [GetTitleByKey('e_bizaruldum').GetNameNoTier] returned home, Gorovôd did not. He lingered in the northern deeps, hunting warbands and guarding forsaken passes long after the realm had withdrawn. When false word reached him that Thrár had fallen, his fury blazed anew, and he vanished into the dark, chasing the last echoes of war.\n\nIn his final stand, outnumbered and maimed in the lower tunnels, he ordered his companions to collapse the passage behind him. Alone, he held the line until the cave-in sealed his fate. No tomb bears his name, but in the deep places where Goblins linger, his legend remains a warning."
 dwarven.9978.a: "Some legacies are carved in blood, not stone."
 dwarven.9978.b: "His fury bought peace where none dared seek it."

 dwarven.9981.desc: "This scroll records the life of [bavorcold|E], [dwarffather|E] of the [stonefoots|E], who awoke beside [thrarproud|E] of the [blacklocks|E] in the [redmountains|E], in the vaulted deeps of [Glossary('Baruzkhizdîn','baruzkhizdin_gloss')]. Where [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofthrarI').GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal] was outspoken and swift to act, [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofbavorI').GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal] was quiet and deliberate, known for his calm, restrained manner and speaking rarely but with weight when he did.\n\nDuring his early reign, he delved the deep halls of [GetTitleByKey('k_baraz_lagil').GetNameNoTier], known for its red stone and rich gold veins, and founded the House of Bavór. The nearby [avari|E] gave him the name [Glossary('Mallin','malln_gloss')], and maintained peaceful relations with his folk. It was also during Bavór's rule that [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofzabad').GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal] founded the Jeweller's Guild, establishing a Stonefoot tradition of excellence in gemwork and ornament.\n\nThough Bavór and Thrár differed in temperament, their early cooperation laid the foundation for the shared legacy of the Blacklocks and Stonefoots. Their holds were distinct, but their alliance endured for generations."
 dwarven.9981.a: "His calm demeanour forged strong and lasting alliances."
 dwarven.9981.b: "His careful hand secured wealth and order for generations."

 dwarven.9982.desc: "This scroll records the deeds of [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofbavorII').GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal] of the [stonefoots|E], who came south in the early days of [GetTitleByKey('e_bizaruldum').GetNameNoTier] to support [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofthrarII').GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal] of the [blacklocks|E]. Though already aged when Thrár returned to life, Bavór brought with him wisdom, strength, and the bonds of kinship.\n\nHis daughter [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofbavor14').GetFirstNameRegnal] wed Thrár, and he became First-Vassal and North-King and Bizarûldûm, a title of high honour, though he never sought prominence. Where Thrár desired greatness and held the highest title as the realm's appointed ruler, Bavór was his equal in counsel, guiding quietly to keep their people united.\n\nIt is said that when Bavór arrived, Thrár laughed and declared it just as things should be: two clans, and two friends, hand in hand. Rumour says that Bavór dryly remarked that he had little choice, lest Thrar end up running headlong into foolish danger which would lead to much grief.\n\nTheir partnership formed the heart of early Bizarûldûm, not ruled by one over the other, but shaped by their differences and shared trust. The strength of their union outlasted them both."
 dwarven.9982.a: "Steadfast counsel shapes the mightiest plans."
 dwarven.9982.b: "Titles fade, but true wisdom endures."

While Thrár embarked upon decades of campaign in the northern [redmountains|E], Bavór stewarded the realm, and was vital in keeping wealth and supplies flowing northward, both to rebuild the realms and supply the armies marching. It is said that where [blacklock|E] armies descended, [stonefoot|E] masons were not far behind the erect fortifications and rebuild dilapidated halls.\n\nWhen at last Thrár passed and the warring largely subsided, it was Bavór, perhaps inspired by [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofthulinIII').GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal]'s unyielding defence of his ancestral mansion, who kept the strongholds intact, rebuilding halls, renewing alliances, and guiding the realm into calmer days. Divided, the flaws of both [dwarffathers_pluralshort|E] might have unraveled all they fought for. Together, they stood firm.\n\nGenerations later, after the fall of [eregion|E] in his effort to court [dwarven|E] favour and extend his influence among their kind, [sauroncharacter|E] would grant the [Concept('sevenringsofdwarves','Ring of the Stonefoots')|E] to [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofbavor26').GetFirstNameRegnal], descendant of Bavór III, which the Stonefoots would keep as an heirloom of their people."

Yet it was only many years later, during the long and steady reign of Bavór IV that these claims ceased to be actively pressed. As King of both North and South [GetTitleByKey('e_bizaruldum').GetNameNoTier] by blood and right, Bavór inherited a fractured land torn by years of strife.\n\nWhere Thrár IV had charged forward with boldness and zeal, Bavór IV brought measured patience and steady resolve. He led his people through an age of seclusion and careful restoration, working to mend broken alliances and rebuild battered holds. Though many [blacklocks|E] still lived in Bizarûldûm, their presence remained a source of tension after the [successionofbizaruldum|E].

Embracing his solitary nature, he devoted himself to creation, crafting masterworks in stone, paint, and ink alike.

While the [ironfists|E] became rich through their mastery of wrought iron, the Stonefoots won wealth and fame through the art of jewelcrafting. Zabad's works, renowned for their extravagant brilliance, were prized not only by his own folk but also by the other Free Peoples.\n\nZabad broke with much of [dwarven|E] custom in his pursuit of artistic craft. Under his guidance, the Stonefoots became preferred partners of the [elven|E]-King Tu of the Hisildi, who bartered fine woodworking and other goods of the surface for Stonefoot treasures. This trade brought rare dyes and pigments into Stonefoot hands, sparking an expansion of their skills into the arts of mural and painting, with a mastery now rivaling their gemcraft.\n\nThough his knowledge and craft brought great wealth to his kin, Zabad's greater legacy is the spirit of artistry that the Stonefoots uphold with pride to this day."
