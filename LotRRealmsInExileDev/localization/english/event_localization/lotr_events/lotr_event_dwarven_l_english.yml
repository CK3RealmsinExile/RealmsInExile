 dwarven.0101.t: "One Life, One Partner"
 dwarven.0101.desc.intro: "My spouse, [dead_character.GetTitledFirstName], has passed, leaving behind a life we built together. The halls feel colder now, and yet life continues.\n\nAmong our people, marriage is rare and not taken lightly. Most [dwarves|E] go through life alone, but those who find a partner are bound for life. "
 dwarven.0101.desc.no.dwarven.remarriage: "Such a bond is not merely of love, but of honour and permanence — a Dwarf marries only once, and no tradition permits a second union, even after death.\n\nThough grief may weigh heavily, I must now walk alone. To seek another would be to go against the ways of our people, and I know well that no Dwarf has ever done so and remained in honour."
 dwarven.0101.desc.dwarven.remarriage.allowed: "Such bonds are not easily set aside — even in death. Tradition holds that a Dwarf should not remarry, and those who do are often viewed with quiet disapproval.\n\nStill, no law forbids it. I must decide whether to honour tradition and remain alone, or seek another companion, knowing it will not be without judgement."
 dwarven.0101.a: "None shall take the place of [dead_character.GetTitledFirstName], in life or in memory."
 dwarven.0101.b: "May Mahal forgive me, but I long for warmth once more."

 dwarven.0205.t: "Gazing into Kheled-zâram"
 dwarven.0205.desc.1: "After leaving the Great Gates, I and my companions make our way down the vale to the long, tranquil lake. Kheled-zâram, whence [durin|E] gazed into, stands silent and still. Long do we gaze into it, contemplating the fate of our colony and what our next move should be. Do I see a hint of the ancient stars, set in a mighty crown? A sign, or perhaps a figment of my tired mind?\n\nYet suddenly the tranquility is broken by a terrible noise. We rise from our gazing, and turning around, dread like ice fills our veins. Rushing up the vale from the southeast is a band of [orcs|E], bows and swords in their hands. I hastily bark orders to retreat within the Gates. Yet though [Dwarves|E] may be sprinters, we are quickly set upon! Though we raise our axes and our armor stops many an arrow, there are simply too many. In the chaos we are separated, and I know not who lives and who dies. May [mahalcharacter|E] show mercy on us all."
 dwarven.0205.desc.2: "I go alone, an aged [dwarf|E] stooped from stress and cares. If my beard was not already white, it would assuredly be now! Once it had all shown such promise.\n\nMaking my way down the vale, I come at last to Kheled-zâram, whence [durin|E] gazed into, silent and still.\n\nGazing into its clear and cold depths, my mind turns, desperate for a solution. Do I see a hint of the ancient stars, set in a mighty crown? A sign, or perhaps a figment of my tired mind?\n\nYet suddenly the tranquility is broken by a terrible noise. Rising, I behold from the southeast a band of [orcs|E], rushing up the vale! Bows and arrows are in their hands, and wargs among their ranks. Ice fills my veins as I make for the Great Gates. Yet though my armor takes many arrows, finally one finds a chink in it. I fall to my knees, but scant feet from the Gate, my loyal companions rushing forth to face the foe.\n\nI feel faint. May [mahalcharacter|E] have mercy on us all. Forgive the foolishness of a wayward son."
 dwarven.0205.a: "Dáin... you were right..."
 dwarven.0205.b: "Gah!"

 dwarven.0210.t: "The Battle of Mazarbul"
 dwarven.0210.desc: "Though I live, it is not without injury or cost. Many warriors and friends who trusted me lie slain, at the Gates and in the halls. Yet more ill news is to come. The [orc|E] band we defeated, says the scouts, was but the vanguard of a great host of [orcs|E]. \n\nWe had thought them defeated, but it seems they were merely biding their time. I am filled at once with dread, doubt and self-contrition at my folly! Yet I do not let it show, for who shall lead if not I? I am the Lord of [Moria|E], and if today shall be my dying one, then I shall die as one.\n\nWith grim faces, my loyal followers set to work, preparing for the worst."
 dwarven.0210.a: "Drums. Drums in the deep. They come."
 
 ## Introduction ###

 dwarven.1000.t: "The Children of Mahal"
 dwarven.1000.desc: "I was born among the children of [mahalcharacter|E], adopted children of [eru|E], the steadfast [dwarves|E]. Our father shaped us in dark times, and as such, we are hardier than [conceptracemen|E] and more resistant to illnesses and corruption.\n\nWe are long-lived and slow to bloom: we consider our youths to be no more than children until the age of their [majority|El] at 40, and that it is inappropriate to marry before the age of 70. Few among us wed, and those who do, only once. Dwarves of both genders wear beards since birth, and a Dwarf without a beard is the object of much shame and mockery.\n\n[khuzdul|E], our sacred language devised by the [Concept('mahalcharacter', 'Maker')|E] himself, is never spoken in front of non-Dwarves and reserved for ancient lore and solemn gatherings. In everyday life we adopt the language of our closest neighbours and business partners.\n\nThough we do not fear the sun like the [orcs|E], we are most comfortable beneath the ground, where we carve halls in the living rock. Many of our ancestral homes have been destroyed, and now is the time to reclaim them!"
 dwarven.1000.a: "Baruk Khazâd! Khazâd ai-mênu!"

 dwarven.9500.t: "The Course of My Life"
 dwarven.9500.desc: "As I grow older, I begin to muse over my future. The major choice that now lies before me is whether to seek a mate or to focus first and foremost on my craft. It is not uncommon for a [dwarf|E] to take no mate and to focus instead on honing the act of my craft. Or perhaps the one I desire would not have me, or has chosen another! Regardless of the reason, there is no shame in either choice. Yet I must keep the legacy of my house and family in mind, so that it does not end with me..."
 dwarven.9500.a: "I shall seek a mate."
 dwarven.9500.b: "My craft calls to me!"
 
 dwarven.9700.t: "The Lonely Mountain is Ours"
 dwarven.9700.desc.evil: "For too long the accursed Dwarves of the [lonelymountain|E] have sat fat and proud upon their piles of gold, hiding behind the gates of their great Mountain. They have steadfastly defended their homes, their axes sharp and their armour nigh impervious. No longer.\n\nNow the Lonely Mountain is laid bare, its gates rent and its halls red with Dwarven blood. The riches of the Dwarves: shining jewels, precious gems, intricately carved weapons, and gold beyond measure and sorrow; all are ours to take and plunder. Long have many thought this realm unconquerable, save by dragonfire, but I have laid it bare."
 dwarven.9700.desc.good: "The fall of Erebor shocked many, and it was a great tragedy, akin to the Desolation of Smaug. Yet, though the memory of that failure still remains in our hearts, the sorrow of the loss is replaced now by joy and hope. The Lonely Mountain is ours once more, the filth that occupied it utterly cleansed, and a Dwarf now sits upon the throne. Just as the accursed dragon was vanquished, so were these savage occupiers."
 dwarven.9700.a: "Huzzah!"

 dwarven.9701.t: "The Fall of Erebor"
 dwarven.9701.desc: "Erebor, jewel of my people, has fallen. In a deed that will be long remembered by Dwarfkind, the gates of the Lonely Mountain fell, and enemies poured into the shimmering halls of the Dwarves. Just as when Smaug the Golden burned Dale and Erebor, countless are again driven into exile, and they look back upon their homeland with sorrow and grief, seeking to one day return to it again. I cannot let that filth pollute Erebor for long.\n\nWe shall return one day, and we shall have our vengeance in blood. Just as Smaug fell, let us vanquish the rabble that defiles our home!"
 dwarven.9701.a: "Let them fear the return of Mahal's children!"

 dwarven.9804.t: "Usurpation of the Throne"
 dwarven.9804.desc: "Perhaps the right of my [king.Custom('GetQueenKing')], [king.Custom('GetQueenKing')] [king.GetFirstName] to rule has come to its end. Rather than allow an illegitimate ruler to maintain their place on the throne, perhaps I should place a new [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetQueenKing')] on the throne? As I think of it, why should I even consider placing someone else upon the throne, when I myself am a perfectly capable candidate?\n\nPerhaps it is time that I take control of my House, that I claim the throne of my people. How should I go about doing so though? Through the threat of sword or dagger? By being a convincing diplomat and family [ROOT.Char.GetWomanMan]? Will [king.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] accept my rule, or will they resist me?\n\nDo I truly have the right to demand this of [king.GetHerHim]?"
 dwarven.9804.a: "Send [king.GetHerHim] notice that [king.GetSheHe] no longer rules our people."
 dwarven.9804.b: "I cannot do this, it is treason."

 dwarven.9805.t: "A New [claimant.Custom('GetQueenKing')]!?"
 dwarven.9805.desc: "My kins[claimant.GetWomanMan] [claimant.GetFirstName] has sent an outrageous message to my halls! [claimant.GetFirstName] claims that my rule over our people is illegitimate, and that [claimant.GetSheHe] is the true ruler of our House.\n\n[claimant.GetSheHe] asks me to step aside, to set aside my crown and my throne to become [claimant.GetHerHis] lesser, or [claimant.GetSheHe] shall remove me! The throne is mine by right, but is it worthwhile to resist, when I know that to do so will cost the lives of so many of my people? What is the right thing for a [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetQueenKing')] to do, when faced with such treason?"
 dwarven.9805.a: "If this traitor wants war, then [claimant.GetSheHe] will have it!"
 dwarven.9805.b: "I will not be the cause of unecessary deaths, I yield."

 dwarven.9806.t: "It will be War!"
 dwarven.9806.desc: "I have received word, [king.GetFirstName] has refused my offer and will not peacefully yield the throne of our people to me. I want no bloodshed, but [king.GetSheHe] forces my hand, for [king.GetHerHis] rule must continue no longer. Our people now suffer, because of [king.GetHerHis] choice."
 dwarven.9806.a: "It did not have to come to this, my kin."

 dwarven.9807.t: "A New [claimant.Custom('GetQueenKing')]"
 dwarven.9807.desc: "I have received word, [king.GetFirstName] has heeded my offer and has chosen to peacefully yield the throne of our people to me. It heartens me that [king.GetSheHe] chose not to sacrifice the lives of our people to satiate [king.GetHerHis] own ego.\n\nMy rule has begun, and my line shall assume the throne after me. As the new [claimant.Custom('GetQueenKing')], I must now decide how I will lead my people into this new age. What will the future hold in store for my reign? Will I lead them into a bright future or a glorious age? Or shall I be a worse [claimant.Custom('GetQueenKing')] than any who came before me?"
 dwarven.9807.a: "A new age begins for my people!"

 dwarven.9808.t: "A Crown of Victory"
 dwarven.9808.desc: "After refusing my offer to yield the throne peacefully, [king.GetFirstName] failed to even defend [king.GetHerHis] claim though war, as [king.GetSheHe] has been defeated.\n\nMy rule has begun, and my line shall assume the throne after me. As the new [claimant.Custom('GetQueenKing')], I must now decide how I will lead my people into this new age. What will the future hold in store for my reign? Will I lead them into a bright and glorious future? Or shall I be a worse [claimant.Custom('GetQueenKing')] than any who came before me?"
 dwarven.9808.a: "A new age begins for my people!"

 dwarven.9809.t: "Humiliated in Defeat"
 dwarven.9809.desc: "My kins[claimant.GetWomanMan] [claimant.GetFirstName] has bested me.\n\nI only fought to protect what [mahalcharacter|E] had given me against that traitor, and yet, his favour has passed from my face. [claimant.GetFirstName] now rules as [claimant.Custom('GetQueenKing')], for better or for ill."
 dwarven.9809.a: "I can only hope they will not ruin what I have accomplished."

 dwarven.9810.t: "My Endeavour has Failed"
 dwarven.9810.desc: "[king.GetFirstName] still rules our people as [king.Custom('GetQueenKing')], I have been bested.\n\n[mahalcharacter|E] stll stands with [king.GetHerHim], it was my own folly that drove me to this point, that killed our people for my own selfish desires."
 dwarven.9810.a: "To desire another's throne is foolishness."

 dwarven.9900.t: "Venerate the Ancestors: Into the Archives"
 dwarven.9900.desc: "I follow [realm_priest.GetCouncilTitle] [realm_priest.GetFirstName] into the lower halls, where the air is dry and still. Shelves of ledgers and worn scrolls line the room, each holding fragments of long-kept memory.\n\nWithout a word, [realm_priest.GetSheHe] begins scanning the seals and markings, moving with the ease of someone who knows exactly where to look. Soon, [realm_priest.GetSheHe] finds what [realm_priest.GetSheHe]'s after and hands me a scroll.\n\nI take it and sit down. The script is aged and the edges brittle, but the words remain clear."

To reclaim [erebor|E] he set out with twelve [dwarven|E] companions, a [hobbit|E] burglar, and a [Concept('gandalfcharacter', 'Wizard')|E], braving many perils on the road to the [lonelymountain|E]...\n\nWhen Smaug was felled, it was not the [dwarves|E], but [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'lineofdale46' ).GetFirstName] 'the Bowman' who slew the beast with a great Black Arrow.\n\nErebor's riches were reclaimed, but when [men|E] and [elves|E] came to claim their share, Thorin sealed off Erebor.

 dwarven.9904.t: "Venerate the Ancestors: Gorin I, Discoverer of Nordinbad"
 dwarven.9904.desc: "The record before me recounts the journey of [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('linegorin0').GetFirstName], the first of his name, whose steps carried him deep into the northern wilds in the days when the [longbeards|E] abandoned [erebor|E], the stronghold founded by [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofdurin74').GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal], to follow [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofdurin75').GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal] into the [greymountains|E]. Among those migrants was Gorin, who beheld the hidden lake of Azan-zâram, still and starlit in the high cold, and there he carved the first halls of [nordinbad|E].\n\nAt that time, many of [durinsfolk|E] still toiled in the region, but doom drew near.

In the bitter years that followed, the Grey Mountains were forsaken, their holds left to ruin. Only Nordinbad endured, its people clinging to the mountain as their forefather once had.\n\nWas it fate that drew Gorin to that secret lake, or something else entirely? Whatever the truth, it is by his hand that the Longbeards' legacy was allowed to endure in the North when all else was swallowed by shadow."
 dwarven.9904.a: "His courage endures in our hearts and stone."
 dwarven.9904.b: "Gorin was a fool to settle in this forsaken place."

Led by [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'lineofdwalin7' ).GetFirstName]'s second son [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'secondlineofdwalin1' ).GetFirstName], who established his own cadet branch of Dwálin's line, they carved new halls in [GetTitleByKey('d_tagakhgershad').GetNameNoTier] of the northern [eredluin|E].\n\nThe [firebeards|E] too were divided; with [nogrod|E] destroyed, half journeyed east, while the rest, led by [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'lineofuri5' ).GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal], spurned the offer of aid and founded the mansion of [GetTitleByKey('k_buzra_dum').GetNameNoTier] in the southern [bluemountains|E], though it could not rival Nogrod's splendor."
 dwarven.9942.a: "We honor the Broadbeams, who chose wisdom over pride."

Since their migration in the late [firstage|E], some [broadbeams|E] in Khazad-dûm gradually merged into [longbeard|E] culture.

 dwarven.9951.desc: "The record speaks of [sindririch|E], the great smith and forefather of the [ironfists|E], or [sindrisfolk|E]. A master of craft and tireless seeker of secrets, [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofsindri0').GetFirstName] was the first among [dwarves|E] to unlock the working of iron while others still wrought in bronze. From this gift flowed uncountable riches, and the halls of his folk gleamed with splendour, and so he was named 'the Rich'.\n\nYet with fortune came pride. After his passing, the Ironfists grew bold, and when the other clans came close to uncovering the secrets of iron, they broke the ancient accords and seized an iron-rich hold from the Stiffbeards by force. In response, the [stiffbeards|E], [blacklocks|E] and [stonefoots|E] formed a league, refused all trade with the Ironfists and eventually uncovered the secrets of iron for themselves. When the Ironfists, still confident in their strength, pressed for the reopening of trade or war, the Three Clans refused, demanding restitution and return of the stolen lands.\n\nThus began the [warofiron|E]. The Ironfists were ultimately harshly defeated, severely underestimating their opposition and most were exiled to the Ered Harmal. The small remnant that remained in the [redmountains|E] were viewed as traitors for making peace with the other clans."
 dwarven.9951.a: "Let our legacy be etched in craft, as his was."
