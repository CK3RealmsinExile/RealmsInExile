 dwarven.0205.t:0 "Gazing into Kheled-zâram"
 dwarven.0205.desc.1:0 "After leaving the Great Gates, I and my companions make our way down the vale to the long, tranquil lake. Kheled-zâram, whence [durin|E] gazed into, stands silent and still. Long do we gaze into it, contemplating the fate of our colony and what our next move should be. Do I see a hint of the ancient stars, set in a mighty crown? A sign, or perhaps a figment of my tired mind?\n\nYet suddenly the tranquility is broken by a terrible noise. We rise from our gazing, and turning around, dread like ice fills our veins. Rushing up the vale from the south-east is a band of orcs, bows and swords in their hand. I hastily bark orders to retreat within the Gates. Yet though Dwarves may be sprinters, we are quickly set upon! Though we raise our axes and our armor stops many an arrow, there are simply too many. In the chaos we are separated, and I know not who lives and who dies. May Mahal show mercy on us all."
 dwarven.0205.desc.2:0 "I go alone, an aged dwarf stooped from stress and cares. If my beard was not already white, it would assuredly be now! Once it had all shown such promise.\n\nMaking my way down the vale, I come at last to Kheled-zâram, whence [durin|E] gazed into, silent and still.\n\nGazing into its clear and cold depths, my mind turns, desperate for a solution. Do I see a hint of the ancient stars, set in a mighty crown? A sign, or perhaps a figment of my tired mind?"\n\nYet suddenly the tranquility is broken by a terrible noise. Rising, I behold from the south-east a band of orcs, rushing up the vale! Bows and arrows are in their hands, and wargs among their ranks. Ice fills my veins as I make for the Great Gates. Yet though my armor takes many arrows, finally one finds a chink in it. I fall to my knees, but scant feet from the Gate, my loyal companions rushing forth to face the foe.\n\nI feel faint. May Mahal have mercy on us all. Forgive the foolishness of a wayward son."
 dwarven.0205.a:0 "Dain... you were right..."
 dwarven.0205.b:0 "Gah!"

 dwarven.0210.t:0 "The Battle of Mazarbul"
 dwarven.0210.desc:0 "Though I live, it is not without injury or cost. Many warriors and friends who trusted me lie slain, at the Gates and in the halls. Yet more ill news is to come. The orc band we defeated, says the scouts, was but the vanguard of a great host of orcs. \n\nWe had thought them defeated, but it seems they were merely biding their time. I am filled at once with dread doubt and self-contrition at my folly! Yet I do not let it show, for who shall lead if not I? I am the Lord of Moria, and if today shall be my dying one, then I shall die as one.\n\nWith grim faces, my loyal followers set to work, preparing for the worst."
 dwarven.0210.a:0 "Drums. Drums in the deep. They come."
 
 ## Introduction ###

 dwarven.1000.t:0 "The Children of Mahal"
 dwarven.1000.desc:0 "I was born among the children of [mahalcharacter|E], adopted children of [eru|E], the steadfast [dwarves|E]. Our father shaped us in dark times, and as such we are hardier than [conceptracemen|E], and more resistant to illnesses and corruption.\n\nWe are long-lived and slow to bloom: we consider our youths to be no more than children until the age of their [majority|El] at 40, and that it is inappropriate to marry before the age of 70. Dwarves of both genders wear beards since birth, and a Dwarf without a beard is the object of much shame and mockery.\n\nKhuzdul, our sacred language devised by the Maker himself, is never spoken in front of non-Dwarves and reserved for ancient lore and solemn gatherings. In every day life we adopt the language of our closest neighbours and business partners.\n\nThough we do not fear the sun like the [orcs|E], we are most comfortable beneath the ground, where we carve halls in the living rock. Many of our ancestral homes have been destroyed, and now is the time to reclaim them!"
 dwarven.1000.a:0 "Baruk Khazâd! Khazâd ai-mênu!"
