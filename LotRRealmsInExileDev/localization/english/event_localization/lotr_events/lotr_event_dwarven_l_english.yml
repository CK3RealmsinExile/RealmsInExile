 dwarven.0205.t:0 "Gazing into Kheled-zâram"
 dwarven.0205.desc.1:0 "After leaving the Great Gates, I and my companions make our way down the vale to the long, tranquil lake. Kheled-zâram, whence [durin|E] gazed into, stands silent and still. Long do we gaze into it, contemplating the fate of our colony and what our next move should be. Do I see a hint of the ancient stars, set in a mighty crown? A sign, or perhaps a figment of my tired mind?\n\nYet suddenly the tranquility is broken by a terrible noise. We rise from our gazing, and turning around, dread like ice fills our veins. Rushing up the vale from the south-east is a band of [orcs|E], bows and swords in their hand. I hastily bark orders to retreat within the Gates. Yet though [Dwarves|E] may be sprinters, we are quickly set upon! Though we raise our axes and our armor stops many an arrow, there are simply too many. In the chaos we are separated, and I know not who lives and who dies. May [mahalcharacter|E] show mercy on us all."
 dwarven.0205.desc.2:0 "I go alone, an aged [dwarf|E] stooped from stress and cares. If my beard was not already white, it would assuredly be now! Once it had all shown such promise.\n\nMaking my way down the vale, I come at last to Kheled-zâram, whence [durin|E] gazed into, silent and still.\n\nGazing into its clear and cold depths, my mind turns, desperate for a solution. Do I see a hint of the ancient stars, set in a mighty crown? A sign, or perhaps a figment of my tired mind?"\n\nYet suddenly the tranquility is broken by a terrible noise. Rising, I behold from the south-east a band of [orcs|E], rushing up the vale! Bows and arrows are in their hands, and wargs among their ranks. Ice fills my veins as I make for the Great Gates. Yet though my armor takes many arrows, finally one finds a chink in it. I fall to my knees, but scant feet from the Gate, my loyal companions rushing forth to face the foe.\n\nI feel faint. May [mahalcharacter|E] have mercy on us all. Forgive the foolishness of a wayward son."
 dwarven.0205.a:0 "Dain... you were right..."
 dwarven.0205.b:0 "Gah!"

 dwarven.0210.t:0 "The Battle of Mazarbul"
 dwarven.0210.desc:0 "Though I live, it is not without injury or cost. Many warriors and friends who trusted me lie slain, at the Gates and in the halls. Yet more ill news is to come. The [orc|E] band we defeated, says the scouts, was but the vanguard of a great host of [orcs|E]. \n\nWe had thought them defeated, but it seems they were merely biding their time. I am filled at once with dread doubt and self-contrition at my folly! Yet I do not let it show, for who shall lead if not I? I am the Lord of [Moria|E], and if today shall be my dying one, then I shall die as one.\n\nWith grim faces, my loyal followers set to work, preparing for the worst."
 dwarven.0210.a:0 "Drums. Drums in the deep. They come."
 
 ## Introduction ###

 dwarven.1000.t:0 "The Children of Mahal"
 dwarven.1000.desc:0 "I was born among the children of [mahalcharacter|E], adopted children of [eru|E], the steadfast [dwarves|E]. Our father shaped us in dark times, and as such we are hardier than [conceptracemen|E], and more resistant to illnesses and corruption.\n\nWe are long-lived and slow to bloom: we consider our youths to be no more than children until the age of their [majority|El] at 40, and that it is inappropriate to marry before the age of 70. Dwarves of both genders wear beards since birth, and a Dwarf without a beard is the object of much shame and mockery.\n\nKhuzdul, our sacred language devised by the Maker himself, is never spoken in front of non-Dwarves and reserved for ancient lore and solemn gatherings. In every day life we adopt the language of our closest neighbours and business partners.\n\nThough we do not fear the sun like the [orcs|E], we are most comfortable beneath the ground, where we carve halls in the living rock. Many of our ancestral homes have been destroyed, and now is the time to reclaim them!"

Regardless of the reason, there is no shame in either choice. Yet I must keep the legacy of my house and family in mind, so that it does not end with me..."

 ### Balin Events
 
 balin_event_chain.0100.title:0 "Supplies For The Trip"
 balin_event_chain.0100.desc:0 "The trip to Kheled-zâram will be long and extremely dangerous. With the likelihood of travelling through Goblin territory and the ever present threat of Durin's Bane there will certainly be many obstacles along the way. However, they say that with great risk comes great reward, and the morale of the Expedition has been waning of late. A reminder of our righteous mission will renew their vigour.\n\n Now, proper planning is half the battle, and with some additional cost, I can ensure that this expedition is well prepared for the trials ahead. I just have to decide if the equipment for this journey is worth cutting corners elsewhere."
 balin_event_chain.0100.a:0 "I must ensure I have everything I need for the journey"
 balin_event_chain.0100.b:0 "I need to travel light"
 balin_event_chain.0100.c:0 "My companions and I shall want for nothing on this expedition"
 balin_event_chain.0100.d:0 "It would be better to save our limited funds"
 balin_event_chain.0100.e:0 "Every Dwarf on this expedition will be fully equipped"
 balin_event_chain.0100.f:0 "We cannot afford to equip every Dwarf"
 
 balin_event_chain.0101.title:0 "Shadow and Flame"
 balin_event_chain.0101.desc:0 "I leave Mazarbul with a clarity of purpose intially. But as the Kheled-zâram is quite a distance away, already I can feel the weight of my mission upon my shoulders. Doubt begins to creep in. The fate of the expedition rested on my shoulders and I was putting myself at great risk on this expedition. But my own morale depends on this trip, and so I must go through with it.\n\nAnd already I'm stuck with two terrible choices before me. We only have claim to a very limited portion of Khazad Dum, with the rest being Goblin Territory, or too close to where Durin's Bane regularly slumbers. And it is one of those two that I am now being forced to march through.\n\nWhile I can possibly sneak by Durin's Bane, if I make a mistake and rouse it's anger the consequences will be dire. Whereas if I go through Goblin territory, I will almost certainly be spotted, but it won't anger them anymore than they already have been."
 balin_event_chain.0101.a:0 "With deft steps and light fingers, I can avoid disturbing Durin's Bane" 
 balin_event_chain.0101.b:0 "I'll have to risk Goblin Territory"
 balin_event_chain.0101.c:0 "With deft steps and light fingers, we can avoid disturbing Durin's Bane" 
 balin_event_chain.0101.d:0 "We'll have to risk Goblin Territory"
 balin_event_chain.0101.e:0 "There's too many of us to risk Durin's Bane, we'll have to go through Goblin Territory." 
 
 balin_event_chain.0102.title: "The Bridge of Durin"
 balin_event_chain.0102.desc: "Avoiding Durin's Bane was a necessary step in moving through the Hallowed Halls, but one that we have grown accustomed too since arriving. With deft steps and clever thinking we have been able to avoid Shadow and Death rather effectively. Now however, comes a moment that any Dwarf would dread. A place where no amount of clever thinking can find an alternative. The Bridge of Durin is a narrow stretch which provides no cover from the outside, and goes over a giant chasm. And unfortunately, the only hopes we have now are that the Goblins are not watching us as we cross."
 balin_event_chain.0102.a:0 "There is no other way, the bridge must be crossed"
 
 balin_event_chain.0103.title:0 "Fresh Air"
 balin_event_chain.0103.desc:0 "For the first time in what seems like an age, the light of the sun shines upon me as I step out into the open air. I have not been under the sun in many years it feels. It didn't fit for the Lord of Khazad Dum to leave those same Halls and leave the expedition without a leader.\n\nI take a moment to simply bask in the heat of the sun, arms stretched out. I know that the journey ahead to Kheled-zâram is still long and arduous, and that I am still within territory that the various Goblin tribes within the Halls claim... but a short rest here would certainly do wonders to help me avoid the fatigue of hard travel."
 balin_event_chain.0103.a:0 "I can rest for a while, gather myself for the road ahead"
 balin_event_chain.0103.b:0 "I can't risk being spotted, I must press on"
 balin_event_chain.0103.c:0 "It's too risky for us to remain here"
 balin_event_chain.0103.d:0 "With so many of us we cannot stay in one place for too long"
 
 balin_event_chain.0104.title:0 "A Narrow Pass"
 balin_event_chain.0104.desc:0 "The road down to the vale is treacherous. Narrow and eroded from years of neglect, with the edges crumbling away into the abyss below. Each step I take feels uncertain, as if the ground beneath me could give way at any moment. My boots knock loose stones that tumble down the cliffside, disappearing into the shadows far below.\n\nWind whips through the cracks in the stones, making our already precarious balancing act far more difficult. The air feels heavy with unease as we approach the narrowest stretch of the path, clinging tight to the mountainside. One wrong move here, and a slip could send someone tumbling down the jagged rocks, crashing hard onto the ground below. I know I’d be lucky to walk away with just a few broken bones and no further damage if I suffered that fall, but I can't concern myself with what will happen if I fall. The opportunity to turn back was forfeited already, and so with steeled nerves I press on, my heart pounding with every cautious step." 
 balin_event_chain.0104.a:0 "Just put one foot in front of the other..."
 
 balin_event_chain.0105.title:0 "A Goblin Patrol"
 balin_event_chain.0105.desc:0 "When we came to Khazad Dum, we had expected that Durin's Bane would be our greatest obstacle. A foe that we would struggle to defeat. While it is certainly still the greatest obstacle to restoring these Hallowed Halls, we have been able to get by so far by ensuring we do not disturb the creature.\n\nUnfortunately, those who came into Moria to replace us have been far more difficult to manage. The Goblins of Moria have been far more active and far more aggressive than Durin's Bane. We have struggled against their tribal, territorial claims for years now, and it is only because the tribes hate each other almost as much as they hate us that we are still standing today.\n\nAnd so, knowing that the Goblins are patrolling so close to Kheled-zâram, while not a surprise, only angers me more. Once again they come between me and restoring these Halls. A patrol is moving along the path I am travelling along, and while Goblins aren't particularly observant creatures, they aren't completely blind.\n\nSneaking past them would be the safest option, but I can already feel a rage building inside me at the mere sight of them."
 balin_event_chain.0105.a:0 "Sneaking around them would be wise"
 balin_event_chain.0105.b:0 "If I'm fast and fearsome, they won't stand a chance"
 balin_event_chain.0105.c:0 "My companions and I can handle this"
 balin_event_chain.0105.d:0 "Stealth isn't an option, we have to take them head on!"
 
 balin_event_chain.0106.title:0 "Dimril Dale"
 balin_event_chain.0106.desc:0 "And so I can finally see my destination laid out before me. The Moon is full overhead, casting its light down onto the water that seems a mirror of the night sky above it like reflective glass. I make my way down the path now, my steps slow and almost reverent. I glance about, seeing nothing that could disturb the tranquil moment, I refocus my gaze onto Kheled-zâram, content with the knowledge that nothing would stop me from gazing into the waters now.\n\n I quickly manage to spot Durin's Stone, and stop to look upon it for a time. A relic of the days of old, much like I am. Maybe I can help bring Durin's Folk back to the glory of the past by restoring our ancient home.\n\nBut now is not the time for that sort of thought. I stare onto the deep, blue waters of the Lake before me, and feel determination fill my body. It is time."
 balin_event_chain.0106.a:0 "I approach the waters..."
 
 balin_event_chain.0107.title:0 "The Mirrormere"
 balin_event_chain.0107.desc:0 "With every step I take I can feel a pit growing in my stomach. What if I couldn't find Durin's Crown? What if an Orc was hiding nearby? What if I came here for nothing? All these 'What ifs' are making my heart burn. Despite the cool air I could feel the sweat building upon my brow. With every step I take it feels like my feet get heavier. My grip on my axe tightens, and I glance side to side.\n\nI pass by Durin's Stone, giving it only a quick glance as I move slowly towards the waters. I finally reach the waters, and fall to my knees before them with a thud. I look up to the sky and take a final, deep breath before I prepare to turn my head down to gaze into the waters.\n\nAnd then a pain spreads through my chest. When I look down I see not a the lake, but an arrow. One that found its way through a crack in my armor and struck true. The pain is like fire, and I bring a hand up to grasp the poorly wrought shaft, only for another to strike me in the chest again. I don't even see where the arrows come from before I fall forward, crashing into the Kheled-zâram with a loud splash.\n\nThe deep blues are stained with red, and I can feel the strength leaving my body. I sink into the water, and see a twinkle around my head. With the last of my strength, I bring my head up, to see the seven stars of Durin's Crown shining down on me, their light forming a crown around my head even as I sink deeper into the water."
 balin_event_chain.0107.a:0 "Has it all been for nothing?"
 
 balin_event_chain.0108.title:0 "The Mirrormere"
 balin_event_chain.0108.desc:0 "With every step I take I can feel a pit growing in my stomach. What if I couldn't find Durin's Crown? What if an Orc was hiding nearby? What if I came here for nothing? All these 'What ifs' are making my heart burn. Despite the cool air I could feel the sweat building upon my brow. With every step I take it feels like my feet get heavier. My grip on my axe tightens, and I glance side to side.\n\nThough after I pass Durin's Stone, it almost feels as if a weight has been lifted from my shoulders. The Deathless stood in this very spot so many years ago, and now I was walking the same steps. He had built Khazad Dum from nothing, so surely I could rebuild upon the foundations he wrought. My boots finally reach the edge of the lake, and I fall to my knees. I look up to the sky and take a final, deep breath before I turn my head down to gaze into the waters.\n\nThere are so many stars in our sky, and the Moon shines with its dazzling silver light. Yet of the thousands in the sky, I'm looking for just seven. I look closely, and amongst the many, I spot a few that shine brighter than the others. Six, pointing up and inwards with a perfect symmetry, and at the peak, a single star, brighter than the rest.\n\nThere is no mistaking it. No other stars would be so perfectly arranged. I reach down to the waters trying to touch the image, but pause before I disturb the waters. I remain for some time, simply staring into the mirrored waters, the night tranquil." 
 balin_event_chain.0108.a:0 "What once was believed is now proven. I am the rightful Lord of Khazad Dum!" 
 
 balin_event_chain.0109.title:0 "The Return Home"
 balin_event_chain.0109.desc:0 "The return trip is far less eventful than the trek to view the Kheled-zâram. Fortunate tidings indeed as we have come to learn that eventful treks are far from desired for their danger here in Khazad Dum. But despite the difficulties of the journey the mood in the expedition is high. I have witnessed the crown of stars over my head, proving me to be the rightful Lord of Khazad Dum, and showing that this expedition is just.\n\nThough now I feel a calling from the Halls, where the ruined Throne of Durin sits. It would be seen as improper to sit upon it under normal circumstances, but I have beheld the Crown of Stars, and so there will be no pushback from the Dwarves of the expedition.\n\nFinally it is time to truly set about restoring these hallowed halls rather than simply picking up the scraps of our forebearers. Khazad Dum shall be restored and Durin's Folk will prosper in the Misty Mountains once again."

We still hold the passage but hope is now gone. \n\nÓins party went 5 days ago but only 4 returned: the pool is up to the wall at Westgate: the Watcher in the Water took Óin. We have barred the gates but cannot hold them for long. \n\nThe ground shakes...drums, drums in the deep. We cannot get out. The shadow moves in the dark. \n\nWe cannot get out."
 balin_event_chain.0110.a:0 "They are coming..."
 
 balin_event_chain.0111.title:0 "Punish the Dwarves"
 balin_event_chain.0111.desc:0 "The Dwarves have been a nuisance since arriving in our realm some time ago. Due to struggles with the other tribes however, I have been unable to focus my efforts on truly crushing them yet. But their recent expedition to their precious lake has caused a significant headache, with them slaying many of our kin and trespassing on our lands.\n\nThis is surely what we need in order to force the other to follow us to war and clear them from these halls. Only this time, they won't escape."
 balin_event_chain.0111.a:0 "Sound the drums!"
 balin_event_chain.0111.b:0 "We must bide our time" 
 
 balin_event_chain.0112.title:0 "March to War"
 balin_event_chain.0112.desc:0 "It seems that the Dwarf Cutter is moving his troop after the Dwarves that have set themselves up in Moria. It's previously been quite difficult to be in a position to attack them while they're holed up within their chamber without taking serious casualties that would put us at risk of falling to our rival tribes.\n\nWhile the Dwarves previously took advantage of this situation, their recent expedition managed to anger many of the major tribes within Moria, and now we might be able to strike them without fear of one of the other tribes taking advantage of our weakness afterwards."

 # Smaug sacking Erebor events
 smaug_event_chain.0100.title:0 "Fire and Death"
 smaug_event_chain.0100.dwarf.desc:0 "In the night I awake suddenly, stirred by the sounds of chaos, in the dale ring bells wildly. Fellow Dwarves rush around me, faces pale, and I am grabbed before I even know what is happening. Amidst the clamour I make out a single word:\n\n#emp Dragon#!.\n\nThere is screaming, distant and faint, but it is drowned out as my ears are consumed by the hideous screech of flame. I rush to the great windows, possessed by shock, and I see only billowing black smoke and snarling red fire.\n\nIt is all consuming. All of it. The shadow of great wings fall upon me. I stumble. There is a flash of scales, red and golden, yet before I get a full view of the [dragon|E] I am pulled aside by my guards."

 smaug_event_chain.0100.orc.desc:0 "I am up patrolling the parapets with my iron-clad bodyguard, idly inspecting some good Orcish stonework, when heat envelops me - the hot air cracks my lips and in the distance, I hear great gales of wind roaring ever closer. We Orcs have dark-eyes but I don't need them - the smell hits me first. The stink of charred wood and flesh assails my nose, creeping into my nostrils and watery eyes, and I shy away from the wall. My soldiers haven't had a good raid for a little while. So who is...?\n\nThen I see it, against the ever-growing dimness of the smog in the vale, high in the night before the moon. A great shadow, with smoke and fire trailing behind it, carried in the sky by a raging wind. And though I have never seen this thing before, somehow I know its nature, from age-old memories of torture and death felt in my body. I can feel my eyes growing wide with fear and awe even as the clouds of ash force them closed. Then my mouth speaks without my command, and I shout:\n\n#emp Dragon#! My bodyguards, loyal as can be for Orcs, jump to, and we break for the back-entrance, long-loping legs in our favor. Bells and cries, and shouts of rage and fear, begin to ring."
 smaug_event_chain.0100.desc:0 "First I hear the wind, moaning in the black and balmy night, like a hurricane descending from the north. It stirs me from my rest, and I wander to my balcony to see what is happening. With each step my eyes droop, and sleep calls to me. The air feels dry upon my skin.\n\nThen ring the bells. They are loud, piercing the night, and they jolt me awake as if a rushing torrent of icy water was thrown upon me. My eyes fall immediately upon the guards of the wall, and I see they look into the sky with pale faces. The howling wind grows louder, and I look up too.\n\nAgainst the of the moon expands the shadow of a pair of great black wings, and before I can even gasp, my ears are filled with the hideous screech of flame. Immediately I am grabbed by my shouting guards, and the bells grow louder."

The men, women, and children of [primary_title.GetName] rush past me, but I heft my axe and stand. Fear and adrenaline course through my heart, and my retinue and I slowly step back.\n\nThe [dragon|E] roars, and fire fills the corridor fr ahead of me. Behind me is a secret exit, a back door, ever so close yet so far. Someone must hold off the dragon, if we are to escape.\n\nYet before I may even give an order, there is a roar in the hall. Not one of a dragon nor savage beast, but one of a company of Dwarves. Around me rush countless of them, armor shimmering in the light of fire and axes swinging with the fury of the sons of Durin, and they rush forth, eyes alight with rage.\n\nThey will not return. I gulp and turn, and as I close the door behind me, I hear their rageful screams. The wind moans in the night."

 smaug_event_chain.0101.orc.desc:0 "The roar of flame is cut only by the lash of the whips, as my taskmasters get to work herding the few orcs who aren't allowed to pick up weapons out of our hold, pressing in their hands as much loot and supplies as they can carry. But rioters are everywhere, and me and my folk cut down an few unfortunate snagas who thought they could make the best of the situation. Quickly now, we make our way to the end of the orc-hold, surrounded by archers loosing poison-darts from bows of horn. But all the might of Orcish artillery is for naught - I watch in terror as the bolts bounce off the golden scales of the great beast, shimmering red in the light of the fire. In return, it sends a volley of flame, and stone and flesh chars as I hear my orcs scream. My heart is pounding, and we make for the exit quick-like, while the flame of the dragon roils and rumbles through the hold. I signal to my bodyguard, and they quickly hack off the legs of any of those too unfortunate to be at the back of the train.\n\nWe leave them for the dragon, while we fly like birds, our feathers fanned by a fiery breeze."
 smaug_event_chain.0101.desc:0 "Driven by the ringing of the bells I descend the flights of stairs, surrounded by my guards and family, and my heart races. Sweat drips down my forehead as I hear the screams of men and the roar of fire and destruction. Only when I am out once more can I finally see the situation.\n\nSmoke rises, thick and blacker than the sky, as the dragon swoops in once more. There is a twang of arrows as a volley fires in unison, but I can only watch in horror as they bounce off. Innocent people rush all around me, the sounds of their terror resounding in the night. At the piercing shrill of a horn charge forth warriors clad in armor, but within seconds they are ash before the dragon's ire. Towers collapse in booming explosions of brick and stone, houses are turned to rubble in seconds, and as my guards lead me from the city, I cannot muster a sound.\n\nThe bells ring in the dale."

Dale, the great city, is too consumed, for its rooves and houses burn, and its walls are laid bare, and its people huddle under the shadow of night.\n\nAnd last of all I look upon the [dragon|E], its shape visible as it flies against the moon.

The dragon has claimed its prize, though I wish it was mine, but more than Erebor I wish for the safety of my hold. I clench my hands and stamp my feet as I look upon the [dragon|E], that beast high above the clouds. Oh, how I wish I could throttle him! I clutch at my sword's hilt, rageful and frothing. But thoughs of vengeance gives way to tiredness. \n\nThe bells keep ringing, ever so faintly, just out of reach."

I must consider my options.\n\nFar in the west the realms of the [dwarves|E] of the [bluemountains|E] live in prosperity, and though their mansions are a far cry from the great realms of [nogrod|E] and [belegost|E], their realms are mighty still and far from most danger. It would make a perfect place for my kin to live and prosper, but the road there will be long and beset by perils.\n\nYet my heart calls me to a different place altogether. Long have I dreamt and thought of the splendour of [khazaddum|E]: its golden roofs and silver floors and mighty pillars carved from living rock, shimmering in the undimmed light of lamps hewn from crystal. It is fallen, yes, and many would say to go there would be utterly foolish.\n\nPerhaps they are right, but it is as if [mahalcharacter|E] himself beckons me."
