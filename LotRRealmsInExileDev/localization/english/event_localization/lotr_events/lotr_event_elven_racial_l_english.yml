It is principally our faith, [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetName] that arrays them against us, as they perceive in it the worship of their oldest foes.\n\nIf we sincerely repented and rejected the faith of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetName], then they would surely show leniency and mercy.

As such, I am not subject to the vicissitudes of mortals.\n\nWe do not suffer from illnesses or old age and may only die from grievous wounds or terrible sorrow.\n\nWe [marry|El] only out of love and believe the [soulmates|El]'s fëa becomes intermingled in the process. For us, having a child is a conscious [decision|El], and we will only raise one at a time until they reach their [majority|El] at the age of 50.\n\nNone of our kind has married a child of [conceptracemen|E] since the legendary heroes of the Edain, in the [firstage|E], and none will do so again unless ordained by [eru|E].\n\nWe rule from [elven_refuges|E], and rarely do our armies leave our homes unless to reclaim our invaded homelands, to assist a neighbour beset by the forces of Evil, or to cleanse the lands of worshippers of [sauronthedarklordcharacter|E]."

### Sailing West ###

 elven_racial.1000.t: "The Road West"
 elven_racial.1000.a.desc: "For many years I have dwelt on this hither shore, and leaves have grown like the branching years. Yet ever there has been an unquiet in my heart, a longing unfufilled for my long home in the West. Now at last the time has come to act on that desire, leaving the sorrows and memories of [middleearth|E] for the promise of [valinor|E]."
 elven_racial.1000.cirdan.desc: "I have long tended the Grey Havens, but at last my watch has come to an end, and I am at liberty to depart on the Last Ship."
 elven_racial.1000.amroth.desc: "I haven long tended this haven of the [elves|E], and sent many a ship over water. Now at least my own time has come to depart myself and sail west from Cobas Haven."
 elven_racial.1000.edhellond.desc: "To the south lies Edhellond, haven of the Sindar upon the coasts of Gondor. There on the Bay of Belfalas I might aquire a ship to bear me across the sea."
 elven_racial.1000.mithlond.desc: "I might fare westward still to the Grey Havens, in the land of Lindon the long-guarded. They dwells Cirdan the Shipwright, tending them until the Last Ship sails."
 elven_racial.1000.coast.desc: "Apart from any haven near or far, I might go to the coast on my own in quiet contemplation, to build my own ship before sailing into the west. "
 elven_racial.1000.b.desc: "Seaward I go, to seek the West, and fields and mountains ever blest. I hear the call, and journey long before me lies."

 elven_racial.1001.t: "The Havens"
 elven_racial.1001.desc: "Though many of my people sail west from one of our havens, not all depart from an established port. By chance or choice I have made my way to the shore, and here have I contructed my own ship. It is a simple craft, but sufficent to ride the friendly seas over the straight road. The work is complete, and as I run through the final checks I feel more than ever the siren-call of the waves."
 elven_racial.1001.cirdan.desc: "At last, my labour is at an end. Long I have tended this haven, dwelling by the grey shores until the Last Ship sails. My service has finally concluded, and I am at peace: free to sail west, free to leave this haven, and upon the waves on final time. [middleearth|E] no longer has need of me, and I may fufil my greatest desire."
 elven_racial.1001.amroth.desc: "Long I have dwelt by the sea, guarding this quiet haven. It has been a fruitful time, and I treasure the relationships I have built with those who habe passed through this haven. Fruitful too has been my partnership with the [dunedain|E] of [gondor|E], and I know I leave this site in trustworthy hands. Yet at last the time has come to depart at last, and leave this haven empty and silent, sailing West for better havens still."
 elven_racial.1001.edhellond.desc: "I have come to Edhellond, the haven of the Sindar. Founded by Falathrim fleeing the sack of Brithombar and Eglarest, it has long provided a safe haven in the southern lands. Quieter than Mithlond, Edhellond is almost more refuge than port, with many elves choosing to live here for years after first seeking the sea. My path leads me on past the near-silent city to the waterfront, where a small white ships sits at anchor ready to shepherd me over sea."
 elven_racial.1001.mithlond.desc: "As I come to the havens, [guide.GetName] comes forth to greet me. Very tall is he, his beard is long, and he is grey and old, save that his eyes are keen as stars. He looks at us and bows, leading us into the havens. There lies a white ship upon the quayside, stocked and prepared for our journey into the west."
 elven_racial.1001.a: "All is now ready"

 elven_racial.1002.t: "The Straight Road"
 elven_racial.1002.desc: "At last I go aboard, and the sails are drawn up, and the wind blows, and slowly the ship slips away down the long grey first. And the ship goes out into the High Sea and passes on into the West, until at last, on a night of rain, I smell a sweet fragrance on the air and hear the sound of singing coming over the water. And then it seems that the grey rain-curtain turns all to silven glass and is rolled back, and I behold white shores, and beyond them a far green country under a swift sunrise."
 elven_racial.1002.a: "At last!"

 elven_racial.1003.t: "Farewell Friends"
 elven_racial.1003.desc: "As I prepare to depart west, my heir [sad_heir.GetName] comes out to see me off. [sad_heir.GetHerHim] can hardly hold in the sorrow as I depart, but we know that this parting, however bittersweet, is not forever. [sad_heir.GetHerHim] too will someday take the Straight Road west to join me in [valinor|E].\n\nI turn my back on what has been my home for many yéni, and look afar at my long home across the sea. The sea-longing rises in me, and I am ready to be off at once."
 elven_racial.1003.a: "Farewell, friends! I hear the call."
 elven_racial.1003.b: "I have still too much to do!"
 elven_racial.1003.b.tt: "You return home"
