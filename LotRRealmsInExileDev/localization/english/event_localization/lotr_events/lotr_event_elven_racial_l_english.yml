For us, having a child is a conscious [decision|El], and we will only raise one at a time until they reach their [majority|El] at the age of 50.\n\nNone of our kind has married a child of [conceptracemen|E] since the legendary heroes of the Edain, in the [firstage|E], and none will do so again unless ordained by [eru|E].\n\nWe rule from [elven_refuges|E], and rarely do our armies leave our homes unless to reclaim our invaded homelands, to assist a neighbour beset by the forces of Evil, or to cleanse the lands of worshippers of [sauronthedarklordcharacter|E]."

 elven_racial.1000.a.desc: "For many years I have dwelt on this hither shore, and leaves have grown like the branching years. Yet ever there has been an unquiet in my heart, a longing unfufilled for my long home in the West. Now at last the time has come to act on that desire, leaving the sorrows and memories of [middleearth|E] for the promise of [valinor|E]."
 elven_racial.1000.cirdan.desc: "I have long tended the Grey Havens, but at last my watch has come to an end, and I am at liberty to depart on the Last Ship."
 elven_racial.1000.amroth.desc: "I haven long tended this haven of the [elves|E], and sent many a ship over water. Now at least my own time has come to depart myself and sail west from Cobas Haven."
 elven_racial.1000.edhellond.desc: "To the south lies Edhellond, haven of the Sindar upon the coasts of Gondor. There on the Bay of Belfalas I might acquire a ship to bear me across the sea."
 elven_racial.1000.mithlond.desc: "I might fare westward still to the Grey Havens, in the land of Lindon the long-guarded. They dwells Círdan the Shipwright, tending them until the Last Ship sails."

 elven_racial.1001.t: "The Havens"
 elven_racial.1001.desc: "Though many of my people sail west from one of our havens, not all depart from an established port. By chance or choice I have made my way to the shore, and here have I contructed my own ship. It is a simple craft, but sufficent to ride the friendly seas over the straight road. The work is complete, and as I run through the final checks I feel more than ever the siren-call of the waves."
 elven_racial.1001.cirdan.desc: "At last, my labour is at an end. Long I have tended this haven, dwelling by the grey shores until the Last Ship sails. My service has finally concluded, and I am at peace: free to sail west, free to leave this haven, and upon the waves on final time. [middleearth|E] no longer has need of me, and I may fufil my greatest desire."
 elven_racial.1001.amroth.desc: "Long I have dwelt by the sea, guarding this quiet haven. It has been a fruitful time, and I treasure the relationships I have built with those who habe passed through this haven. Fruitful too has been my partnership with the [dunedain|E] of [gondor|E], and I know I leave this site in trustworthy hands. Yet at last the time has come to depart at last, and leave this haven empty and silent, sailing West for better havens still."
 elven_racial.1001.edhellond.desc: "I have come to Edhellond, the haven of the Sindar. Founded by Falathrim fleeing the sack of Brithombar and Eglarest, it has long provided a safe haven in the southern lands. Quieter than Mithlond, Edhellond is almost more refuge than port, with many elves choosing to live here for years after first seeking the sea. My path leads me on past the near-silent city to the waterfront, where a small white ships sits at anchor ready to shepherd me over sea."
 elven_racial.1001.mithlond.desc: "As I come to the havens, [guide.GetName] comes forth to greet me. Very tall is he, his beard is long, and he is grey and old, save that his eyes are keen as stars. He looks at us and bows, leading us into the havens. There lies a white ship upon the quayside, stocked and prepared for our journey into the west."
 elven_racial.1001.a: "All is now ready"

 elven_racial.1002.t: "The Straight Road"
 elven_racial.1002.desc: "At last I go aboard, and the sails are drawn up, and the wind blows, and slowly the ship slips away down the long grey first. And the ship goes out into the High Sea and passes on into the West, until at last, on a night of rain, I smell a sweet fragrance on the air and hear the sound of singing coming over the water. And then it seems that the grey rain-curtain turns all to silven glass and is rolled back, and I behold white shores, and beyond them a far green country under a swift sunrise."
 elven_racial.1002.a: "At last!"
 sail_to_valinor: "You arrive in [valinor|E]"

 elven_racial.1003.t: "Farewell Friends"
 elven_racial.1003.desc: "As I prepare to depart west, my heir [sad_heir.GetName] comes out to see me off. [sad_heir.GetHerHim] can hardly hold in the sorrow as I depart, but we know that this parting, however bittersweet, is not forever. [sad_heir.GetHerHim] too will someday take the Straight Road west to join me in [valinor|E].\n\nI turn my back on what has been my home for many yéni, and look afar at my long home across the sea. The sea-longing rises in me, and I am ready to be off at once."
 elven_racial.1003.a: "Farewell, friends! I hear the call."
 elven_racial.1003.b: "I have still too much to do!"
 elven_racial.1003.b.tt: "You return home"
 
 ### Wander the Forests ###
 
 elven_racial.1201.t: "Wander the Forests: Setting Out"
 elven_racial.1201.desc: "The call of the forest beckons, and with a small retinue at my side, I set out toward the wooded depths of [destiny_forest_province.GetName]. The towering trees stand like ancient sentinels, their leaves rustling softly in the wind as though sharing their timeless wisdom.\n\nAs we walk, the world around us quiets, and a serene calm fills the air. There is no hurry, no burden — only the tranquil companionship of nature and the quiet solace found within its embrace."
 elven_racial.1201.a: "Let us depart."
 elven_racial.1201.a.tt: "You will travel to the woods in [destiny_forest_province.GetName]"
 
 elven_racial.1210.t: "Wander the Forests: A Wounded Stag"
 elven_racial.1210.desc: "As we venture through the woods of [destiny_forest_province.GetName], we come across a wounded stag, its once-proud frame now crumpled on the forest floor. The creature lies in agony, its breath shallow and laboured, the pain evident in every twitch of its body. Its eyes, though clouded with suffering, hold a quiet strength, as if resisting the inevitable.\n\nThe forest seems to mourn with it, the air heavy and still, as the struggle of life and death unfolds before us."
 elven_racial.1210.a: "Alas! All dear things shall pass."
 elven_racial.1210.b: "I must attempt to heal it."
 
 elven_racial.1211.t: "Wander the Forests: Starlight Beneath the Boughs"
 elven_racial.1211.desc: "As I wander the ancient forests of [destiny_forest_province.GetName], the whisper of the leaves seems to speak in a language older than time itself. Above, the stars pierce the canopy like the eyes of the Valar, their light filtering through the branches to touch me, cool and serene.\n\nEach beam feels like a blessing from Elbereth herself, a quiet reminder that even in the deepest shadows, the light of the stars will guide and protect. In this moment, I feel both small and infinite, a part of something eternal."
 elven_racial.1211.a: "Safe I am under Elbereth's lights."
 elven_racial.1211.b: "What wisdom do our dear stars betray?"
 
 elven_racial.1212.t: "Wander the Forests: The Young Sapling"
 elven_racial.1212.desc: "In a dark and dreary corner of the forest of [destiny_forest_province.GetName], where the trees stand tall and thick, casting long shadows over the ground, a single ray of light breaks through the canopy above. It illuminates a young sapling, its tender leaves trembling in the soft breeze.\n\nFor a brief moment, the surrounding gloom is pushed back, as if the very heart of the forest holds its breath in reverence. The sapling stands as a symbol of life's resilience, a glimmer of hope amidst the ancient and enduring trees."
 elven_racial.1212.a: "Even in the gloomiest parts of the forest, life is thriving."
 elven_racial.1212.b: "I shall tend to this youngling myself."

 elven_racial.1213.t: "Wander the Forests: A Glimpse of Rare Plumage"
 elven_racial.1213.desc: "In a quiet glade of the forest of [destiny_forest_province.GetName], a rare bird flits by, its bright plumage a fleeting wonder among the ancient trees. Its song is soft yet clear, a sound seldom heard even by those who know the woods well. For a brief moment, all the cares of the world seem to lift, carried away on the bird's gentle flight.\n\nSuch a sight is often taken as a good omen, a reminder that beauty and hope endure even in the most ancient of places."
 elven_racial.1213.a: "Even the oldest forests hold new promises."
 elven_racial.1213.b: "A sign of fair days yet to come."

 elven_racial.1214.t: "Wander the Forests: Drunken Revelry"
 elven_racial.1214.desc: "As I walk through the serene woods of [destiny_forest_province.GetName], the laughter of my kin reaches my ears long before I see them. A group of Elves, their steps unsteady and their faces flushed, stagger through the trees, singing songs in a lilting melody, far from their usual composed selves.\n\nThe air around them is thick with the scent of wine and carefree joy. They greet me with wide grins, offering me a cup, urging me to join their revelry."
 elven_racial.1214.a: "I'll join in the merriment."
 elven_racial.1214.b: "This is not how an Elf should behave."
 
 elven_racial.1215.t: "Wander the Forests: Solace of Varda"
 elven_racial.1215.desc: "As my entourage and I quietly pass through the peaceful glades and meadows of [destiny_forest_province.GetName], I find myself peering up at the sky more often than it is usual for me. Nightfall has set in, and beyond the green canopy above, the dearest lights know to the [elves|E] have appeared: [vardacharacter|E]'s stars.\n\nI fall silent. My ever-present sorrows relent for a moment as starlight shines upon my face.\n\n"After all that has happend, I am still here," I realize. "And I may yet have a part to play in this world.""
 elven_racial.1215.a: "As long as the stars yet shine, I will endure."
 elven_racial.1215.b: "I... I understand now... I must forge a new path."
 
 elven_racial.1216.t: "Wander the Forests: A Feast in the Woods"
 elven_racial.1216.desc: "Light trickles through the high emerald canopy of [destiny_forest_province.GetName], and mighty boughs shake in the breeze, upon which is carried birdsong. The tall trunks seem to bow at our coming. I take in a deep breath, and the air seems worthy of Taniquetil.\n\n"Bring forth the tables!"\n\nWith due haste my attendants bring forth tables and set them in the green glass, and then comes the food.\n\nFruits, ripe and plump, vibrant as jewels; mushrooms draped in savoury sauce; fresh and aromatic bread; platefuls succulent and flavourful vegetables; and silver bowls filled with some sort of steaming orange stew."
 elven_racial.1216.a: "I feel quite hungry"
 elven_racial.1216.a.tt: "You hold a banquet in the woods of [destiny_forest_province.GetName]"

 elven_racial.1217.t: "Wander the Forests: Merriment All Around"
 elven_racial.1217.desc: "We feast under the azure sky in [destiny_forest_province.GetName], the boughs of trees casting us in cool shade. The trilling of cicadas accompanies our merriment.\n\nThe food is almost as good as the surroundings. We eat heartily, drink cooled wine, and make merry. The bread is soft yet crispy, drizzled in oil; the mushrooms and vegetables are succulent and dazzlingly flavorful; the stew is hearty and smoky; and the fruits are as sweet as summer.\n\nSoon all that is left is crumbs and scraps. The company is cheerful, if a little lethargic, and I sit back and listen to the birdsong. True bliss is a full belly."
 elven_racial.1217.a: "A joyous gathering indeed!"
 
 elven_racial.1218.t: "Wander the Forests: A Banquet Disturbed"
 elven_racial.1218.desc: "We feast under the azure sky in [destiny_forest_province.GetName], the boughs of trees casting us in cool shade. The trilling of cicadas accompanies our merriment. And just as I feel a sense of grand relaxation coming over me, a rough voice interrupts the merriment.\n\n"S-sorry, good folk, but, we've gotten lost in this here forest, and... we're hungry and have lost our way," says [uninvited_traveler.GetName], leading a small group of ragged men right into our festive glade.\n\nElves all around gasp in shock. Within seconds, all eyes turn towards me, expecting a decison from me. Should we permit this intrusion? Or leave these interlopers behind?"
 elven_racial.1218.a: "Turn off the lights and retreat from this place."
 elven_racial.1218.b: "Very well.. they may share in our merriment."
 
 elven_racial.1219.t: "Wander the Forest: Accursed Foes"
 elven_racial.1219.desc: "Having entered the woods in [destiny_forest_province.GetName], it does not take long for my entourage to find disturbing tracks. The undergrowth has been trampled by iron-booted feet, and some trees have been hacked down.\n\n"Curse their foul lust for destruction!!" I utter, as a warning cry rings out from up ahead. The forest's defilers have been spotted: a roving band of [orcs|E]. My followers look to me, expecting a fast decision on what to do..."
 elven_racial.1219.a: "To arms! Leave none alive!"
 elven_racial.1219.a.success: "You slay the orcs"
 elven_racial.1219.a.failure: "You are wounded in the fighting"

 elven_racial.1220.desc: "My entourage and I have followed the forest paths in [destiny_forest_province.GetName] for quite a while now, and I've noticed a certain atmosphere of gloom overshadowing any merriment and song. Calling for a short rest at a secluded glade, I turn to adress the [elves|E] present.\n\nIf I am to inspire them and restore hope in their hearts, I must choose my words carefully. On the other hand, I could speak reassuring words to each of them, increasing my standing with them."
 elven_racial.1220.a: "I shall restore hope to the downtrodden."
 elven_racial.1220.b: "I will speak words of encouragement to my retainers."

 elven_racial.1221.t: "Wander the Forest: An Undisturbed Moment"
 elven_racial.1221.desc: "It has been a wonderful stroll through the vibrant forests of [destiny_forest_province.GetName]. Walking close to [elven_spouse.GetFirstName], my dear companion, I realize how much I am ejoying [elven_spouse.GetHerHis] company.\n\nI slow down my pace, allowing for our entourage to pass us by until only the two of us remain. Looking deep into [elven_spouse.GetFirstName]'s eyes, I can see the love I have for [elven_spouse.GetHerHim] reflected within.\n\nGently I embrace [elven_spouse.GetHerHim] and we stand in silence for a while, taking solace in each other's company."
 elven_racial.1221.a: "This is a special night, my dear, don't you think?"

 elven_racial.1222.t: "Wander the Forest: Gallant as Elf-lords"
 elven_racial.1222.desc: "While traversing the tranquil woods of [destiny_forest_province.GetName], we come to a small clearing under the light of noon's warm sun. My entourage begins to settle in for a small break from our wandering, but I feel restless and unable to sit.\n\nMy [marshal|E], [elven_marshal.GetName], approaches me. "My liege, would some exercise ease your troubled thoughts?" [elven_marshal.GetSheHe] suggests, offering me a blade."
 elven_racial.1222.a: "I've always enjoyed fighting beneath the trees."
 elven_racial.1222.b: "Very well then. Prepare yourself!"

 elven_racial.1299.desc: "My time wandering beneath the trees has come to an end. The matters of court and kin await my return, and the forest can no longer hold my attention... at least for now. It is time for me to return to my station in the realm."
