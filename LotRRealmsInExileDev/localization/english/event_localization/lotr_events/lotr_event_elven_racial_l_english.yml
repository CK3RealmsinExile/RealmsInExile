 elven_racial.1001.t: "The Havens"
 elven_racial.1001.desc: "Though many of my people sail west from one of our havens, not all depart from an established port. By chance or choice I have made my way to the shore, and here have I contructed my own ship. It is a simple craft, but sufficent to ride the friendly seas over the straight road. The work is complete, and as I run through the final checks I feel more than ever the siren-call of the waves."
 elven_racial.1001.cirdan.desc: "At last, my labour is at an end. Long I have tended this haven, dwelling by the grey shores until the Last Ship sails. My service has finally concluded, and I am at peace: free to sail west, free to leave this haven, and upon the waves one final time. [middleearth|E] no longer has need of me, and I may fufil my greatest desire."
 elven_racial.1001.amroth.desc: "Long I have dwelt by the sea, guarding this quiet haven. It has been a fruitful time, and I treasure the relationships I have built with those who have passed through this haven. Fruitful too has been my partnership with the [dunedain|E] of [gondor|E], and I know I leave this site in trustworthy hands. Yet the time has come to depart at last, and leave this haven empty and silent, sailing West for better havens still."
 elven_racial.1001.edhellond.desc: "I have come to Edhellond, the haven of the Sindar. Founded by Falathrim fleeing the sack of Brithombar and Eglarest, it has long provided a safe haven in the southern lands. \n\nQuieter than Mithlond, Edhellond is almost more refuge than port, with many elves choosing to live here for years after first seeking the sea. My path leads me on past the near-silent city to the waterfront, where a small white ship sits at anchor ready to shepherd me over sea."
 elven_racial.1001.mithlond.desc: "As I come to the havens, [guide.GetName] comes forth to greet me. Very tall is he, his beard is long, and he is grey and old, save that his eyes are keen as stars. He looks at us and bows, leading us into the havens. There lies a white ship upon the quayside, stocked and prepared for our journey into the west."

 elven_racial.1002.t: "The Straight Road"
 elven_racial.1002.desc: "At last I go aboard, and the sails are drawn up, and the wind blows, and slowly the ship slips away down the long grey first. And the ship goes out into the High Sea and passes on into the West, until at last, on a night of rain, I smell a sweet fragrance on the air and hear the sound of singing coming over the water.\n\nAnd then it seems that the grey rain-curtain turns all to silver glass and is rolled back, and I behold white shores, and beyond them a far green country under a swift sunrise."
 elven_racial.1002.a: "At last!"

 elven_racial.1003.t: "Farewell Friends"

[sad_heir.GetHerHim] can hardly hold in the sorrow as I depart, but we know that this parting, however bittersweet, is not forever. [sad_heir.GetName] too will someday take the Straight Road west to join me in [valinor|E].\n\nI turn my back on what has been my home for many yéni, and look afar at my long home across the sea. The sea-longing rises in me, and I am ready to be off at once."
 elven_racial.1003.a: "Farewell, friends! I hear the call."

 elven_racial.1004.t: "[elf_trying_to_depart.GetFirstName]: The Call of the Sea"
 elven_racial.1004.desc: "Troubling news reaches my ears of [elf_trying_to_depart.GetName]'s plans of sailing into the Undying Lands of [valinor|E]. While all [elves|E] are free to depart to the havens whenever they become weary of [middleearth|E], every elf that leaves these shores lessens the strength of our people who yet linger here and dare to defy the darkness.\n\nShould I attempt to persuade [elf_trying_to_depart.GetFirstName] from their journey and convince [elf_trying_to_depart.GetHerHim] to stay?"
 elven_racial.1004.a: "There is hope yet in [middleearth|E]. Stay, [elf_trying_to_depart.GetFirstName]."

 elven_racial.1201.desc: "The call of the forest beckons, and with a small retinue at my side, I set out toward the wooded depths of [destiny_forest_province.GetName]. The towering trees stand like ancient sentinels, their leaves rustling softly in the wind as though sharing their timeless wisdom.\n\nAs we walk, the world around us quiets, and a serene calm fills the air. There is no hurry, no burden — only the tranquil companionship of nature and the quiet solace found within its embrace."

 elven_racial.1210.t: "Wander the Forests: A Wounded Stag"
 elven_racial.1210.desc: "As we venture through the woods of [destiny_forest_province.GetName], we come across a wounded stag, its once-proud frame now crumpled on the forest floor. The creature lies in agony, its breath shallow and laboured, the pain evident in every twitch of its body. Its eyes, though clouded with suffering, hold a quiet strength, as if resisting the inevitable.\n\nThe forest seems to mourn with it, the air heavy and still, as the struggle of life and death unfolds before us."
 elven_racial.1210.a: "Alas! All dear things shall pass."
 elven_racial.1210.b: "I must attempt to heal it."
 
 elven_racial.1211.t: "Wander the Forests: Starlight Beneath the Boughs"
 elven_racial.1211.desc: "As I wander the ancient forests of [destiny_forest_province.GetName], the whisper of the leaves seems to speak in a language older than time itself. Above, the stars pierce the canopy like the eyes of the Valar, their light filtering through the branches to touch me, cool and serene.\n\nEach beam feels like a blessing from Elbereth herself, a quiet reminder that even in the deepest shadows, the light of the stars will guide and protect. In this moment, I feel both small and infinite, a part of something eternal."
 elven_racial.1211.a: "Safe I am under Elbereth's lights."
 elven_racial.1211.b: "What wisdom do our dear stars betray?"
 
 elven_racial.1212.t: "Wander the Forests: The Young Sapling"
 elven_racial.1212.desc: "In a dark and dreary corner of the forest of [destiny_forest_province.GetName], where the trees stand tall and thick, casting long shadows over the ground, a single ray of light breaks through the canopy above. It illuminates a young sapling, its tender leaves trembling in the soft breeze.\n\nFor a brief moment, the surrounding gloom is pushed back, as if the very heart of the forest holds its breath in reverence. The sapling stands as a symbol of life's resilience, a glimmer of hope amidst the ancient and enduring trees."
 elven_racial.1212.a: "Even in the gloomiest parts of the forest, life is thriving."

 elven_racial.1213.desc: "In a quiet glade of the forest of [destiny_forest_province.GetName], a rare bird flits by, its bright plumage a fleeting wonder among the ancient trees. Its song is soft yet clear, a sound seldom heard even by those who know the woods well. For a brief moment, all the cares of the world seem to lift, carried away on the bird's gentle flight.\n\nSuch a sight is often taken as a good omen, a reminder that beauty and hope endure even in the most ancient of places."

 elven_racial.1213.b: "A sign of fair days yet to come."

 elven_racial.1214.t: "Wander the Forests: Drunken Revelry"
 elven_racial.1214.desc: "As I walk through the serene woods of [destiny_forest_province.GetName], the laughter of my kin reaches my ears long before I see them. A group of Elves, their steps unsteady and their faces flushed, stagger through the trees, singing songs in a lilting melody, far from their usual composed selves.\n\nThe air around them is thick with the scent of wine and carefree joy. They greet me with wide grins, offering me a cup, urging me to join their revelry."
 elven_racial.1214.a: "I'll join in the merriment."
 elven_racial.1214.b: "This is not how an Elf should behave."
 
 elven_racial.1215.t: "Wander the Forests: Solace of Varda"
 elven_racial.1215.desc: "As my entourage and I quietly pass through the peaceful glades and meadows of [destiny_forest_province.GetName], I find myself peering up at the sky more often than it is usual for me. Nightfall has set in, and beyond the green canopy above, the dearest lights know to the [elves|E] have appeared: [vardacharacter|E]'s stars.\n\nI fall silent. My ever-present sorrows relent for a moment as starlight shines upon my face.\n\n"After all that has happened, I am still here," I realize. "And I may yet have a part to play in this world.""

The tall trunks seem to bow at our coming. I take in a deep breath, and the air seems worthy of Taniquetil.\n\n"Bring forth the tables!"\n\nWith due haste my attendants bring forth tables and set them in the green glass, and then comes the food.\n\nFruits, ripe and plump, vibrant as jewels; mushrooms draped in savoury sauce; fresh and aromatic bread; platefuls succulent and flavourful vegetables; and silver bowls filled with some sort of steaming orange stew."

 elven_racial.1217.desc: "We feast under the azure sky in [destiny_forest_province.GetName], the boughs of trees casting us in cool shade. The trilling of cicadas accompanies our merriment.\n\nThe food is almost as good as the surroundings. We eat heartily, drink cooled wine, and make merry. The bread is soft yet crispy, drizzled in oil; the mushrooms and vegetables are succulent and dazzlingly flavorful; the stew is hearty and smoky; and the fruits are as sweet as summer.\n\nSoon all that is left is crumbs and scraps. The company is cheerful, if a little lethargic, and I sit back and listen to the birdsong. True bliss is a full belly."

 elven_racial.1218.t: "Wander the Forests: A Banquet Disturbed"
 elven_racial.1218.desc: "We feast under the azure sky in [destiny_forest_province.GetName], the boughs of trees casting us in cool shade. The trilling of cicadas accompanies our merriment. And just as I feel a sense of grand relaxation coming over me, a rough voice interrupts the merriment.\n\n"S-sorry, good folk, but, we've gotten lost in this here forest, and... we're hungry and have lost our way," says [uninvited_traveler.GetName], leading a small group of ragged men right into our festive glade.\n\nElves all around gasp in shock. Within seconds, all eyes turn towards me, expecting a decison from me. Should we permit this intrusion? Or leave these interlopers behind?"

The undergrowth has been trampled by iron-booted feet, and some trees have been hacked down.\n\n"Curse their foul lust for destruction!!" I utter, as a warning cry rings out from up ahead. The forest's defilers have been spotted: a roving band of [orcs|E]. My followers look to me, expecting a fast decision on what to do..."

Calling for a short rest at a secluded glade, I turn to address the [elves|E] present.\n\nIf I am to inspire them and restore hope in their hearts, I must choose my words carefully. On the other hand, I could speak reassuring words to each of them, increasing my standing with them."

The style is unmistakably Elven — delicate, elegant, and heartbreakingly old.\n\nI trace faded carvings with my fingers, their meanings obscured by time. Ancient columns lie broken among the roots, and weather-worn statues gaze silently through tangled undergrowth. It is said that many such places were abandoned when the Firstborn withdrew into the West.\n\nPerhaps this was once a hall of music, or a sanctuary of lore. Standing among its crumbling grace, I can almost hear voices in the wind—singing, laughing, grieving."

Yet the marchwardens are uneasy, fearing that our sudden appearance may cause alarm or draw unwanted attention to our own realm. I study the village a moment longer.

Their numbers are too many for a direct strike, but the camp itself is a mess of carelessness. Ropes hang loose, weapons lie unattended, and their supplies sit piled out in the open, unguarded.\n\nA quiet certainty settles over me. We must act swiftly and unseen.

There is no fear in their posture, only curiosity and a calm acknowledgment, as though our meeting were simply another thread in the tapestry of the road. I offer a short greeting, and the wanderer returns it with a gentle inclination of the head.\n\nI sense no shadows between us, only the quiet resilience of one who has walked long miles alone. Perhaps they bear news from distant havens, or perhaps they simply travel where memory leads them. Whatever the reason, this meeting feels like a welcome blessing on our watch."

Whatever drove these people away, it did so quietly, leaving behind an emptiness that hums in the still air.\n\nA weight settles on my chest as I pause at the center of the village.

The stream runs clear and cold, offering an easy source of water. Game trails weave nearby without pressing too close. As I walk the perimeter, I can almost sense the echo of what could be; a watchfire burning steady, tents nestled beneath boughs, a haven for those who guard these borders.\n\nI pause at the crest of the rise, taking in the view: the wilderness stretching calm and uninterrupted in every direction.

Instead, their leader steps forward, hands open at [trespasser_leader.GetHerHis] sides, a quiet plea in [trespasser_leader.GetHerHis] eyes.\n\nI feel the shift in my patrol behind me, a ripple of caution tempered by curiosity. Mortals seldom come this close without cause. Their wagons carry no weapons, no banners, only the modest belongings of families on the road. Some cradle children; others lean on walking sticks worn smooth. It's clear that they seek passage into our lands, a safe haven from troubles they cannot outrun. Their reasons are earnest, yet the borders we guard are not easily opened, even to those in need.\n\nDo we turn them away gently, as is our custom? Do we insist they depart at once if words fail?
