Those were mighty times for the lands of Enedhwaith, when a Dunlending-Gondorian house held Isengard and on the throne of Rohan sat a Dunlending-Rohirrim king, Wulf, son of Freca.\n\nSince then, a handful of adventurous Umbarians have sailed round the Cape of Andrast and journeyed to and from [capital_province.GetName] and the nearby lands, whether as merchants, adventurers, or exiles.\n\nToday, one such person, [lotr_spawned_courtier.GetTitledFirstName], has arrived at my court, offering their services.
