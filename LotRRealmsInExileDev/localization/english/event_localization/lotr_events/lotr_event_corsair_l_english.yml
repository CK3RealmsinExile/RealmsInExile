 ### CORSAIR COURTIER EVENTS ###
 lotr_courtier_spawn.0001.t:0 "The Corsair from Umbar"
 lotr_courtier_spawn.0001.desc:0 "In the times of King Helm of Rohan and Freca of the Adorn and Dunland the Corsairs of Umbar sailed up the Gwathló River and made alliance with the Dunlendings in their war against Rohan. Those were mighty times for the lands of Enedhwaith, when a Dunlending-Gondorian house held Isengard and on the throne of Rohan sat a Dunlending-Rohirrim king, Wulf, son of Freca.\n\nSince then, a handful of adventurous Umbarians have sailed round the cape of Andrast and journeyed to and from [capital_province.GetName] and the nearby lands, whether as merchants, adventurers, or exiles.\n\nToday, one such person, [lotr_spawned_courtier.GetTitledFirstName] has arrived at my court, offering their services.

[lotr_spawned_courtier.GetTitledFirstName] has arrived in my court, offering their services. They claim to have connections with powerful people in a Dúnedain princedom that may prove useful to us.

They claim to have connections with powerful people in Rhovanion that may prove useful to us.\n\nThey speak: “Perhaps I can offer you more than my services. Half of my Éored is yours if you can best me in a horse race around the walls of your castle.”"

 ### Aglarin introduction event ###
 mardruak.0100.t:0 "Ghosts of the Belegaer"
 mardruak.0100.desc:0 "Narik-Zadan was once the most ancient [numenorean|E] port in Mardruak. Yet long has it been since the great vessels of Westernesse sought this haven. In the centuries since the Downfall the coves of Mardruak have become dread harbors of the Corsairs, fierce sea-raiders who make their living from sack, pillage, and piracy. \n\nIn recent decades the corsairs of Mardruak were united under Belphêgor, a Mardrukan pirate so renowned and feared up and down the coast that he came to be known as the "Ghost of the [belegaer_sea|E]", and forged a new kingdom free from the influence [umbar|E] and [bellakar|E].\n\nAs he felt the moment of death approaching, he gave all of his children their own command, including his favoured daughter, Aglarin. Yet on his death tradition prevailed and Belphêgor’s unworthy eldest son Gôdrathor sat on the pirate throne. After two years of intrusive inspections and high-handed appropriation, Gôdrathor’s siblings rose against his unfair rule and brought his reign to an end.\n\nThe scions of Belphêgor are now captains of their own ships, and commanders of their own havens. Fiercest and most cunning is Aglarin, who rules Narik-Zadan through both fear and favour. But will she be content to remain potentate of a short stretch of coastland, or will her ambition drive her to seek her father’s throne for herself?"
