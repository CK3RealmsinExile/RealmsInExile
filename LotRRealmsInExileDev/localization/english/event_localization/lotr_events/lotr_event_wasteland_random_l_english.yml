 colonisation_random.0001.t: "[colony_province.GetName]: The Squirrel"
 colonisation_random.0001.desc: "While journeying to visit my colony of [colony_province.GetName], my company and I pause for a light repast among the trees. I find myself lost in thought, mulling over the most recent challenges faced by my realm. Suddenly my reverie is broken by a rustling in the boughs above. In the gloom it takes a moment before I can identify the source of the sound - a sleek black squirrel.\n\nIt stares at me. I stare back. Something in its beady gaze strikes me as malevolent. I realise that my men are watching this stand-off with interest, and so decide to take the opportunity to demonstrate my prowess. Slowly, I reach out and grasp a pine cone that lies near my feet. With a flash I throw it at the squirrel. Then, to my horror, the squirrel easily dodges the cone and launches itself shrieking at my face!"

 colonisation_random.0002.desc: "I scout the tangled woodland paths near my colony of [colony_province.GetName], marvelling at the sheer density of the ancient forest. In places trees grow almost trunk-to-trunk. Fallen deadwood sprouts luminous mushrooms. Living trees are strewn with vine and creepers, and shrouded in spongy mosses and trailing lichens. The air is pungent with a thousand scents of vibrant life and foetid decay.\n\nSuddenly I see it. Caught in a shaft of light breaking through the canopy like a heavenly spear: a huge deer, ice-white, with amber eyes which fix on me for a moment.\n\nThen, with a snorting exhalation, the white hart springs away down the path. I can hear the sound of my company drawing their bows behind me."

At last there are signs of life, and green grasses have begun to spring up where once there was only barren earth.\n\nYet progress is slow, and it is evident that the colony will need to be supplied with food and fodder for many years to come, at great expense.

 colonisation_random.2010.t: "[colony_province.GetName]: Lupine Threat"
 colonisation_random.2010.desc: "With the influx of settlers in [colony_province.GetName], comes the arrival of their various grazing herds - sheep, primarily, but others as well. However, this migration of free-range herds seems to have also attracted other newcomers...\n\nWith the abundance of new and relatively unguarded prey, wolves have begun to appear in greater numbers in the province.\n\nWhile they have not yet harmed any settlers, we continue to receive complaints about the loss of their animals, and with it, their economic livelihood and valuable food source.\n\nI will need to address this issue soon or risk the faltering of my new colony."
 colonisation_random.2010.a: "Damned wolves!"

 colonisation_random.2011.t: "[colony_province.GetName]: Bandit Country"
 colonisation_random.2011.desc: "In the rugged outlands of [colony_province.GetName], the authority of my rule is weak at best. Our infrastructure is minimal, and primarily devoted to keeping the colony afloat. As a result, those of disrepute often find their way there under false names, avoiding justice and the consequences for their previous ill-deeds.\n\nThese self-proclaimed 'free men', who live wild and free, answerable to none, might sound romantic and even attractive, but it is largely a mirage, covering up dastardly deeds and cruel acts.\n\nThe frontier all too often becomes a haven of brigands and bandits, and so too has it come to be here."
 colonisation_random.2011.a: "Those good-for-nothin' brigands!"

 colonisation_random.2012.desc: "It has been some time since the settlement in [colony_province.GetName] has first been established. The initial reports from the colony have been positive, and the work has progressed without problems.\n\nThe next report from the settlement is delivered by [colonist.GetFirstName], who has been selected as the colonists' representative. "My [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip], my fellow settlers and I come before you with a plea of autonomy," [colonist.GetSheHe] states - to my surprise. "We've worked hard and reached our goals way ahead of schedule - such diligence deserves a reward, wouldn't you agree?"\n\nIt is a bold request indeed to ask for quasi-independence for the colony that I funded. On the other hand, granting their request might lead to mutual benefits..."

 colonisation_random.2012.a: "Aye. Pay your tribute to me, and you may govern yourselves."

 colonisation_random.2013.desc: "Grim news reaches me from the settlement in [colony_province.GetName]. Scattered bands of marauding [orcs|E] have been sighted near the province's borders, and there have been reports of sporadic raids.\n\nThose beasts will surely grow to present a grave threat to the settlement if they are not driven out or dealt with.\n\nIt is clear to me that I must act with haste to handle this setback in order to prevent further unpleasant surprises..."
 colonisation_random.2013.a: "We must deal with those savages!"

 colonisation_random.2014.desc: "The latest progress reports from the settlement in [colony_province.GetName] have arrived. As I begin to review them, it becomes clear that the workers have been making an astonishing amount of progress, and have in fact finished building up the colony very far ahead of schedule!\n\nThis means that the holding in [colony_province.GetName] has been completed through a combination of luck and lack of interruptions from the surrounding wilderness.\n\nA great day indeed for [ROOT.Char.GetPrimaryTitle.GetName]!"

Workers from the settlement have gone missing, and investigations into the surrounding countryside have revealed the presence of many giant spiders!\n\nIf these beasts are not culled, they will continue to hinder much of the progress of building up the local settlement. It is obvious that something must be done sooner rather than later."
 colonisation_random.2015.a: "Ugh. I hate spiders..."

 colonisation_random.2016.t: "[colony_province.GetName]: Rise of the Heretics"
 colonisation_random.2016.desc: "A sealed letter reaches me from the settlement in [colony_province.GetName]. It was sent by [heretic_colonist.GetFirstName], one of the local leaders. Apparently, the settlement has been completed faster than expected, but the workers have started to follow the faith of [heretical_faith.GetName]!\n\nWhile I should be pleased at the unexpected progress from the settlement, this divergence in faith is a matter that I cannot leave unadressed. Should this heresy be allowed to continue, or do I need to stamp it out as soon as possible?"
 colonisation_random.2016.tt: "The colony in [colony_province.GetName] was completed"
 colonisation_random.2016.a: "They have done well. I shall permit their heresy."
