 colonisation_random.0001.desc:0 "While journeying to visit my colony of [colony_province.GetName], my company and I pause for a light repast among the trees. I find myself lost in thought, mulling over the most recent challenges faced by my realm. Suddenly my reverie is broken by a rustling in the boughs above. In the gloom it takes a moment before I can identify the source of the sound - a sleek black squirrel.\n\nIt stares at me. I stare back. Something in its beady gaze strikes me as malevolent. I realise that my men are watching this stand-off with interest, and so decide to take the opportunity to demonstrate my prowess. Slowly, I reach out and grasp a pine cone that lies near my feet. With a flash I throw it at the squirrel. Then, to my horror, the squirrel easily dodges the cone and launches itself shrieking at my face!"

The air is pungent with a thousand scents of vibrant life and foetid decay.\n\nSuddenly I see it. Caught in a shaft of light breaking through the canopy like a heavenly spear: a huge deer, ice-white, with amber eyes which fix on me for a moment.\n\nThen, with a snorting exhalation, the white hart springs away down the path.

 colonisation_random.2010.t:0 "[colony_province.GetName]: Lupine Threat"
 colonisation_random.2010.desc:0 "With the influx of settlers in [colony_province.GetName], comes the arrival of their various grazing herds - sheep, primarily, but others as well. However, this migration of free-range herds seems to have also attracted other newcomers...\n\nWith the abundance of new and relatively unguarded prey, wolves have begun to appear in greater numbers in the province.\n\nWhile they have not yet harmed any settlers, we continue to receive complaints about the loss of their animals, and with it, their economic livelihood and valuable food source.\n\nI will need to address this issue soon or risk the faltering of my new colony."

 colonisation_random.2011.t:0 "[colony_province.GetName]: Bandit Country"
 colonisation_random.2011.desc:0 "In the rugged outlands of [colony_province.GetName], the authority of my rule is weak at best. Our infrastructure is minimal, and primarily devoted to keeping the colony afloat. As a result, those of disrepute often find their way there under false names, avoiding justice and the consequences for their previous ill-deeds.\n\nThese self-proclaimed 'free men', who live wild and free, answerable to none, might sound romantic and even attractive, but it is largely a mirage, covering up dastardly deeds and cruel acts.\n\nThe frontier all too often becomes a haven of brigands and bandits, and so too has it come to be here."
