  ### Tedjin Civil War Events ###
 tedjin.0101.t: "The Confederation in Crisis"
 tedjin.0101.desc: "For the past 50 years, Ayal of the House of Thezij has judiciously balanced the powers both external and internal within the Tedjin Confederacy. His long-standing friendship with the house of Azumen has ensured internal support and stability for his long reign, cemented by the marriage of his son and heir to their eldest daughter. \n\nIn foreign affairs, he has championed a cautious and judicious policy. Under his reign, few great battles have been fought, but Tedjin mercenaries have fought far afield, bringing glory and fame to their houses. Now though, in the twilight of his years, it all threatens to unravel. His son and heir, Bór, returned from his battles abroad shaken in his convictions of his people and their ways. Converting to the Batan-an-Izindi, his son is now seized by a fierce desire to reform their people, and to abandon their old ways. \n\nThis has roused the ire of the conservatives of the confederation. Now in the last embers of his days, Ayal can only watch in horror as all the plans of his generation to ensure lasting stability turn to ash..."
 tedjin.0101.a: "I don't have enough time anymore..."
 
 tedjin.0102.t: "A Son's Tribute"
 tedjin.0102.desc: "Father, rest well. Many years you shepherded our people, calm and sage. You always sought to ensure tranquility among them, but tranquility can no longer be enough.\n\nOur people live as mere hired arms for greater realms, our honor and pride degraded! We must alter our course and set right our path, if we are to rise once more as a people proud and free.\n\nMy dream is the inheritance of our family, nay our people. I shall lead us down the path you could not. Rest well, Ayal, great peacekeeper - I shall carry our torch from here."
 tedjin.0102.a: "Now where to begin?"
 
 tedjin.0103.t: "The Unexpected Heir"
 tedjin.0103.desc: "I never expected to inherit rule so soon! Father was young when he died, and I thought I had many more years before thoughts of lordship would have to be contemplated.\n\nMy father always spoke so passionately about his dream - I cannot allow it to die with him.\n\nBut, for all my love of him, he was rash, and rather blunt at times. Reform can come, if I want it, but I must proceed carefully from here on out..."
 tedjin.0103.a: "In time I shall bring them to heel."
 tedjin.0103.b: "Though it pains me, I must relent."
 tedjin.0103.c: "Why waste time swaying those who cannot be?"
 
 tedjin.0105.t: "The Confederacy Splits!"
 tedjin.0105.desc: "In the face of the continued defiance of conservative lords, [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetTitledFirstName] has formally absolved them of their oaths of loyalty to [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetHerHim], and bid them to elect one of their own number to lead their own realm.\n\n[ROOT.GetCharacter.GetTitledFirstName] has taken those who agree with [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetHerHis] reforms, religious and political, and created a new kingdom: Sôriya.\n\nThough smaller than the Tedjin Confederacy, it is assuredly more stable. Time shall tell what happens between this new kingdom and its neighbours..."
 tedjin.0105.a: "Good riddance! Let them have their backwards ways..."
 tedjin.0105.b: "Is he allowed to do that?"
 
 tedjin.0106.t: "The Child Lord"
 tedjin.0106.desc: "The ascension of a child-lord has rocked the confederacy. With [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetTitledFirstName] still well below the age of majority, the regional confederation lords have already begun to jockey for power, refusing to swear their oaths of loyalty on account of [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetHerHis] family's recent conversion to the Batan an-Izindi.\n\nWhile they still hold power in Thri Zirakan and the local areas there, the dynasty's ability to enforce unity across the confederacy has dwindled down to nothing. For all intents and purposes, the Tedjin Confederacy has been dissolved. "
 tedjin.0106.a: "Make the mean men go away!"
 
 tedjin.0107.t: "The Last of House Thezij"
 tedjin.0107.desc: "Tarika, Daughter of Ayal, never expected to rule over the Tedjin. Now one of the last of her line, her sons shall not bear that name - it is the end of an era.\n\nThe ascension of Ayal's daughter has brought a return to the conservative and pragmatic policy of his days. However, the lords of Kes Ebb have refused to acknowledge the return to the old status quo, and did not journey to swear fealty to her!\n\nInstead, they have turned South and sought the protection of Felaya. While many of the confederacy lords fume at this insult, it also seems unlikely they shall yet be able to bring vengeance upon the perfidious lords at this time..."
 tedjin.0107.a: "Why did this have to fall to me?"
 
 tedjin.0108.t: "The Death of Ayal"
 tedjin.0108.desc: "Ayal has taken his last breath, and now the confederacy is led by [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetTitledFirstName]. Likely this will bring a return to traditional Tedjin mores and policy.\n\nIn response, the reformist lords of Kes Ebb have seceded from the Confederacy, and bent the knee to Felaya instead. Time shall tell what will come from this change."
 tedjin.0108.a: "A return to normal, I guess..."
 
 tedjin.0109.t: "The Pyre of the Peaceful"
 tedjin.0109.desc: "May you rest in peace, my dear father. I do not know what will come now, but I shall rule as you taught me - strong and true to our traditions, which has seen our family through countless years and trials. I feel it in my heart that the peace you so assiduously sought to preserve shall not last long, now. But tonight is for you, and the past, not the future.\n\nWhatever trials await me when the sun rises again, I shall meet them as a true Lord of the house of Azumen - but for now, I shall sit here, and honor my father, as my father did before me."
 tedjin.0109.a: "By the fire of Maladum, be delivered to his halls."

 tedjin.0111.t: "A Wife's Plea"
 tedjin.0111.desc: "Bulga, my wife and the sister of my former friend Azumen, has begged me to allow her to go and speak with her brother. She seems convinced that she can help him see the folly of his ways and avert disaster before our realm tears itself in two.\n\nHer naive optimism is sweet, but I know that stubborn keffel will never relent. And yet, in these dark times maybe the One will illuminate the true path for him to follow.\n\nI really do not see what good it will do... "
 tedjin.0111.a: "...but she can try."
 tedjin.0111.a.tt: "Bulga will travel to meet her brother and beg him to reconsider his position."
 
 tedjin.0112.t: "A Sister's Plea"
 tedjin.0112.desc: "Bulga, my sister and wife of my once-friend Bór, has come and begged me to relent my feud with her husband.\n\nShe implores me to remember the friendship we once had, and what great things we and our people could accomplish united behind Bór's vision. What say I?"
 tedjin.0112.a: "Maladûm knows no compromise!"
 tedjin.0112.a.tt: "#V You outright oppose Bór and his reformists, setting the realm on course for civil war.#!"
 tedjin.0112.b: "For my sister alone, I will relent."

 tedjin.0113.t: "The Hardliner Softens"
 tedjin.0113.desc: "Azumen, one of the Confederacy's strongest Katajans and long seen as leader of the conservative faction resisting Bór's reformist ideals, has given up his traditional Maladûmite faith and reconciled with his former friend and new Lord.\n\nWith this unexpected development, conservative opposition to Bór's reforms has weakened significantly with many other conservative lords forced under pressure to reconsider their position."
 tedjin.0113.a: "Finally, they begin to understand my vision."
 tedjin.0113.b: "Times change, but family is forever..."
 tedjin.0113.c: "That was a close call!"
 tedjin.0113.d: "Maladûm knows no compromise!"
 tedjin.0113.e: "Our cause is lost, I must move on."

 tedjin.0114.t: "Crossroads of Destiny"
 tedjin.0114.desc: "My wife has returned to my court in a dejected state. As expected, it appears that her plea for Azumen to reconcile with me has fallen on deaf ears. Now she is full of worry for the fate of her brother and begs me to avoid any confrontation.\n\nAnd yet now, with the steadfast emnity of the house of Azumen assured, conservatives will rally behind him to oppose my reforms and the will of the One.\n\nI shall have to consider carefully how to proceed..."
 tedjin.0114.a: "There is but one path to our people's future!"
 tedjin.0114.a.tt: "#V You outright oppose Azumen and his reactionaries, setting the realm on course for civil war.#!"
 tedjin.0114.a.tt2: "#V Success in the civil war will unlock the powerful Tedjin Invasion Casus Belli.#!"
 tedjin.0114.b: "I shall learn from my father's example - compromise is key."
 tedjin.0114.b.tt: "#V You take the long route, slowly making the changes you want to see, surrounded by those that oppose you.#!"
 tedjin.0114.c: "The Confederacy is not ready for change."
 tedjin.0114.c.tt: "#V You abandon all hope of reform in your realm and return to the traditional ways of your people.#!"
 tedjin.0114.d: "Obstinate fools! I shall lead the wise to a new path, apart from them."
 tedjin.0114.d.tt: "#V You secede from the Confederacy, leaving Azumen to rule the North while you work towards building a new nation along the coast.#!"
 
 tedjin.0115.t: "The Tedjin Dispute"
 tedjin.0115.desc: "The Tedjin Confederacy is roiling with unrest, as the ambitious new Kataj Bór seeks to push forward political and religious reforms. In response, the more conservative lords of the confederacy have begun to covertly resist Bór's efforts at every turn. In fact, there are significant signs that it may erupt into full civil strife.\n\nWhile we might quickly dismiss the internal squabbles of desert tribesmen, the Tedjin are renowned fighters and mercenaries, and occupy a vital buffer between Umbar and Bellakar. Should the reactionary lords succeed in overthrowing Bór, their ambitions will surely turn South once more.\n\nAs such, it might be wise to attempt to ensure the faction aligned with our interests succeeds in this struggle..."
 tedjin.0115.a: "Perhaps we should intervene to keep them from our doorstep..."
 tedjin.0115.b: "With my support, perhaps they could harass my enemies in the South."
 tedjin.0115.tt: "Tedjin Civil War support decision unlocked."
 
 tedjin.0116.t: "A Bargain for the Tedjin"
 tedjin.0116.desc: "Little escapes the notice of Sauron the Great. Word has reached your ears of unrest stirring in the lands of the Tedjin Confederacy, the once-mercenaries who served you in the Last Alliance.\n\nOf the two factions, the one to support is obvious. The reactionaries are fierce warriors, and if victorious, would be a knife aimed at the realm of Bellakar - not a principle threat, but one to be brought to heel regardless..."
 tedjin.0116.a: "I shall offer them my support."
 tedjin.0116.b: "I will offer them much support if they shall acknowledge my lordship..."
 tedjin.0116.c: "I have more important things to focus on than their pathetic squabbling."
 tedjin.0116.tt: "If successful in their civil war, they will become your [tributary_state|E]."
 
 tedjin.0117.t: "The Messenger from Mordor"
 tedjin.0117.desc: "As the sun dips in the west and the shadows lengthen, a cloaked messenger, veiled beneath a dark hood, arrives at my court. \n\n"Oh [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetTitledFirstName], most noble lord, my master Sauron the Great wishes fortune and prosperity upon thee. How ignoble the way that your traditions are trampled upon, the injustice of your oppression! My lord remembers well the valiance of thy people, and would not see them shackled by weak lords. Word has come to us of your need, and my lord wishes to offer thee aid!"\n\nAnd so, the offer hangs in the air - the Lord of Mordor has offered us many forces with which to fight, asking only that we remember the favor he has done for us..."
 tedjin.0117.a: "Sauron understands our plight, we accept his aid!"

Word has come to us of your need, and my lord wishes to offer thee aid... for a price."\n\nAnd so, the offer hangs in the air - the Lord of Mordor has offered us many forces with which to fight, but it comes with strings attracted..."

 tedjin.0119.t: "An Ally in the Western Waste?"
 tedjin.0119.desc: "In our quest to re-assert our hegemony in Harwen, it would be wise to seek friends abroad. The Tedjin are currently undergoing severe unrest which will assuredly turn into civil strife - the reactionaries would make valuable allies. We could make them indebted to us if we aided their rebellion..."
 tedjin.0119.a: "Let us send a small force."
 tedjin.0119.b: "Let us send a large host."

It almost seems too good to be true..."

 tedjin.0121.b: "What's the catch...?"
 
 tedjin.0122.t: "Proactive Diplomacy"
 tedjin.0122.desc: "For years, the Tedjin have been both friend and foe. They have served us well as mercenaries, but have also raided our countryside and killed our people.\n\nNow, a great strife has begun among them between two competing factions. If we were to aid the reactionaries, we could align them with ourselves, securing our southern border."
 tedjin.0122.a: "Let us send a small force."

That looks like it might be about to change, if the growing reactionary faction wins in the brewing civil strife.\n\nI have received whispered reports that the ambition of these conservative reactionaries is to restore the ancient Kajarate of Qadjajar.

 tedjin.0128.desc: "The Tedjin Confederacy, our erstwhile neighbour, is showing signs of increasing instability ever since the ascension of Bor to the position of Kataj. His religious policies have been most pleasing to my court, and the prospect of a friendlier neighbour is a good one. However, such promising signs might come to nothing if he is overthrown but a short while into his reign!\n\nAfter taking council, many of the lords of Felaya believe it would be prudent to offer him aid against those revolting against his rule.  Some of the more militant of them argue that the return of long-lost Kes Ebb should be a condition for our aid, but that if so, we should be generous. What does the First Lord bid?"
 tedjin.0128.a: "Let us send a small force to aid the reformist Kataj."
 tedjin.0128.b: "Let us send a sizeable force."
 tedjin.0128.c: "Send an emissary with an offer for a mighty army in exchange for Kes Ebb's return."

 tedjin.0131.desc: "Keeping an eye on the brewing instability, an emissary of the First Lord of Felaya has arrived at your court. Speaking of their sympathies for your attempt to spread enlightenment throughout your people, they come bearing a proposal mediated by the Izinidubeth himself.\n\nFor many years, Felaya has yearned for the return of the lost lands of Kes Ebb. Should you be willing to return these sundered lands to her, Felaya will gladly send many men and commanders to fight to ensure the House of Thezij stands triumphant in the brewing storm."

 tedjin.0132.desc: "While thankful for my kind thoughts and generous offer, the Kataj of the Tedjin says that he cannot abandon a vassal without appearing weak and inciting further questions of his legitimacy.\n\nMy council is now in debate over whether to still send forces or to allow him to suffer the consequences of his choice."
 tedjin.0132.a: "Better to have a friendly Kataj, send a small force."

 tedjin.0133.desc: "The First Lord of Felaya has responded to my rejection of his offer by sending his sympathies for my plights. He wishes us to know that all of the faithful will keep my zealous cause in their thoughts and in their prayers, and may the One grant me victory."

 tedjin.0134.desc: "Our illustrious new Tedjin neighbour has aroused the anger of his vassal lords, it would seem. I could certainly help him out... for a price.\n\nLet's see - Agathmardru seems rather nice. Or perhaps indeed the entire coastline could be mine, in exchange for sending some of my boys to aid him..."
 tedjin.0134.a: "I'll bid one force for Agathmardru!"
 tedjin.0134.b: "Fortune favors the bold - the whole coast!"
 tedjin.0134.c: "Why aid them? We'll what we like from the wreckage of the upcoming chaos."

 tedjin.0136.t: "The Bargain of the Corsairs"
 tedjin.0136.desc: "The corsairs of Mardrûak are a fickle lot, with no true loyalty to any but themselves.\n\nThe ruler of Nykkea has approached us with an offer - relinquish traditional coastal lands of my domain, and they will send us large companies of battle-hardened corsairs to assist us against the reactionaries.\n\nWhat should we do?"
 tedjin.0136.a: "A hard bargain, but a fair one."
 tedjin.0136.b: "We will not give an inch of land to pirates!"
 
 tedjin.0137.t: "A Generous Offer, Rejected!"
 tedjin.0137.desc: "The upstart Kataj has refused my kind offer to aid him in his hour of need! Oh well... in the chaos of his fall, I can probably snatch up those lands anyway!"

Shall I aid our brothers in their hour of need?"

 tedjin.0157.t: "A Softening of Tone"
 tedjin.0157.desc: "In words reminiscent of the late Kataj Ayal, our arrogant Kataj has reached out to me with a more conciliatory. It appears that any ideas of swift and urgent reforms have been all but abandoned, without fully giving up on them.\n\nThis at least gives us room to breathe and plan our return to normality."
 tedjin.0157.a: "Good... I guess?"
