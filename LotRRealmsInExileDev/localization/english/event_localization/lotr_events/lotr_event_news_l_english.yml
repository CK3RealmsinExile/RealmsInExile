 news_event.0001.t:0 "The Tedjin Civil War"
 news_event.0001.desc:0 "[GetTitleByKey('k_tedjin').GetName] is roiling with unrest, as the ambitious new [defender.GetTitledFirstName] seeks to push forward political and religious reforms. In response, the more conservative lords of the confederacy, led by [attacker.GetTitledFirstName] have begun to covertly resist [defender.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]'s efforts at every turn.\n\nWhile we might quickly dismiss the internal squabbles of desert tribesmen, the Tedjin are renowned fighters and mercenaries, and occupy a vital buffer between Umbar and Bellakar. Should [attacker.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] and [attacker.GetHerHis] fellow reactionary lords succeed in overthrowing [defender.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], their ambitions will surely turn South once more.\n\nFinally, the crisis in the Confederacy has reached breaking point. Formal demands for the Reformist Kataj to abdicate sent by the Reactionary Faction have been outright rejected and the two sides are now in open war.\n\nTime is fast running out for interested parties to make their interventions as the future of the Confederacy hangs in the balance."

The rebellious lords under the leadership of the reactionary [attacker.GetTitledFirstName] have been humbled, sure to be either stripped of their lands, exiled, or executed.\n\nThe old ways are fast fading in the lands of the Tedjin, and as [defender.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] intensifies [defender.GetHerHis] reforms, [defender.GetHerHis] gaze turns westward towards the coast and may even come to challenge the hegemony of the [GetTitleByKey('k_umbar').GetName] itself..."

 news_event.0008.desc:0 "While technically never independent from the [GetTitleByKey('e_bellakar').GetBaseName], in practical terms the region of [GetTitleByKey('k_felaya').GetBaseNameNoTier] has acted wholly autonomously since the reign of [amrozir.GetFirstNameRegnal] almost 1000 years ago.\n\nPeriods of rapprochement and estrangement have waxed and waned between the province and the greater kingdom, as religiously it stood distinct from the southern heartlands of the kingdom, and its culture nurtured a burgeoning pride in their self-reliance. The First Lords have even warred with Bellakar in the past when they overstepped their bounds.\n\nNow at last relations appear to be on the permanent mend, as the First Lord of Felaya has officially traveled to [GetTitleByKey('c_nilulonde').GetBaseNameNoTier] to pay homage and swear fealty to their new overlord, something which has not been done since the days of [masrakayan.GetTitledFirstName] and [zimrubel.GetTitledFirstName].\n\nThis rapprochement appears to be largely due to [bellakarruler.GetTitledFirstName|U], whose careful diplomacy, overtures, and assurances to the people of Felaya as to their status within the greater kingdom has allowed the rift to be mended without a painful and bloody reconquest."

It was they who first taught the Apysaic Haradrim how to work stone and cultivate agriculture.\n\nHowever, as the Haradrim migrated into the fertile and lush valleys, a coexistence of teacher and student turned into a silent tug of war. The Honnin, unlovely to behold and slow to reproduce, were forced out by the ever multiplying Bôzishnarûd into the Sûza Sûmar, whence they lost much of their knowledge and teachings.\n\nNow though, this has changed. The Honnin, under the leadership of [honnin_restorer.GetTitledFirstName] have reclaimed their ancestral homeland, what they name the Sûzush Agkhôr. Already they are raising new great stone structures, and seem set with a grave determination to never again suffer the ruin they have now begun to recover from."

Saruman is now a prisoner within his own tower and the Ents having hunted down every last of his Uruk-hai in the region, extinguishing the last of his power.\n\nThe Children of Yavanna have dealt a decisive blow against the darkness this day."
