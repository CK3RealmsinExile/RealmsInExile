A larger force might be needed to see that the mûmak is controlled before it causes even more damage."

 ### The Scorching Sun of Harad ###
 harad.0016.t:0 "The Scorching Sun of Harad"
 harad.0016.desc:0 "I can feel the sweat running down my face and dripping from my hair. The desert sun does not care, it tortures even those born and raised in these arid lands. \n\nOutside, the blazing sun scorches the Haradwaith in its unimpeded fury, unfeeling for the lives of men and beasts alike. Slaves and cattle fall dead. Freemen complain about water growing ever scarcer in wells. The people demand that something be done." 
 harad.0016.a:0 "Bagh! What do you want me to do? Get rid of the sun?"
 harad.0016.b:0 "Position troops at the wells so that no drop is wasted."

 ### Lódenûly Dates Flavor Events ###
 harad.0017.t: "Dates of Lódenûly"
 harad.0017.desc: "Today I am enjoying some dates, fresh from the [GetModifier('lodenuly_date_farms_modifier').GetNameWithTooltip]. The area is known for its abundance of dates of all kinds, said to be the sweetest in all of [GetGeographicalRegion('middleearth_bayoformal_khy').GetName] and imported by the nobility at ludicrous prices.\n\nJust savoring their delicious sweetness makes me feel like I'm in paradise! Perhaps there is some truth to the rumors of them granting eternal youth?"
 harad.0017.a: "Let me grab a few more to eat, or maybe a lot more!"

 harad.0018.t: "Fresh Date Harvest"
 harad.0018.desc.early: "It's a miracle! Normally, they wouldn't be in season for several more months, but this year we have been blessed with a second harvest!"
 harad.0018.desc.late: "It's a miracle! The trees just keep producing this year, seemingly to no end. We have been blessed with an exceptionally large harvest this year!"
 harad.0018.desc: ", the [date_farmer.GetWomanMan] in front of me proclaims.\n\nFarmers from the famed [GetModifier('lodenuly_date_farms_modifier').GetNameWithTooltip] have come before me, to report that they are especially productive this year. The baskets of Lódenûly dates they have brought to me are worth a small fortune, and now I must decide what to do with them."

It would do well to provide some of your troops with protection made from this….""
 harad.0019.a: "I think I’ll pass. My troops are fine as is."
 harad.0019.b: "Yes, I will buy some of your hides."
 harad.0019.c: "Surely you can give me a better price."
 
 ### Arani Outposts ###
 harad.0020.t: "[arani_county.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip]: Arani Outposts"
 harad.0020.desc: "The Arani tribes that inhabit [GetGeographicalRegion('middleearth_harad_dunesea').GetName] are some of the toughest survivalists [harad|E] has to offer. Though some raid the caravans, many support them as guards, guides and suppliers.\n\nIn [arani_county.GetNameNoTier], what started as a supply outpost of a local trade route has developed into a small community of sandfolk, who now patrol the area, escort merchant caravans, and hunt bandits against a small fee. Their fortified holdouts are essential in protecting the [trans_haradric_trade|E] routes that cross the desert."
 harad.0020.desc.arani: "Living in the [GetGeographicalRegion('middleearth_harad_dunesea').GetName] has made our tribes some of the toughest survivalists [harad|E] has to offer. Though some raid the caravans, many support them as guards, guides and suppliers. In [arani_county.GetNameNoTier], what started as a supply outpost of a local trade route has developed into a small independent community of Arani sandfolk, who now patrol the area, escort merchant caravans, and hunt bandits against a small fee. Their fortified holdouts are essential in protecting the [trans_haradric_trade|E] routes that cross the desert."
 harad.0020.a: "It means more caravans will pass through safely, I hope!"
 
 ### Qanat Flavor Events ###
 harad.0021.t: "[qanat_county.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip]: New Qanat"
 harad.0021.desc: "A new #italic qanat#! has been constructed in [qanat_county.GetNameNoTier] under the direction of some local leaders.\n\nThese channels, some underground, have been in use across [harad|E] for centuries, and distribute much needed water - typically from rivers or springs - to drier parts of the settled regions. We can expect the area that this #italic qanat#! serves to expand in terms of its agricultural productivity."
 harad.0021.a: "Let us hope this #italic qanat#! will do what it's designed to do."

 harad.0022.t: "[qanat_county.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip]: Qanat Repairs"
 harad.0022.desc: "I just received a report from an official that one of the #italic qanats#! in [qanat_county.GetNameNoTier] has recently dried up. These water channels or aqueducts have been used across [harad|E] for centuries, so there are many of them, some used and some unused like this one. Although this one is not essential per se, it supplements another #italic qanat#! nearby, and lending some funds to repair it to be functional again might be a nice gesture."
 harad.0022.a: "If it's not needed, then why bother?"
 harad.0022.b: "A good idea. Let's get the repairs going."
 harad.0022.c: "I'll not only repair it, but fund building another."

 ### Ksar Flavor Events ###
 harad.0023.t: "[ksar_county.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip]: An Imposing Ksar"
 harad.0023.desc: "I am visiting a prominent #italic ksar#! in [ksar_county.GetNameNoTier] today. These kinds of fortified villages, typically made from adobe and occasionally stone, have been built over centuries to safeguard the locals and any [trans_haradric_merchants|E] passing through.\n\nAs I inspect the structure in all its grandness, I am impressed with the seamless way all the buildings are attached to each other, from the houses to the granaries to the shops, baths, and local temples."
 harad.0023.a: "Imposing! Only a fool would attack this place."
 harad.0023.b: "These outposts secure our trade."

 harad.0024.t: "[ksar_county.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip]: Ksar Maintenance"
 harad.0024.desc: "I’ve received an alarming report from an official that several of the #italic ksars#! in [ksar_county.GetNameNoTier] are in need of dire repairs. These fortified villages, common in Inner [harad|E], are typically made of raw earth, and are thus susceptible to the elements - wind, rain, and more - meaning they require constant maintenance.\n\nWhile the locals are able to continuing maintaining their #italic ksars#! as needed, their time and resources can be limited. As these villages are important in protecting local trade routes and ensuring order and stability in the area, my official tells me it would be prudent to assist the locals by providing them the resources and manpower from elsewhere that they do not necessarily have here."
 harad.0024.a: "If they can do it themselves, I don’t see the need to divert resources to them."
 harad.0024.b: "It’s crucial these remain in good shape - I’ll provide the resources as suggested."

 harad.0025.t: "[ksar_county.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip]: Inside a Ksar"
 harad.0025.desc: "I am paying a visiting to a larger #italic ksars#! in [ksar_county.GetNameNoTier] today. These fortified settlements, consisting of interconnected and attached adobe structures and alleyways, have served as a bedrock of the [trans_haradric_trade|E] routes, protecting the areas they are in from bandits and invaders. As I walk through the winding streets, I almost enter one, when the guides accompanying me warn me not to turn that way.\n\n“That’s where… #italic those#! kinds of outsiders live,” one tells me, when I ask why. “The ones who do the unclean jobs. We haven’t pooled together the funds to erect a gate to separate them from more respectable folk, so we apologise.”"
 harad.0025.a: "It’s good to enforce boundaries."
 harad.0025.b: "They still live here, so I’ll visit them too."
 harad.0025.c: "Not enough funds for the gate, you say?"

 ### Maresh Flavor Events ###
 harad.0026.t: "Mekhor"
 harad.0026.desc: "Today I am inspecting the #italic Mekhor#!, the old, main canal that flows directly [GetTitleByKey('c_maresh').GetNameNoTier]. At the end of the canal is a sizable oasis with the same name. Anyhow, this canal has been an important source of water and used for a variety of purposes, such as irrigating nearby agriculture for centuries.\n\nI listen carefully as some of the specialists in charge of maintaining the canal explain some of the current issues with ensuring the canal remains in good condition. Apparently, they are worried about the state of the canal in the next few years, and are requesting I provide some additional resources - more than already allocated - to assist with the canal’s continued operation."
 harad.0026.a: "I believe the existing resources are sufficient. The city has other needs."
 harad.0026.b: "Very well, you shall have those resources - put them to good use!"

 harad.0027.t: "Coins of Maresh"
 harad.0027.desc: "[praising_merchant.GetFirstName], a visiting [trans_haradric_merchant|E], is explaining how highly people back in his homeland speak of the rose gold coins produced by the mints of [GetTitleByKey('b_arsasak').GetNameNoTier].\n\n“Truly,” [praising_merchant.GetFirstName] says while appraising a coin, “the coins minted here are of the highest quality. It’s no wonder they’re used all over the world!”"
 harad.0027.a: "We take great pride in this, my friend."
 harad.0027.a.tt: "He tosses me the coin and I catch it."

 harad.0028.t: "Goldsmiths"
 harad.0028.desc: "As part of [trans_haradric_trade|E], a lot of gold passes through [GetTitleByKey('c_maresh').GetNameNoTier] to markets elsewhere in [GetGeographicalRegion('middleearth_harad').GetName]. As a result, there is a sizeable community of goldsmiths in the city who have practiced their craft for a long time. A few have settled down here recently, bolstering the existing community of artisans, and helping to enhance the city’s splendor by taking commissions from some of the local elites."
 harad.0028.a: "Perhaps I’ll have time to commission something myself one of these days."
 harad.0028.b: "I should give it a try myself!"

 harad.0029.t: "Maresh Ceramics"
 harad.0029.desc: "A lot of valuable commodities come from [GetGeographicalRegion('middleearth_harad_bayoformal_khy').GetName] and pass through [GetTitleByKey('c_maresh').GetNameNoTier] to markets in [nearharad|E]. However, one cannot say that the city doesn’t export its own products that are in high demand among the people of Khy.\n\nGlazed ceramics from Arysis, for example, have been greatly praised by many in the more southern regions, and recently there has been something of a boom in the business, with our artisans being able to sell more at better prices than before."
 harad.0029.a: "That’s nice to hear!"
 
 ### Kjhana Flavor Events ###
 harad.0030.t: "Goats and Kjhana"
 harad.0030.desc: "I am visiting one of the [GetBuilding('kjhana_forest_01').GetName] in my realm today. A local woman explains to me how the goats, who climb the trees to eat the fruits and nuts, are most useful in extracting the kjhana plant’s valuable seeds, which are used to make food, oil, and more. Traditionally, women like her would harvest the seeds and then mix them with the tree's sap to create a powerful medicine.\n\n“Some people think it’s the goat feces that is the key to this all,” the woman laughs, “but it’s actually the cud that helps us crack the kjhana nuts. It’s dirty business, my [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], but we women are proud of our work.”"
 harad.0030.a: "If it works, it works."
 harad.0030.a.arrogant: "Even watching this is beneath me."
 harad.0030.a.cynical: "So you rifle through goat puke?"
 harad.0030.b: "Let me help you!"
 harad.0030.c: "How do you manage so many goats?"
 harad.0030.d: "How do you mix the Oil and the Sap?"
 
 harad.0031.t: "Kjhana Oil"
 harad.0031.desc: "Today, I met with [kjhana_merchant.GetFirstName], an influential [trans_haradric_merchant|E], who gifted me a flask of kjhana oil from [kjhana_county.GetNameNoTier] to commemorate the occasion.\n\n "It may not look like much, but it is very valuable! [GetBuilding('kjhana_forest_01').GetName] only grow in northern [GetGeographicalRegion('middleearth_harad_bayoformal_harshandatt').GetName].", [kjhana_merchant.GetSheHe] explains,\n\n"They extract the oil from its fruits, and then mix it with the tree's sap to create a powerful medicine. I've found that it can also be used in cooking, by combining it with honey, figs, and other sweet delicacies."
 harad.0031.a: "Perhaps this will help my affliction!"
 harad.0031.b: "Thank you, this will be useful."
 harad.0031.c: "Stay a while! Why don't we enjoy it together?"
 harad.0031.c.success: "[kjhana_merchant.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] stays at court"
 harad.0031.c.failure: "[kjhana_merchant.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] really should get going"
 harad.0031.c.failure.tt: "At least the Kjhana was nice"
 
 ### Mud Mason Flavor Events ###
 harad.0032.t: "Repairing a Mud Structure"
 harad.0032.desc: "A structure in [mason_county.GetNameNoTier] is in dire need of repairs, as its stability has recently suffered greatly. It is built in the typical [mason_culture.GetName] manner, using traditional mudbricks.\n\nAnyways, I have contacted the local [mud_masons|E]’ guild about doing repairs. A master mason, after inspecting the area, says it should be no trouble to reinforce the existing mud structure, but after consulting with some locals, says it is clear that dark and malevolent spirits are present here, and asks for my permission to perform some sacred rites, blessing every individual brick."
 harad.0032.a: "You should focus on these load-bearing elements..."
 harad.0032.b: "Perform your rites of cleansing."
 harad.0032.c: "Superstition! Just get it fixed."
 harad.0032.resolved: "The situation is resolved"

 harad.0033.t: "Secrets of the Mud Masons"
 harad.0033.desc: "[mud_masons|E] are an ubiquitous part of [mason_province.GetCulture.GetName] society. It is they who build and maintain many of the buildings we use everyday.\n\nWhile visiting [mason_county.GetNameNoTier], I pass by some mud masons, who are in the process of constructing a large house for one of the locals. I observe them for some time as they perform daily blessing rituals.\n\nI cannot help but try to eavesdrop on their [mason_province.GetCounty.GetFaith.GetAdjective] recitations and prayers, yet I cannot make out any clear words. Alas, the mud masons are notoriously protective of their secret knowledge, and never reveal it to outsiders. I have heard that some masons even hide the secrets they learned from their masters from other fellow masons!"
 harad.0033.a: "Their secrets must be powerful!"
 harad.0033.b: "Maybe these rituals are all for show."

 harad.0034.t: "A New Contract for Mud Masonry"
 harad.0034.desc: "Most [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetName] families have a contract with a master [mud_mason|E], who is responsible for doing regular maintenance on the mud structures that make up many of our buildings.\n\nAlas, the master mason who my family had contracted out to for many years recently passed away. Traditionally, contracts pass from the master mason to his apprentice, who is typically a relative.\n\nI am in fact familiar with the new master mason, having observed him at work before. I have great confidence in his abilities, and he likewise assures me he will continue to honour his kinsman’s legacy by working hard to maintain my family’s buildings."
 harad.0034.a: "I am sure you will do well."

 harad.0035.t: "Protection for Mud Buildings"
 harad.0035.desc: "I need to construct a small structure in my residence complex, and have employed a number of [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetName] [mud_masons|E] to do the job. As expected, they perform a number of sacrifices, prayers, and other rituals before they start.\n\nHowever, the head mason informs me that the site could use some extra protection from benevolent spirits. If it is fine with me, I need to acquire some grain and animal bones, for the masons to bury them at the corners of the future building."
 harad.0035.a: "We have enough protection already."
 harad.0035.b: "It doesn’t hurt to be extra careful."
 harad.0035.c: "I don’t condone non-[ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetReligion.GetAdjective] heathen practices!"
 
 ### Ammu Bâj / Uljun Flavor Event ###
 harad.0036.t: "Whispers of the Ammu Bâj"
 harad.0036.desc: "The Ammu Bâj is the last major forest of [GetGeographicalRegion('middleearth_harad_bayoformal_khy').GetName], still standing in the [thirdage|E]. It is one of the few places where the monumental Black Uljun trees grow. Black Uljun is incredibly valuable, as it is as sturdy as metal and an excellent material for shipbuilding.\n\nRecently however, workers report hearing strange whispers and seeing shadowy figures between the dense foliage. As a result, our lumbering efforts have slowed down significantly, and it is up to me to decide what to do now."
 harad.0036.a: "Armed Guards will accompany our workers"
 harad.0036.b: "Send Priests to ward off the Dark Spirits"
 harad.0036.c: "Mere superstition! The Ammu Bâj is a wood like any other."
 
 ### Trans-Haradric Merchant Flavor Events ###
 harad.0037.t: "A Merchant Dispute"
 harad.0037.desc: "Many [trans_haradric_merchants|E] pass through my lands, and the trade they bring offers us a  chance to obtain goods from faraway lands.\n\nToday however, a dispute has broken out between two merchants. What started as a minor disagreement over the details of a lucrative trade deal now threatens to become violent, as  both caravans are accompanied by an armed retinue.\n\nI have to do something, or this could end in a bloodbath."
 harad.0037.a: "I will personally negotiate."
 harad.0037.b: "[steward.GetFirstName], take care of it."
 harad.0037.c: "Take this outside our walls."
 harad.0037.a.success: "The Dispute is settled peacefully"
 harad.0037.a.failure: "The Dispute ends in bloodshed"

 ##### DECISION/STORY EVENTS ###

 ### Chelkari Events ###
 harad.0101.t:0 "The Nâdi-manyê Faithful of Pezarsan"
 harad.0101.desc:0 "Grim tidings have come from the south, and so Kalafar is facing the first true crisis of his reign. The small remaining Nâdi-manyê community in Pezarsan, located in the villages straddling the tentative and porous border, had come under intense persecution. His southern vassal, Emir Medja, took the initiative in response to the perceived atrocity. His militias rolled over the border, and before Kalafar knew it, he had a choice to make. Reign in his vassal, and abandon the faithful, or cast his full weight behind the intervention.\n\nKalafar, descendant of the father of the Great Revolt, had no real choice at all. The faithful could not be abandoned. Additionally, this was a chance to further secure his own homeland by pushing back the encircling serpents. To Pezarsan he would go."
 harad.0101.a:0 "The encircling serpent shall have its neck cut off."

 harad.0202.t:0 "The Fate of the Kingdom of Pezarsan"
 harad.0202.desc:0 "It was a hard-fought campaign, but at long last House Ayerikkä stands triumphant as the rightful masters of Pezarsan. The Southern Chieftains have acknowledged you as the rightful king of Pezarsan and shall fight for you as they once did Dasin, swearing their blood-oaths anew. The time has come for you to honour your pledge to your cousin.\n\nWith your promise fulfilled you would be Lord of Pezarsan and vassal, king in all but name, the second highest lord in the Kingdom of Haruzan with the close confidence of your cousin.\n\nBut a thought enters into your head. Why should you now bend the knee to your cousin? You fought at the head of the armies to secure Pezarsan, while Sûladan managed the logistics at the rear. It was you who the people of Pezarsan had come to know, and who greeted you in so kingly a manner, as befits a liberator. But do you dare to risk the consequences of such a betrayal?"
 harad.0202.a:0 "I gave my word. My cousin’s dreams shall be realised. One House, One Haradwaith!"
 harad.0202.b:0 "I am king of Pezarsan now – why should I grovel at the feet of my cousin?"

 harad.0203.t:0 "Broken Dreams"
 harad.0203.desc:0 "It is a bitter pill, but all of your grand visions of sitting upon the throne of Pezarsan have come to naught. Your troops are bloodied and battered; they have been forced back into the core of Haruzan by your foes. There is no more hope of achieving victory upon the field of battle this day.\n\nThe King of Haruzan, silently stewing as you return, swears he will not forget your support for his plans, and that he shall protect you from any possible reprisal from foes abroad. It is time, he claims, for all our house to be once more united under one roof, and bids you ride with him to Amrûn. There will you speak oaths of lord and vassal, so none might question his protection.\n\nRethinking your grand dreams and ambitions after being so thoroughly humbled, you agree without a fight. Perhaps a quiet life as a servant to your cousin is your true calling."
 harad.0203.a:0 "One House, One Haruzan."

 ### Haruzan/Sûladan Expansion Events ###
 harad.0204.t:0 "Pezarsan Kneels"
 harad.0204.desc:0 "At long last, Pezarsan has been reclaimed for my house. But while it is a good start, many of the lands once controlled by my dynasty remain out of my grip. \n\nTo the west, the mouth of the Harnen is held by Umbarean lords, who tax the riverine trade and could theoretically close it entirely. \n\nTo the east of course is hated Chelkar, the heart of the revolt that long ago shattered the hegemony of my house. \n\nWith Pezarsan secure, which way should I expand next? East, or West?"
 harad.0204.a:0 "Chelkar must be punished for their treason!"
 harad.0204.a.tt:0 "Unlocks a decision to send an ultimatum to Chelkar"
 harad.0204.b:0 "We must first secure the mouth of the Harnen"
 harad.0204.b.tt:0 "Unlocks decisions to force the Umbareans to submit"

 harad.0205.t:0 "Perfidious Cousin!"
 harad.0205.desc:0 "In an audacious betrayal, despite his earlier promise to bend the knee if you helped him claim Pezarsan, your cousin has opted to declare himself king of an independant Pezarsan!"

Yet others are adventurers, mercenaries, and daring merchants, who seek wealth and fame on the fickle roads of [harad|E].\n\nI have made efforts to recruit and entice many of these people and their families to settle in [GetTitleByKey('c_maresh').GetNameNoTier]. Although the Great Sand Sea has seen its fair share of adventurous caravaneers hoping to make a fortune by crossing the dangerous Mirror of Fire in the past, trade is now steadily increasing between [GetGeographicalRegion('middleearth_harad_bayoformal_khy').GetName] and [GetGeographicalRegion('middleearth_harad_near_harnen').GetName], and [GetTitleByKey('c_maresh').GetNameNoTier] is quickly becoming a major stopping point for [trans_haradric_merchants|E] along these trade networks.

Through relentless study, exploration of local customs, and mediation between the clans, I have convinced various parties in these feuds to sit together and negotiate a tenuous peace.

 harad.2002.desc: "The ships return once more from the western horizon, their black sails sharply silhouetted against the setting sun. Yet the sea and the golden shores are not all that glitter and glint in the twilight hour.\n\nGold. It is only when the ships make port that the sheer amount of it is revealed, to the amazement of thronging onlookers, who from afar watch with envy the procession of overflowing chests. The riches of all the coasts of Gondor line the pockets of the corsairs first, but what is left for me is no small amount either.\n\nShip-worths of coins and jewels and various other shining objects, and I cannot help but smile. Ah, wine drunk from stolen goblets is always ever the sweeter!"

 harad.2003.desc: "Despite my pest efforts, my forces have been scattered and driven back, and the Gondorians call after our retreating ships.

 harad.2004.desc: "We have been driven back from the shores of Gondor, failing in our goal of conquest. We are not without bounty though, and the hunger of my corsiar will be fufilled for a time. We must regroup and replan, and return again, to finally put those Tarks in their place."

 harad.2005.desc: "I have sent forth the call and my vassals have answered! The fleets of Umbar sail forth, filled with marines, corsiars, and sailors, thristing for the sack and pillage of Gondor. Only the promise of riches holds these men in sway, and may fate preserve whoever stands against them! Some company of their men have been sent to join my forces, ostenisablity in fufilment of their oaths, but I think rather to get their share of the loot."

 harad.2007.desc: "The vile kings of Umbar have refused my summons and negleted my call to war. My forces will be far the weaker for this defection, and they know I shall not have time to punish their treachery. I must turn my sights to Gondor, and after a hard-fought victory, I may return, and they will know my wrath!"

A vast host has gathered outside the walls, eager to hear my words.\n\nRaising my blade high above my head, I proclaim the unification of all the tribes of the Arani. Finally, Darsalan and the Dune Sea have been brought together in unity.\n\nMy sword catches the sunlight and glints with sheer beauty.

A new kingdom has been forged from ashes and sands, and its future is looking bright.\n\nNo longer shall the people of Darsalan toil under the yoke of outsiders. No longer will we be subject to the whims of strangers. We are our own masters, and so we shall remain until this world is ended."
