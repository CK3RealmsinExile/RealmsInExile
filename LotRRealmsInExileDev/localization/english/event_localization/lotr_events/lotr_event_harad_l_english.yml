 ### Chelkari Events ###

 harad.0101.t:0 "The Nâdi-manyê Faithful of Pezarsan"
 harad.0101.desc:0 "Grim tidings have come from the south, and so Kalafar is facing the first true crisis of his reign. The small remaining Nâdi-manyê community in Pezarsan, located in the villages straddling the tentative and porous border, had come under intense persecution. His southern vassal, Emir Medja, took the initiative in response to the perceived atrocity. His militias rolled over the border, and before Kalafar knew it, he had a choice to make. Reign in his vassal, and abandon the faithful, or cast his full weight behind the intervention.\n\nKalafar, descendant of the father of the Great Revolt, had no real choice at all. The faithful could not be abandoned. Additionally, this was a chance to further secure his own homeland by pushing back the encircling serpents. To Pezarsan he would go."
 harad.0101.a:0 "The encircling serpent shall have its neck cut off."

 harad.0202.t:0 "The Fate of the Kingdom of Pezarsan"
 harad.0202.desc:0 "It was a hard-fought campaign, but at long last House Ayerikkä stands triumphant as the rightful masters of Pezarsan. The Southern Chieftains have acknowledged you as the rightful king of Pezarsan and shall fight for you as they once did Dasin, swearing their blood-oaths anew. The time has come for you to honour your pledge to your cousin.\n\nWith your promise fulfilled you would be Lord of Pezarsan and vassal, king in all but name, the second highest lord in the Kingdom of Haruzan with the close confidence of your cousin.\n\nBut a thought enters into your head. Why should you now bend the knee to your cousin? You fought at the head of the armies to secure Pezarsan, while Sûladan managed the logistics at the rear. It was you who the people of Pezarsan had come to know, and who greeted you in so kingly a manner, as befits a liberator. But do you dare to risk the consequences of such a betrayal?"
 harad.0202.a:0 "I gave my word. My cousin’s dreams shall be realized. One House, One Haradwaith!"
 harad.0202.b:0 "I am king of Pezarsan now – why should I grovel at the feet of my cousin?"

 harad.0203.t:0 "Broken Dreams"
 harad.0203.desc:0 "It is a bitter pill, but all of your grand visions of sitting upon the throne of Pezarsan have come to naught. Your troops are bloodied and battered; they have been forced back into the core of Haruzan by your foes. There is no more hope of achieving victory upon the field of battle this day.\n\nThe King of Haruzan, silently stewing as you return, swears he will not forget your support for his plans, and that he shall protect you from any possible reprisal from foes abroad. It is time, he claims, for all our house to be once more united under one roof, and bids you ride with him to Amrûn. There will you speak oaths of lord and vassal, so none might question his protection.\n\nRethinking your grand dreams and ambitions after being so thoroughly humbled, you agree without a fight. Perhaps a quiet life as a servant to your cousin is your true calling."
 harad.0203.a:0 "One House, One Haruzan."

 # Haruzan/Sûladan Expansion Events
 harad.0204.t:0 "Pezarsan Kneels"
 harad.0204.desc:0 "At long last, Pezarsan has been reclaimed for my house. But while it is a good start, many of the lands once controlled by my dynasty remain out of my grip. \n\nTo the west, the mouth of the Harnen is held by Umbarean lords, who tax the riverine trade and could theoretically close it entirely. \n\nTo the east of course is hated Chelkar, the heart of the revolt that long ago shattered the hegemony of my house. \n\nWith Pezarsan secure, which way should I expand next? East, or West?"
 harad.0204.a:0 "Chelkar must be punished for their treason!"
 harad.0204.a.tt:0 "Unlocks a decision to send an ultimatum to Chelkar"
 harad.0204.b:0 "We must first secure the mouth of the Harnen"
 harad.0204.b.tt:0 "Unlocks decisions to force the Umbareans to submit"
 harad.0204.c:0 "Perhaps... perhaps this is all we need"
 harad.0204.c.tt:0 "#W This will permanently disable Haruzan's expansion missions!#!"
 
 harad.0205.t:0 "Perfidious Cousin!"
 harad.0205.desc:0 "In an audacious betrayal, despite his earlier promise to bend the knee if you helped him claim Pezarsan, your cousin has opted to declare himself king of an independant Pezarsan!"
 harad.0205.a:0 "You shall pay dearly for this..."
 
 harad.0206.t:0 "Haruzan Demands Submission!"
 harad.0206.desc:0 "A messanger has arrived from Amrûn with a missive from the lord of Haruzan. It is a list of demands owed to the 'Rightful Lord of Harwan' on account of the 'damages' the Chelkar Revolt caused. Most prominent of them is a demand to submit and pay homage to the King of Haruzan."
 harad.0206.a:0 "We threw off your yoke once, we will not suffer it again!"
 harad.0206.a.tt:0 "#W This will almost certainly trigger an invasion by Haruzan! #!"
 harad.0206.b:0 "A compromise - autonomy for submission, take it or leave it!"
 harad.0206.b.tt:0 "#I You will send a compromise offer to Haruzan which, if accepted, will make you a vassal #!"
 harad.0206.c:0 "I have no choice - I will not spill the blood of my people"

 harad.0207.t:0 "Chelkar Refuses Your Demands!"
 harad.0207.desc:0 "Chelkar has spat in the face of my magnanimous mercy, saying they will never bend the knee to a hour which so unjustly persecuted their forefathers. Now what?"
 harad.0207.a:0 "So you have chosen death..."
 harad.0207.b:0 "Why die for Chelkar?"

 harad.0208.t:0 "Chelkar Offers a Counter-proposal"
 harad.0208.desc:0 "In reply to my demands, Chelkar has responded with a counter-offer. In exchange for submission, they require guarentees on their religious autonomy, and an exemption on fighting in our wars. In exchange, they offer to pay higher taxes."
 harad.0208.a:0 "This is not a negotiation! Marshall my men."
 harad.0208.b:0 "A hard bargain, but for a united Harwan, a fair one."

 harad.0209.t:0 "Haruzan Backs Down!"
 harad.0209.desc:0 "Despite their threats and posturing, in the face of my resolve Haruzan has crumpled. Their armies remain at home, and no sign of threat to my borders has appeared. It would seem that we have won this bout."
 harad.0209.a:0 "Run back to Amrûn!"

 harad.0210.t:0 "Chelkar Submits!"
 harad.0210.desc:0 "In the face of my superior power, Chelkar has wisely chosen to bow to the rightful lords of the Harnen and Harwan. \n\nI am one step closer to restoring the lands of my birthright!"
 harad.0210.a:0 "Inch by inch, brick by brick, we rebuild what was lost."
 
 harad.0213.t:0 "Chelkar is Crushed!"
 harad.0213.desc:0 "Our armies have crushed insolent Chelkar, now once more vassals to the kingdom of Haruzan. The rebels have been scattered, and at last the heart of the revolt which shattered our hegemony has been extinguished. \n\nNow, more lands await our reclamation."
 harad.0213.a:0 "We will tolerate no rebellion!"
 
 harad.0214.t:0 "Chelkar Repulses Us!"
 harad.0214.desc:0 "Despite our numbers, Chelkar has repulsed and parried our every thrust. Our armies are scattered, our leaders in retreat. We have had no choice but to return home to lick our wounds. \n\nChelkar, heart of the hated revolt, lives to see another day."
 harad.0214.a:0 "Damn them. DAMN THEM!"
 
 harad.0215.t:0 "The Valiant Defense"
 harad.0215.desc:0 "Despite their numbers, threats, and even invasion, Haruzan has been soundly defeated in the field. Their pretensions of lordship over Harwan have been proven a vain falsehood, clinging onto tattered dreams. \n\nPerhaps more than simple surviving as a holdout, the time might have come for the Old Ways to begin a more aggressive expansion..."
 harad.0215.a:0 "Run back to Amrûn, and never return!"
 
 harad.0217.t:0 "Chelkar Reclaimed!"
 harad.0217.desc:0 "Chelkar, that troublesome and restless province, has finally been brought back into the fold. While it will likely be some years before it is completely pacified, we are one step closer to a reunified Haradwaith."
 harad.0217.a:0 "Soon, we shall reclaim our lost glory."
 
 harad.0219.t:0 "The Desolation of [perfidious_cousin.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]"
 harad.0219.desc:0 "Such foolishness, [perfidious_cousin.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]! After all my aid, now we come to this. Well, I have had enough! Now not even my own family respects my goals or ambitions! No more. I swear it. We will rebuild our realm, even if I must do it alone, with the whole world set against me! \n\nTo the west, the mouth of the Harnen is held by Umbarean lords, who tax the riverine trade and could theoretically close it entirely. \n\nTo the east of course is hated Chelkar, the heart of the revolt that long ago shattered the hegemony of my house. \n\nWith Pezarsan now secure, which way should I expand next? East, or West?"
 
 harad.0220.t:0 "Haruzan Demands Submission!"
 harad.0220.desc:0 "A messenger has arrived from Amrûn, bearing the seal of [haruzan_king.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] [haruzan_king.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]. In it, [haruzan_king.GetSheHe] makes clear in no uncertain terms that [haruzan_king.GetSheHe] views my land as part of [haruzan_king.GetHerHis] rightful domain. \n\n[haruzan_king.GetSheHe|U] will permit me to remain in my position unmolested, so long as I submit to [haruzan_king.GetHerHis] authority..."
 harad.0220.a:0 "The scions of Númenor, bow to a warlord of Harad?"
 harad.0220.b:0 "Discretion is the better part of valour."
 
 harad.0221.t:0 "Defiance of [defiant_umbarean.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] [defiant_umbarean.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]"
 harad.0221.desc:0 "In defiance of my rightful claims, [defiant_umbarean.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] [defiant_umbarean.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] has decried me as an arbitrary, warmongering tyrant with no right to [defiant_umbarean.GetHerHis] lands. \n\nFurthermore, [defiant_umbarean.GetSheHe] has sternly warned that if there is any movement of troops towards [defiant_umbarean.GetHerHis] lands, [defiant_umbarean.GetSheHe] shall assume I meant to engage in war, and react appropriately!"
 harad.0221.a:0 "Then I shall push you into the very sea!"
 harad.0221.b:0 "[defiant_umbarean.GetSheHe|U] will live... for now"
 
 harad.0222.t:0 "Submission of [submissive_umbarean.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] [submissive_umbarean.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]"
 harad.0222.desc:0 "Upon receving my emissaries and my demands, [submissive_umbarean.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] [submissive_umbarean.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] has agreed to my terms on all accounts. [submissive_umbarean.GetSheHe|U] has only requested that I keep my word, and guarentee [submissive_umbarean.GetHerHis] rights as my vassal."
 harad.0222.a:0 "My word is always true"
 
 harad.0225.t:0 "The Harnen is Secure!"
 harad.0225.desc:0 "At long last, I have brought the mouth of the Harnen back under the control of Haruzan and my house. \n\nWith this, we are one step closer to rebuilding the fallen empire of Haradwaith."
 harad.0225.a:0 "Trade shall flow like a river."
 
 harad.0226.t:0 "Haradwaith Rises Anew"
 harad.0226.desc:0 "From the ashes of our fall, we rise anew.\n\nAfter many years and generations of effort, at last my house stands supreme over Near Harad once more. Harwan is again unified beneath our gracious leadership, and will at last be able to push back against the foreigners who so long have preyed upon us! \n\nThere remains yet more to do, more of my people still outside this realm - but now, the tide is turning. And tonight, we celebrate the fruits of our labours."
 harad.0226.a:0 "Arise, sons of Harwan!"
 
 ### Haggling for Imported Mumakil ###
 harad.0500.t:0 "Traders of the South"
 harad.0500.desc:0 "As per my request, a meeting has been arranged with [mumakil_merchant.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], a well respected trader, and [mumakil_merchant.GetHerHis] guild connections are one of the few ways to import the mighty Mûmakil so far from their native habitats.\n\nThese great beasts are impressive weapons once fully trained and equipped, but it is no exaggeration to say they cost a small fortune to outfit and upkeep, particularly if I am to import them from afar.\n\nLooking over the contract [mumakil_merchant.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] has proposed to supply me with the mighty beasts, what should I do?"
 harad.0500.a:0 "Expensive, but worth the price."
 harad.0500.a.amrun:0 "Worthy stock for the pens of the Harnen."
 harad.0500.discount.tt:0 "#P Cost Reduction#! from your [GetBuilding('wonder_palace_of_haruzan_03').GetName]: @gold_icon!#P -20%#!"
 harad.0500.b:0 "I can drive a harder bargain than that, [mumakil_merchant.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]!"
 harad.0500.b.amrun:0 "Perhaps this could be seen as a form of tribute?"
 harad.0500.b.tt_success:0 "You successfully barter down the prices"

The beast leaves a trail of destruction in its wake, no fence nor wall able to contain its stampeding feet.\n\nMany peasants have tried to restrain it but have lost their lives in the process. A larger force might be needed to see that the mûmak is controlled before it causes even more damage."
 harad.0014.a:0 "Leave it be. Who are we to stand against such a force of nature?"
 harad.0014.b:0 "Cursed beast! I shall have its tusks adorn my halls."

The desert sun does not care, it tortures even those born and raised in these arid lands. \n\nOutside, the blazing sun scorches the Haradwaith in its unimpeded fury, unfeeling for the lives of men and beasts alike. Slaves and cattle fall dead. Freemen complain about water growing ever scarcer in wells. The people demand that something be done."

Defying the physical challenge of the Dune Sea, you have unified north and south, all of Harad under a single banner for the first time in known history. \n\nNo longer shall your people be second-rate powers, pawns in the games of the Númenóreans or Sauron. You are now leader of a mighty state, a great empire - Harad!

Scarlet and sable banners flutter in the wind, and the shields and helms of my men glint in the sun.\n\nLong have the wretched and indolent [gondorians|E] occupied Harondor, which should justly be ours by right. Yet if they shall not give it to us, we shall take it. Let them be laid bare by land and sea, their coasts plundered by my fleets, and their armies routed and sent back to their homeland. Much have they stolen from us, so let us pay them back in kind!"

Given that most of Gondor's best men will be fighting tooth and nail in the south, some might suggest that the coast would be utterly wide open!\n\nSuch confident thought would be fools, of course, but our years of preparation have certainly not gone to waste.

Yet the sea and the golden shores are not all that glitter and glint in the twilight hour.\n\nGold. It is only when the ships make port that the sheer amount of it is revealed, to the amazement of thronging onlookers, who from afar watch with envy the procession of overflowing chests. The riches of all the coasts of Gondor line the pockets of the corsairs first, but what is left for me is no small amount either.\n\nShip-worths of coins and jewels and various other shining objects, and I cannot help but smile.
