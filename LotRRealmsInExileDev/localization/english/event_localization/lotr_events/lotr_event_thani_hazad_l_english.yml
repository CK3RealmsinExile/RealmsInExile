The news was both somber and momentous: I had inherited [former_member.GetHerHis] position on the Council. My thoughts swirled with the weight of new responsibility as I prepared for the ceremonial induction.\n\nThe ceremony is a solemn affair, steeped in tradition and reverence. The air is thick with the scent of incense as I stand before the Council, their eyes upon me. With a steady hand, [balan_lai_leader.GetTitledFirstName] presents me with a Lion's Head Brooch, its golden mane glinting in the candlelight. The brooch is a symbol of authority and unity among the Princes, now pinned close to my heart.\n\nI feel the weight of my new responsibility, the eyes of our ancestors upon me, as my voice echoes in the chamber, firm and resolute..."

Not only had I inherited [former_member.GetHerHis] position on the [balan_lai|E], but I had also been chosen to lead the Council. The gravity of this dual responsibility settled over me like a dense fog, blending sorrow with an overwhelming sense of duty.\n\nThe ceremonial induction took place in the Grand Council Chamber, a hall steeped in history and tradition. As I approached the dais, the other Princes observed with solemn reverence, acknowledging the honour bestowed upon me. They took their turns to recite the ancient rites and annoit my brow with perfumed oils, each rite resonating with the echoes of our ancestors.\n\nAt the culmination of the ceremony, the Master of Ceremonies presented me with a Lion's Head Brooch, its golden mane glinting with the light of a thousand torches. The brooch is a symbol of authority and unity among the Princes, now pinned close to my heart. As I gaze upon the gathered assembly, I silently pledge to honour my [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMeShort', former_member )]'s memory and to lead the Balân-lâi with unwavering dedication, wisdom, and strength."

The passing of [former_member.GetName] had left a void in the Council, but today we welcomed [new_member.GetFirstName], the one who would replace [former_member.GetHerHim].\n\nI watched as [new_member.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] approached the dais, [new_member.GetHerHis] steps measured and [new_member.GetHerHis] eyes resolute. The Master of Ceremonies intoned the ancient rites, each word a reminder of our shared legacy and the responsibilities that come with it.

As a member of this esteemed council, I have been asked whether I wish to exercise my right to veto [potential_joiner.GetHerHis] entry. The weight of this decision rests heavily upon me, knowing that it will significantly impact our future deliberations and the balance of power within the Council.\n\nReflecting on [potential_joiner.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] character and past deeds, I must carefully consider whether [potential_joiner.GetHerHis] inclusion will strengthen our ranks or sow discord among us. This choice is not to be taken lightly, for it will shape the very fabric of our council's unity and effectiveness.\n\nAs I deliberate, I am keenly aware of the trust placed in me by my fellow members and the responsibility I bear to uphold the principles and integrity of the Balân-lâi."

 lotr_thani_hazad.9013.desc:0 "The letter arrived with the seal of the [balan_lai|E], but as I read its contents, my heart sank. My application had been vetoed by [vetoing_member.GetName], and I would have to wait another ten years before I could appeal to the Council again. Frustration and annoyance surge within me; I had been so close to joining their ranks, only to be thwarted by a single dissenting voice!\n\n[vetoing_member.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] veto felt like a personal slight, a barrier placed before me just as I was ready to contribute to the legacy of the Council. The weight of this setback is heavy, and the prospect of waiting a whole decade seems almost unbearable.\n\nDespite the frustration, I know I have to remain resolute. This is a setback, not a defeat. Over the next ten years, I will continue to prove my worth and dedication, ensuring that when the time comes to appeal once more, my case will be undeniable!"
