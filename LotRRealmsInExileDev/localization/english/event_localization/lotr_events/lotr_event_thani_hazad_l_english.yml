"It is said to be one of the best wines of that land. Can I tempt you to savour it?" \n\n[stormhost_spy.GetFirstName] seems genuinely excited about this."
 lotr_thani_hazad.1020.a:0 "Very well! Let us have a few glasses!"
 lotr_thani_hazad.1020.b:0 "Just a small, dignified taste, and no more."

The creature meets my gaze with a calm attitude, before letting out a single, melodious chirp. \n\n"I was sure you would enjoy the company of a noble bird such as this," my courtier eagerly explains. \n\nIt seems to me [stormhost_spy.GetSheHe] is glad, but surely this songbird will cost me a fortune?"
 lotr_thani_hazad.1040.a:0 "Truly a marvellous creature!"
