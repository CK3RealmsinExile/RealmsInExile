 lotr_thani_hazad.1001.t:0 "A Pleasant Gathering"
 lotr_thani_hazad.1001.desc:0 "I am hosting a small revel at my court, inviting my close family and most of my courtiers. It is a warm evening, with clear skies and the glitter of stars above us, and people are enjoying themselves, as am I. \n\nIn the midst of the party, [stormhost_spy.GetFirstName], one of my courtiers, approaches me. "My [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsName], what a joyous occasion this is," [stormhost_spy.GetSheHe] begins. "If you are willing, I have something I would show you that will make this evening even grander!" \n\n[stormhost_spy.GetFirstName] wishes me to follow [stormhost_spy.GetHerHim], with an exited look on [stormhost_spy.GetHerHis] face."
 lotr_thani_hazad.1001.a:0 "Very well, [stormhost_spy.GetFirstName], show me what you have prepared."
 lotr_thani_hazad.1001.b:0 "Can't you see I'm quite busy enjoying myself right now?"
 lotr_thani_hazad.1001.c:0 "Follow you into some dark corner? I think #italic not! #! Guards!"
 lotr_thani_hazad.1001.d:0 "How about some merriment and dance instead?"
 
 lotr_thani_hazad.1020.t:0 "Exquisite Dorwinion Wine"
 lotr_thani_hazad.1020.desc:0 "As the crowd parts to let me and [stormhost_spy.GetFirstName] pass, I spy a small table upon which sits an unopened wine bottle. This must be what my courtier wished to show me? \n\n"This comes from far-flung [dorwinion|E], my [ROOT.Char.GetNamePossessiveRegnal]," [stormhost_spy.GetFirstName] explains eagerly. "It is said to be one of the best wines of that land. Can I tempt you to savour it?" \n\n[stormhost_spy.GetFirstName] seems genuinely excited about this."
 lotr_thani_hazad.1020.a:0 "Very well! Let us have a few glasses!"
 lotr_thani_hazad.1020.b:0 "Just a small, dignified taste, and no more." 
 lotr_thani_hazad.1020.c:0 "This is not to my liking, [stormhost_spy.GetFirstName]."
 
 lotr_thani_hazad.1030.t:0 "A Masterful Portrait"
 lotr_thani_hazad.1030.desc:0 "We leave behind my court's main hall and enter a smaller room nearby, where I am greeted by a man standing next to an empty canvas. He has evidently been expecting us. \n\n"A glorious portrait, for a glorious ruler," my courtier [stormhost_spy.GetFirstName] explains. Their eyes turn to me, awaiting a reply or reaction. \n\nThis might be an expensive suggestion, and yet - fit for a ruler such as myself it may well be..."
 lotr_thani_hazad.1030.a:0 "What a great idea!"
 lotr_thani_hazad.1030.b:0 "The priviledge of painting #italic me #! should be reward enough."
 lotr_thani_hazad.1030.c:0 "This is not to my liking, [stormhost_spy.GetFirstName]."
 
 lotr_thani_hazad.1040.t:0 "An Exotic Bird"
 lotr_thani_hazad.1040.desc:0 "As I follow my courtier [stormhost_spy.GetFirstName] to the other side of my hall, I spy a flash of vibrant colors ahead. It is a caged songbird of the like I've never seen before. The creature meets my gaze with a calm attitude, before letting out a single, melodious chirp. \n\n"I was sure you would enjoy the company of a noble bird such as this," my courtier eagerly explains. \n\nIt seems to me [stormhost_spy.GetSheHe] is glad, but surely this songbird will cost me a fortune?"
 lotr_thani_hazad.1040.a:0 "Truly a marvellous creature!"
 lotr_thani_hazad.1040.b:0 "Such an #italic exquisite #! sight! It must be mine!"
 lotr_thani_hazad.1040.c:0 "This is not to my liking, [stormhost_spy.GetFirstName]."
 
 lotr_thani_hazad.1101.t:0 "A Bold Request"
 lotr_thani_hazad.1101.desc:0 "As I enter my great hall in order to set assignments for my servants, I am approached by [stormhost_spy.GetFirstName]. "A moment of your time, my [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsName]?" [stormhost_spy.GetSheHe] asks, and I nod in approval. \n\n"I have served you loyally, my liege, and I wish to do more. Please consider granting me the honour of becoming your spymaster." \n\nI am surprised, maybe even a little stunned by such bold a request. This is not a decision I should be taking lightly..."
 lotr_thani_hazad.1101.a:0 "Very well... serve me faithfully, [stormhost_spy.GetFirstName]."
 lotr_thani_hazad.1101.b:0 "I have quite a capable spymaster already."
 lotr_thani_hazad.1101.c:0 "I do not trust you... in fact, I never did!"
 
 lotr_thani_hazad.1150.t:0 "Whispering In My Ear"
 lotr_thani_hazad.1150.desc:0 "It has been some time since I granted [stormhost_spy.GetFirstName] the position of spymaster. In the past few days, [stormhost_spy.GetSheHe] has often approached me, wishing to converse with me. \n\n"My reports show that the power of [GetTitleByKey('e_thon_an_kharlokh').GetName] is growing by each day, my [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsName]," [stormhost_spy.GetSheHe] states. "Perhaps it would be wise to avoid a possible invasion by appeasing [stormking.GetName] with a tribute?" \n\nSuch a suggestion is not to be taken lightly..."
 lotr_thani_hazad.1150.desc.new:0 "Once more I am approached by my courtier [stormhost_spy.GetFirstName], repeating the advice for me to become tributary to [stormking.GetName] of [GetTitleByKey('e_thon_an_kharlokh').GetName]. \n\n"It is what's best for the realm, " [stormhost_spy.GetSheHe] insists."
 lotr_thani_hazad.1150.a:0 "This may indeed be a wise course of action..."
 event_thani_hazad_1155_a:0 "[stormking.GetName] becomes your [suzerain|E]."
 lotr_thani_hazad.1150.b:0 "This is a #italic terrible #! idea!"
 lotr_thani_hazad.1150.c:0 "Suggesting a motion like this... is #italic treason. #!"
 lotr_thani_hazad.1150.d:0 "Do not suggest such foolishness again!"
 
 lotr_thani_hazad.1200.t:0 "A Secret Uncovered"
 lotr_thani_hazad.1200.desc:0 "Late in the evening, I am approached by my spymaster, [spymaster.GetFirstName]. \n\n"My [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsName], I have grave news," [spymaster.GetSheHe] begins. "I've uncovered that [stormhost_spy.GetFirstName], your courtier, has been writing secret letters to [stormking.GetName]! [stormhost_spy.GetSheHe] is a spy!" \n\nI am shocked by this revelation. A spy at my court? I must react accordingly, and immediately."
 lotr_thani_hazad.1200.desc.new:0 "As I hold court in my great hall, my spymaster, [spymaster.GetFirstName], approaches me. "News from your prisoner, [stormhost_spy.GetFirstName]", [spymaster.GetSheHe] states. "After spending some time in the dungeon, [stormhost_spy.GetFirstName] has finally admitted the truth: [stormhost_spy.GetSheHe] is a spy for [stormking.GetName]!" \n\nWhile shocking, this revelation confirms my suspicions about [stormhost_spy.GetFirstName]. I must deal with [stormhost_spy.GetHerHim] accordingly, and immediately."
 lotr_thani_hazad.1200.a:0 "Treason has a price... off with [stormhost_spy.GetHerHis] head!"
 lotr_thani_hazad.1200.b:0 "I will show mercy. You are banished, [stormhost_spy.GetFirstName]."
 lotr_thani_hazad.1200.c:0 "If I spare you, you must betray your master and become my agent."
