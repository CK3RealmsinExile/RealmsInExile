 mundburgian.3021.t: "[courtier_1.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip] Adventurers"
 mundburgian.3021.desc: "I have come into contact with a band of [courtier_1.GetCulture.GetName] adventurers led by a [courtier_1.GetWomanMan] named [courtier_1.GetFirstName], who have expressed interest in serving me. [courtier_1.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] agreed to provide something in return for me allowing [courtier_1.GetHerHis] band to move into my territories.\n\n"
 mundburgian.3021.desc.courtiers: "I told [courtier_1.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] that I want one of [courtier_1.GetHerHis] people to act as an intermediary between myself and the newly settled [courtier_1.GetCulture.GetCollectiveNounNoTooltip]. [courtier_1.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] has offered to join my court as a result, though [courtier_1.GetSheHe] says if that doesn’t work out, [courtier_1.GetSheHe] can also recommend [courtier_1.GetHerHis] associate, [courtier_2.GetFullName]."
 mundburgian.3021.desc.colonists: "[courtier_1.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] group is less a small band, and more a small tribe of people. Fortunately they come in peace! There are several places in the [ROOT.Char.GetPrimaryTitle.GetName] suitable for settlement, and the [courtier_1.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip] under [courtier_1.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] have begun to settle there to contribute to the region’s vitality."
 mundburgian.3021.desc.mercenaries: "It goes without saying that the [courtier_1.GetCulture.GetCollectiveNounNoTooltip] are known, even feared, for their abilities in war. [courtier_1.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] commands many honorable warriors, who could prove more loyal than the average cutthroat hirelings, if they were to find the right liege. From now on, these warriors will serve me, and strike fear into my enemies’ hearts!"
 mundburgian.3021.desc.traders: "Though notorious as warriors and raiders, the [courtier_1.GetCulture.GetCollectiveNounNoTooltip] are also cunning in commerce and widely traveled. The [northrons|E]' extensive trade networks in the northern [westlands|E] are a valuable asset for any business-minded ruler.\n\nAs it so happens, [courtier_1.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] has experience traveling and trading, and is offering to bring traders in my territories and build a productive trade relationship with me."
 mundburgian.3021.desc.rulers: "Following our negotiations, I have allowed the [courtier_1.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip] settlers to govern themselves under [courtier_1.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] in [award_county.GetNameNoTier]. [courtier_1.GetSheHe|U] has happily agreed to such an arrangement.\n\nThere is wisdom in agreeing to this, for these [courtier_1.GetCulture.GetCollectiveNounNoTooltip] have agreed to help protect our lands against foreign attacks and bandits. With the courage of the [northmen|E] on our side, we will be unstoppable!"
 mundburgian.3021.desc.conclusion: "\n\nLastly, I could see if I can ask [courtier_1.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] to help me defend my territories against incursions and reinforce my garrisons."

 mundburgian.3022.t: "Defending Against Outside Attacks"
 mundburgian.3022.desc.intro: "After we negotiated a favorable agreement to both sides, I discussed with [courtier_1.GetFirstName] whether [courtier_1.GetSheHe] and [courtier_1.GetHerHis] could further assist me in preventing or resisting future, large-scale attacks on my territory.\n\n"
 mundburgian.3022.desc.no.courtiers: "[courtier_1.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] told me that [courtier_1.GetHerHis] band of [courtier_1.GetCulture.GetCollectiveNoun] was merely a small band of adventurers, hardly the kind of group able to effectively fight against an army or man a whole garrison. [courtier_1.GetSheHe|U] also claimed [courtier_1.GetSheHe] doubted whether [courtier_1.GetHerHis] connections back in [rhovanion|E] would be of much use to us."
 mundburgian.3022.desc.no.colonists: "[courtier_1.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] said that many in [courtier_1.GetHerHis] band were relatively peaceful farmers and craftspeople, not the kind who would be able to resist against any military incursion. They would do better, [courtier_1.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] explained, trying to improve these lands."
 mundburgian.3022.desc.no.mercenaries: "[courtier_1.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] reassured me that while [courtier_1.GetHerHis] riders are capable, and can fight in any battle, recruiting a steady stream of reinforcements is a different matter. It seems [courtier_1.GetSheHe] apparently does not have the clout or influence to inspire more soldiers from [rhovanion|E]."
 mundburgian.3022.desc.no.traders: "[courtier_1.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] shook [courtier_1.GetHerHis] head and said [courtier_1.GetSheHe] and [courtier_1.GetHerHis] band are more used to trading than war. Of course, all merchants engage in raiding every now and then, but to prepare resistance against potential large invasions is another matter."
 mundburgian.3022.desc.yes.courtiers: "[courtier_1.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] said that though [courtier_1.GetHerHis] band of adventurers is small, [courtier_1.GetSheHe] does have a number of connections back in [rhovanion|E] that might be of use. [courtier_1.GetSheHe|U] says [courtier_1.GetSheHe] can use these connections to persuade more soldiers to come and strengthen our garrisons."
 mundburgian.3022.desc.yes.colonists: "[courtier_1.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] said that I can rest in peace, because while many of the settlers [courtier_1.GetSheHe] brought with [courtier_1.GetHerHim] are peaceful farmers and craftspeople, they have strong ties with their brethren in [rhovanion|E]. Their relatives can strengthen our garrisons, and help us against outside invaders."
 mundburgian.3022.desc.yes.mercenaries: "[courtier_1.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] laughed as [courtier_1.GetSheHe] told me that [courtier_1.GetHerHis] riders are greatly feared even on the wild plains of [rhovanion|E]. Their presence in my territories means I will have gained some degree of respect from potential attackers, who will defer from crossing with me – and [courtier_1.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] riders."
 mundburgian.3022.desc.yes.traders: "[courtier_1.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] told me the [courtier_1.GetCulture.GetCollectiveNoun] are notorious for their abilities in war, but few know of their skill in commerce. With stronger trade connections between my territories and [rhovanion|E], it will be easy to find willing recruits to bolster our garrisons and shield us from any invaders."
 mundburgian.3022.desc.conclusion.no: "\n\nSensing my disappointment, [courtier_1.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] reassures me that [courtier_1.GetHerHis] band of adventurers will do what they can to settle well into my realm, so at least it will be stronger if raiders do arrive in my territory. Still, I wonder if [courtier_1.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] is actually telling the truth, or if [courtier_1.GetSheHe] is simply uninterested in helping."
 mundburgian.3022.desc.conclusion.yes: "\n\nAlthough this does not permanently reduce the long-term threats that we face, it is excellent news. Working with [courtier_1.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] band has turned out to be even better than I initially thought!"

 mundburgian.3022.c: "In the meanwhile, [courtier_1.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] can stay at my court"
 mundburgian.3022.d: "Now, that aside, I would like [courtier_2.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] in my court"

 mundburgian.3023.desc.intro: "I came into contact with a band of [courtier_1.GetCulture.GetName] adventurers led by a [courtier_1.GetWomanMan] named [courtier_1.GetFullName], who have expressed interest in serving me and moving into my territories.

 mundburgian.3023.desc.colonists: "[courtier_1.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] band is more like a small tribe of people, and they arrived in relatively large numbers, so I was hoping they would settle down in parts of my realm that need more people."
 mundburgian.3023.desc.mercenaries: "It goes without saying that the [courtier_1.GetCulture.GetCollectiveNounNoTooltip] are known for their abilities in war – [courtier_1.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] commands a number of swift riders, who I wish to integrate into my armies."
 mundburgian.3023.desc.traders: "Though notorious as brazen riders and adventuers, the [courtier_1.GetCulture.GetCollectiveNounNoTooltip] are also cunning in business and widely traveled, and I was hoping we could agree to some mutually beneficial trade deals."
 mundburgian.3023.desc.mid: "\n\nWe initially agreed on a deal for me to pay these adventurers generously; alas, my negotiations with [courtier_1.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] went awry."

 mundburgian.3023.desc.titles: "The greedy brute now says I should hand over [award_county.GetNameNoTier] to [courtier_1.GetHerHim] to rule!"
 mundburgian.3023.desc.conclusion: "I must respond to these preposterous demands carefully, lest these riders get any funny ideas…."
 mundburgian.3023.a: "Fine. The scoundrel will get what [courtier_1.GetSheHe] wants."
 mundburgian.3023.b: "[courtier_1.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], you will not alter the deal like this."
 mundburgian.3023.b.failure: "[courtier_1.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] does not comply, resulting in negative consequences."
 mundburgian.3023.b.success: "[courtier_1.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] backs down, and may even grudgingly respect your resolve."
 mundburgian.3024.t: "The Adventurers Settle Down"
 mundburgian.3024.desc: "Handing over [award_county.GetNameNoTier] to [courtier_1.GetFirstName] was a controversial decision, but I had little choice, as I did not want my territories to suffer from the wrath of [courtier_1.GetHerHis] adventurers. It is better to have [courtier_1.GetHerHim] as a questionable ally than to have [courtier_1.GetHerHim] marauding across my lands."
 mundburgian.3024.desc.courtiers: "\n\nAs a gesture of nominal goodwill, [courtier_1.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] agreed to my initial proposal that [courtier_1.GetSheHe] send one of [courtier_1.GetHerHis] people to stay in my court as a liaison of sorts. In this case, [courtier_1.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] selected a [courtier_2.GetWomanMan] by the name of [courtier_2.GetFirstName] to fulfill that role."
 mundburgian.3024.desc.colonists: "\n\nJust like in our original agreement, [courtier_1.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] people settled in large numbers in my territory. Despite their treachery, once they’ve established themselves in their new homes, they should prove to be productive settlers under the leadership of [courtier_1.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]."
 mundburgian.3024.desc.mercenaries: "\n\nTo fulfill our original agreement, [courtier_1.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] says that [courtier_1.GetSheHe] has instructed many of [courtier_1.GetHerHis] warriors to now fight under my banner; even though [courtier_1.GetSheHe] is now a ruler, [courtier_1.GetHerHis] warriors will be loyal to only me no matter what, even if it means fighting against [courtier_1.GetHerHim] in the future. We’ll see if this holds true. "
 mundburgian.3024.desc.traders: "\n\nTo my relief, [courtier_1.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] is doing [courtier_1.GetHerHis] part per our original agreement, and using [courtier_1.GetHerHis] connections to expand the trade networks in my realm. Though we got off to a bad start, and though I may never quite trust these [courtier_1.GetCulture.GetCollectiveNoun], at least my realm’s economy will grow!"
 mundburgian.3024.desc.conclusion: "\n\nWith the formalities concluded, [courtier_1.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] has officially become the [courtier_1.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] of [award_county.GetNameNoTier].
