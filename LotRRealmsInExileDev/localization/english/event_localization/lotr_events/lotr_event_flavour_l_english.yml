 flavourevent.0001.desc.end.good:0 "It was difficult to describe at first, but finally it became clear - rushing waters, and in the distance the ringing of crystal bells and melodies on harp-string.\n\nI feel a bone-deep sense of peace settle into me - is this a gift of the Master of Dreams, to feel the contentment of his gardens?"
 flavourevent.0001.desc.end.evil:0 "It was difficult to describe at first, but finally it became clear - the pained groans of my suffering enemies fill the air, a nectar sweeter than any wine.\n\nThe beating of hammers echo in the background, the heralds of the coming conquest. My mind clearing, the premonition has given me a new sense of confidence!"
 flavourevent.0001.a:0 "Truly the sweetest of sounds!"

 flavourevent.0002.desc.end.good:0 "I could scarcely make anything out of it - what an awful racket! It was as if an entire army was clanging it's swords directly in my ear, combined with a shrill wail and the endless beating of drums, rattling my skull.\n\nMake it stop..."
 flavourevent.0002.desc.end.evil:0 "At first it was just some mild rustling, but then I heard it - water. Great, unimaginable amounts of water, rushing forth in a torrent that would drown me where I stood. I shook, paralyzed with dread, my heart beating with the force of a hundred drums. The water comes!\n\nMake it stop..."

The man, a well-travelled gastronome who enjoys discovering the foods of different lands, offered me honey cakes from the Vales of Anduin for a modest price.\n\nSweet, delicate and dripping with amber honey, they would surely be a rare treat to eat!"

 flavourevent.0004.a:0 "I'll find something else to distract myself with."

After I woke up, I immediately found the nearest person, one of my servants, and began to recount what had happened.\n\nExcept... by that point I had forgotten what had happened in my dream. I stumbled over my words as I struggled to recall any details as my servant stood there awkwardly.\n\nWhy is it often too easy to forget what the Master of Desires has shown us in our dreams?"
 flavourevent.0005.a:0 "How irritating. Oh well!"
 flavourevent.0005.b:0 "I must remember! Why can't I? Why?"

 flavourevent.0006.a:0 ""I am sincerely sorry for your loss and the pain you are going through.""
 flavourevent.0006.b:0 ""Your child is now in [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.DivineRealm] with [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName].""

 flavourevent.0008.desc:0 "I recently came into possession of an ancient tome from the early [secondage|E] and reading it is very difficult, its deeper meanings continuing to elude me.\n\nEven my most learned of scholars have had trouble reading the book. And yet, I'm convinced that it contains great wisdom if only I can understand it!\n\nShould I persevere to try to continue reading through this, or should I give up?"
 flavourevent.0008.a:0 "This book is not worth my energy."
 flavourevent.0008.b:0 "I must try no matter what!"

No of course not, it couldn't have been... or maybe it was....\n\nI force a smile to buy myself time as my brain fails to recall their name."
 flavourevent.0009.a:0 "I'll just have to guess their name!"
 flavourevent.0009.b:0 "I'll skilfully speak in a way that avoids their name, awkward as it may be."

 flavourevent.0010.desc.1:0 "Lately, rumours are circulating about how I had an amorous encounter with one of the commonfolk in a nearby village that resulted in a child. This is, of course, completely foolish."
 flavourevent.0010.desc.widowed:0 "Since the death of the love of my life, I swore never to look at another. These vile rumours make a mockery of my beloved's memory!"
 flavourevent.0010.desc.chaste:0 "I don't even feel lust at the best of times! It makes no sense that I would endanger myself for that which I don't even want."
 flavourevent.0010.desc.lustful:0 "Now I love to have a good tumble with a good looking thing as much as any lusty [ROOT.Char.GetWomanMan], but that doesn't mean I've found anyone in that village to my liking."
 flavourevent.0010.desc.numenorean:0 "To even think that a [ROOT.Char.GetWomanMan] descended from the great men of Númenor would lay with a common peasant is abhorrent."
 flavourevent.0010.desc.normal:0 "The fact is, I barely even go to this village and don't know anyone there. There's no reason why this rumour should exist."
 flavourevent.0010.desc.2:0 "Regardless, all this talk is starting to get out of hand."
 flavourevent.0010.a:0 "There isn't much I can do - these are just vile rumours."

 flavourevent.0011.t:0 "Fury of Durin's Bane"
 flavourevent.0011.desc:0 "It comes with great, lumbering footsteps. A titan of shadow and flame, blade and whip in hand.\n\nDurin's Bane, the [balrog|E], has awoken. It does not take kindly to our intrusion upon [khazaddum|E], and now it lays waste to [targeted_county.GetNameNoTier] with fury and wrath. What do we do?"
 flavourevent.0011.a:0 "We must stand and fight!"
 flavourevent.0011.b:0 "We must retreat!"
 flavourevent.0011.tt.success:0 "You slay Durin's Bane"

 # The Ivory Trader - Thâni-Hazâd area specific flavour event
 flavourevent.0012.t:0 "The Ivory Trader"
 flavourevent.0012.desc:0 "The buzz in [event_county.GetName] quickly reaches my court. Apparently, an ivory trader by the name of [trader.GetName] has set up shop in there, and has quickly gained fame throughout the realm.\n\n[trader.GetHerHis|U] products: goblets, chests, necklaces, and more made supposedly from the highest quality Mûmakil tusks and with utmost craftsmanship adorn the houses of the wealthy and now there is an expectation for me to follow suit.\n\nThe topic is on the lips of many in my court, with some proclaiming that my court would be the envy of the [sevenlands|E]. The product is certainly genuine and unique, and I can't help but wonder if they may be right, yet is it worth the hefty price?"
 flavourevent.0012.a:0 "Quality does not come cheap!"
 flavourevent.0012.b:0 "Try to haggle for a better deal."
 flavourevent.0012.b.tt:0 "You will receive a Court [artifact|E] made out of ivory"
 flavourevent.0012.b.success:0 "Your haggling pays off"

 flavourevent.0012.c:0 "I could use [trader.GetName] in my court."
 flavourevent.0012.d:0 "It's not worth it."

 flavourevent.0013.t:0 "Ancient Gold"
 flavourevent.0013.desc:0 "The news that has arisen from [numenorean_gold_hoard_county.GetName] quickly reaches my ears. A farmer from a rural village had apparently stumbled upon a sizable [numenorean|E] gold hoard, hidden underground for centuries.\n\nMost unfortunately for me, however, the gold also came with an engraved message. It spells out in some ancient tongue the words #italic 'Apho 'lae, ai chennor#!'. While the meaning eludes even the most learned of our scholars, the villagers now believe it to be a warning, and fear that disturbing the gold further would bring upon them a curse.\n\nHow to deal with the situation remains my prerogative."
 flavourevent.0013.a:0 "Nonsense! The gold would serve us well."
 flavourevent.0013.b:0 "Perhaps I could convince them."
 flavourevent.0013.b.success:0 "You convince the villagers that their fears are unfounded"
 flavourevent.0013.b.sucess.toast:0 "The villagers let you have the gold"
 flavourevent.0013.b.failure:0 "You cannot convince the villagers that their fears are unfounded"
 flavourevent.0013.b.failure.toast:0 "The villagers are unconvinced"
 flavourevent.0013.c:0 "Better not to risk it..."
