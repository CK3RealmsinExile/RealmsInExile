 flavourevent.0001.desc.end.evil:0 "It was difficult to describe at first, but finally it became clear - the pained groans of my suffering enemies fill the air, a nectar sweeter than any wine.\n\nThe beating of hammers echo in the background, the heralds of the coming conquest.

 flavourevent.0002.desc.end.evil:0 "At first it was just some mild rustling, but then I heard it - water. Great, unimaginable amounts of water, rushing forth in a torrent that would drown me where I stood. I shook, paralyzed with dread, my heart beating with the force of a hundred drums.

I stumbled over my words as I struggled to recall any details as my servant stood there awkwardly.\n\nWhy is it often too easy to forget what the Master of Desires has shown us in our dreams?"
 flavourevent.0005.a:0 "How irritating. Oh well!"

No of course not, it couldn't have been... or maybe it was....\n\nI force a smile to buy myself time as my brain fails to recall their name."

 # The Ivory Trader - Thani-Hazad area specific flavour event
 flavourevent.0012.t:0 "The Ivory Trader"
 flavourevent.0012.desc:0 "The buzz in [event_county.GetName] quickly reaches my court. Apparently, an ivory trader by the name of [trader.GetName] has set up shop in there, and has quickly gained fame throughout the realm.\n\n[trader.GetHerHis|U] products: goblets, chests, necklaces, and more made supposedly from the highest quality Mûmakil tusks and with utmost craftsmanship adorn the houses of the wealthy and now there is an expectation for me to follow suit.\n\nThe topic is on the lips of many in my court, with some proclaiming that my court would be the envy of the [sevenlands|E]. The product is certainly genuine and unique, and I can't help but wonder if they may be right, yet is it worth the hefty price?"
