 ### Decision-based Events ###
 #Integrate Westmarch
 hobbit.0100.t: "Integrate [GetTitleByKey('c_dunglan').GetNameNoTier]"
 hobbit.0100.desc: "For long years, we [hobbits|E] were content to live within the ancient borders granted to us by the old King at Norbury. But even in the slow-moving [shire|E], things change, and we have begun to feel constrained within the bounds of the old Farthings. Some of the younger Hobbits have even begun to feel adventurous—especially those without land of their own to till—and have drifted west into the fertile country beyond the White Downs.\n\nArmed with ploughs and spades, they have cleared fields and dug new homes in the hillsides, watched over by the White Towers, which, they say, bring them luck. But Hobbits love formality and good order, and petitions have been drawn up calling for this [GetTitleByKey('c_dunglan').GetNameNoTier] to be officially added to the Shire. Now the authority of Thain and Mayor will stretch into this new Farthing… even if, in reality, everyone will carry on with their own business much as before."
 hobbit.0100.a: "For the Westmarch!"
 
 #Integrate Buckland
 hobbit.0101.t: "Integrate [GetTitleByKey('c_buckland').GetNameNoTier]"
 hobbit.0101.desc: "[GetTitleByKey('c_buckland').GetNameNoTier] has always been a strange anomaly—an independent [hobbit|E]-realm outside the ancient [shire|E] borders granted by the King. This has sometimes created difficulties in law and trade, with neither the Thain nor the Mayor always able to exert their rights over the Brandybucks’ strong-willed folk. But times have changed, and it is now accepted that [GetTitleByKey('c_buckland').GetNameNoTier] is, and shall ever be, part of the Shire.\n\nAll that remains is for the papers to be drawn up, sealed, and filed away in the archive at Michel Delving, after which everyone can congratulate themselves on a hard day’s work and retire to the inn for a celebratory feast, with much quaffing of ale. By tomorrow, there’s every chance that everyone will have forgotten that anything was ever any different."
 hobbit.0101.a: "Finally reunited"
 
 #Seize Bag End
 hobbit.0102.t: "Seize Bag End"
 hobbit.0102.desc: "At dawn your banner crests the low green hill above [GetTitleByKey('c_hobbiton').GetNameNoTier]. Your hirelings file into Bag End, fastening iron braces to the lintels and setting grilles to the shutters; the front lawn is swept bare and a short palisade rises. The great parlor is made the your council-chamber, the cellar stacked with arms, the garret set as a watch-post, and sentries pace the ridge of the roof, while patrols move the lanes and a strict curfew falls over the village.\n\nOpen defiance dies quickly, yet in hedged corners and under bowed eaves whisperings of grievance gather, slow and stubborn as roots."
 hobbit.0102.a: "Now we're talking!"

 ### Introduction Events ###

 ### Flavor Events ###
 hobbit.200.t: "An Unthinkable Discovery"
 hobbit.200.desc: "As I peruse the books further back in my library, a green tome catches my eye. It looks quite ancient, and a thin layer of dust obscures its title. As I pick it up and wipe away the dust, I manage to read the faded golden letters:\n\n"ON THE MALADIES OF SECOND BREAKFAST"\n\nThe title is shocking, yet I am compelled to read. Its meaning soon becomes obvious. In it, the author suggests skipping various meals, limiting oneself to only three big meals a day.\n\nHow this book came into my collection I do not know; it is clearly old, and the lettering is faded. Its ideas are very odd, and to many, unthinkable!"
 hobbit.200.a: "I think I'll just put this back"
 hobbit.200.b: "I'll toss this preposterous book into the fire, where it belongs!"
 hobbit.200.c: "I could stand to lose a little weight..."
 hobbit.200.c.success.critical: "Skipping meals does wonders for you."
 hobbit.200.c.success: "You feel slightly better, but it's nothing major."
 hobbit.200.c.failure: "You are left hungry and tired."
 hobbit.200.c.failure.critical: "The drastic change has left you much worse than before."
 hobbit.200.d: "This is revolutionary! I must convince my fellows of the merits of this idea!"
 hobbit.200.d.tt: "This will definitely, most certainly not work."
