 #A Vision Under the Sun
 lotr_khy.0001.t: "A Vision Under the Sun"
 lotr_khy.0001.desc: "I fan myself and drink from a cool glass in order to recieve even the slightest respite from the heat. Sitting upon my throne I find it hard to concentrate, even though an awning casts a cool shadow upon me. My face drips with sweat.\n\nSuddenly the doors to my chamber open, and one of my officials steps forth, with a burnt, half-naked man behind. "My liege, I present [random_mystic.GetName]. It seems he spent a week sitting atop a plateau in the sun, and he claims to have recieved a prophecy from Âzie herself. Whether true or not, his preachings have gathered many followers, including not a few influential ones."\n\nI nod, and look to the mystic. Given that his skin is scarlet, I can certainly believe he spent a considerable amount of time in the sun. Before I can get a word out, he begins his babbling. "It is true -- Effulgent, aflame, glowing -- She spoke to me -- yes -- and she touched me with her flame -- and she said -- and she said that we must prepare, for we will endure great trials -- and the unprepared and unrighteous shall BURN!"\n\nWhile I am...skeptical, to say the least, his words have caught on like wildfire in my lands, and people crowd to catch even a glimpse of him. Perhaps humoring this old man might be for the best."  
 lotr_khy.0001.a: "Ah, what's the worst he can do?"
 lotr_khy.0001.b: "This man has clearly had his brain roasted!"

 #The Quiet Heretic
 lotr_khy.0002.t: "The Heretic"
 lotr_khy.0002.desc: "Word reaches me of an itinerant scholar named [random_preacher.GetName] who has begun preaching in my capital. He questions the supremacy of Âzie’s solar cult, calling for a return to the worship of all the celestial spheres. He first gathered many followers among the countryside, but now his influence is growing among many discontent youth.\n\nHe has grown too influential to ignore. The Blue Sages urge me to suppress him and his views, but there are many who admire his insight, and have grown reverent. I must tread carefully. To strike too hard may grant him martyrdom; to ignore him risks the pernicious seeding of dissent within my own temples."
 lotr_khy.0002.a: "Deal with this heretic!"
 lotr_khy.0002.b: "Invite [random_preacher.GetName] to debate at my court, publicly."

 #The Forgotten Scroll
 lotr_khy.0003.t: "The Forgotten Scroll"
 lotr_khy.0003.desc: "It is a cool evening as I wander the libraries, and my feet take me farther into the back. I am looking for something to read this night, and as I scan the rows and columns of tomes and scrolls, one catches my eye. It seems old, yet even with its age the intricate illuminations are still clear.\n\nPicking it up I see it is called  #EMP The Meditations of the First Dawn#!, yet curiously it is written in an antique form of our script, and most shockingly of all, it is dated to over a century and a half ago. I begin to read it, and quickly come to understand it offers interpretations of Âzie’s nature that diverge sharply from the reformed teachings of Arien-Âzie. It offers many ideas concerning topics from cosmology and eschatology to ritualism, some familiar and some utterly foreign.\n\nWhen I bring it to my scholars, they are quickly divided on it. All outwardly call into question some of its more esoteric ideas, but the hardliners demand it be burned, while those more moderate think it ought to be copied for scholarly purposes."
 lotr_khy.0003.a: "Let's just put it back."
 lotr_khy.0003.b: "Allow scholars to copy and study its contents."
 lotr_khy.0003.c: "Declare the text forbidden and destroy it."

 #Ancient Customs
 lotr_khy.0004.t: "Ancient Customs"
 lotr_khy.0004.desc: "The line of petitioners complaining about their subjects, spouses, livestock, and neighbors marches on. It is midday, and as I dismiss a commoner complaining about his grandmother's friend's nephew's manure pile, a group of peculiar men steps forth, clad in gowns of free-flowing silk in a myriad of bright colors that reach down to their feet.\n\nThey are lead by an old man with a silver beard reaching down to his waist, who wears a speckled cap. He introduces himself as the leader of a large community in rural eastern Khy, and begins his petition.\n\n"It has long been a sacred and holy custom among our people to perform a dawn ride through the winding mountain paths beneath the rising sun, symbolising the soul’s ascent toward Âzie’s light. For many generations, this brought us Her favor, and She blessed us. In recent generations, this dear custom of ours has faded; but most greviously, your officials have banned it entirely." His voice now grew more passionate. "Surely this is an affront to Âzie, and would bring misfortune upon us all! Please, permit us to honor our ancestors and Âzie, and perform it once more, with your gracious blessing".\n\nYet my advisors counsel caution. Many nobles distrust these rugged tribes and their ancient customs, seeing them as heretical and subservient. Would it be better to alienate these people in order to keep the more influential officials happy?"
 lotr_khy.0004.a: "I offer you my blessing to revive this practice."
 lotr_khy.0004.b: "I shall rescind the ban, but nothing more."
 lotr_khy.0004.c: "My officials surely had good reason to outlaw this practice."

 #The Painted Mare
 lotr_khy.0005.t: "The Painted Mares"
 lotr_khy.0005.desc: "A caravan led by the horse-trader [merchant.GetName] has arrived at my court from the east, generating no small amount of commotion; for the reputation of his horses preceeds him. At last I acquiesce to the constant droning of my courtiers, officials, and generals, and decide to finally pay a visit to this [merchant.GetName].\n\nHis stables stink of horse and dung, and flies buzz around in no short notice, but at last he comes up to me and bows. He is dressed in the finest silk, and adorned with gold. That alone gives me an idea of what he might charge me.\n\nHe at last presents the horses, and despite all my reservations, they are truly stunning. Perhaps it is the brown backdrop of the stables, but the horses seem to glow. Their hides are stark white, but patterned with colors ranging from gold to lilac; and they are strong and tall too.\n\nTheir beauty would elevate my grandeur, and their fierceness could turn the tide of battle, but they are certainly not cheap. Ought I spend so freely to chase the winds of the east?" 
 lotr_khy.0005.a: "I must have them!"
 lotr_khy.0005.b: "I'd get a better deal from a bampot with a brush."
 lotr_khy.0005.c: "Let's talk about the price."

 #The Lost Studbook
 lotr_khy.0006.t: "The Lost Studbook"
 lotr_khy.0006.desc: "There is a faint murmur as a group of scholars approach me, carrying on a cushion a weathered old book. According to them it was found in an old ruin, and it is an imperial studbook of Dâtuvahya I himself. Despite its age, it is still impressive; its crimson cover is emblazoned with silver lining and precise golden letters.\n\nIts delicate pages list the finest horses bred in that golden era, complemented by detailed illustrations. Even though these images are faded, the beasts they depict long gone, I cannot but find them impressive.\n\nA thought enters my mind, though it is fanciful. Perhaps, if we interbreed our existing horses in particular ways, we could ressurect these ancient steeds! It would require money, time, and effort, but it is possible." 
 lotr_khy.0006.a: "Summon my horse-breeders at once!"
 lotr_khy.0006.b: "This studbook is valuable on its own."
 lotr_khy.0006.c: "It's interesting, but nothing more."
 lotr_khy.0006.studbook_name: "Dâtuvahya I's studbook"
 lotr_khy.0006.studbook_desc: "The Imperial Studbook is a detailed record of horse breeding within the empire during the early Third Age. Compiled by royal scribes and breeders, it lists the bloodlines, traits, and pedigrees of horses raised for war, ceremony, and travel across the realm.\n\nPage after page records sires, dams, physical characteristics, and lineages once prized by nobles and commanders alike. Many of these bloodlines are extinct, but certain breeders see an opportunity to revive some of these long-lost breeds through careful selective breeding."

 #The Warden’s Penance
 lotr_khy.0008.t: "The Warden’s Penance"
 lotr_khy.0008.desc: "I received word today from the province of [province_scope.GetName], where a temple granary has collapsed. Most peculiarly however, the province administrator [province_ruler.GetName] -- on whom much of the blame has been placed -- has laid aside his garments of office and joined the laborers in repairing the damage.\n\nHe has toiled beneath the sun, garbed in plain linen, refusing even a tent or fine meal. Of course, there are many who praise the deed, but there many among my inner circle who think this hurts the proper governance of [province_scope.GetName], and sets a dangerous precedent. Word of this peculiar display has spread even beyond the province, and there is pressure on me to say something."
 lotr_khy.0008.a: "Publicly praise [province_ruler.GetName]’s penance; let him continue."
 lotr_khy.0008.b: "Command him to resume his rightful duties."
 lotr_khy.0008.c: "Summon him to court for private counsel."

 # An Excess of Frugality
 lotr_khy.0009.t: "An Excess of Frugality"
 lotr_khy.0009.desc: "Word has reached me of a peculiar movement that has seized [random_city.GetName] seemingly overnight. Following a bad harvest, the citizens have begun to clothe themselves in plain tunics and cast away their jewelry and valuables in protest of the excesses of the local administration, and perhaps even my court.\n\nStatues and frescoes have been covered in cloth or paint, and perhaps worst of all, merchants peddling valuable goods have been denied entrance or even physically assaulted. There seems to be no end in sight to this protest of theirs, and if I am to reach the best outcome I must tread carefully.\n\nThe merchants and nobility are of course in almost universal agreement against this movement, but it has garnered sympathizers not just among the peasants but some of the clergy."
 lotr_khy.0009.a: "We feast while they scrape by; perhaps they are right?"
 lotr_khy.0009.b: "I will not tolerate this insolence."
 lotr_khy.0009.c: "I care not."

 lotr_khy.0011.desc: "While foreigners from far abroad, especially merchants, are no strangers in our land, there are times when their presence can cause tensions. It seems this is one of those times. An envoy from [coastal_city.GetName] comprising of nobles, burghers, and clergy alike have arrived at my court, led by a representative of the town administrator.\n\n"Our harbours are nigh unrecognizable! Crime runs rampant, and worst of all, these foreign ships bring corrupting and harmful beliefs and superstitions. Barbarous and strange sailors and merchants tell tales of wicked, foreign gods; and they openly chant hymns in their vile and offputting tongues. This is an affront to Âzie!"\n\nThe zealous in my court demand I expel these foreigners, fearing they shall corrupt the youth, disrupt law and order, and bring down divine wrath. Yet there is no denying these merchants are the lifeblood of many towns, and provide the court with many goods and much gold." 
 lotr_khy.0011.a: "Order the foreigners expelled at once."
 lotr_khy.0011.b: "Permit their presence, but restrict public preaching."
 lotr_khy.0011.c: "Welcome them openly in the spirit of exchange."

 #A Salty Situation
 lotr_khy.0012.t: "A Salty Situation"
 lotr_khy.0012.desc: "What once was a heated, but organized debate has devolved into a raucous, echoing match of personal insults and curses. I wearily turn to my guards, and a few loud stamps cause the room the fall silent. The two sides look upon me intently.\n\nOn the left is a throng nobles, burghers, and peasants alike, all accusing the coastal merchants and magnates of hoarding salt, driving up prices far beyond reason. Without salt, they say, preservation fails, livestock suffers, and common folk starve.\n\nThe merchants, all clad in spotless tunics and patterned trousers, crowd the right of the room. They claim no wrongdoing; the sea gives what it gives, and they have a right to make a profit.\n\nThe tension lies heavily in the air, and at any moment the shouting match could begin anew. The coastal magnates are rich and powerful, and their support might make or break one's rule; but left unchecked, perhaps the entire realm could suffer, and the already deep tensions might be exacerbated. Should I intervene?"
 lotr_khy.0012.a: "Impose fair limits on salt prices across the realm."
 lotr_khy.0012.b: "The sea gives what it gives; it is always right."
 lotr_khy.0012.c: "Surely there is a compromise to be made here."
 lotr_khy.0012.toast.c.success: "You successfully encourage the lords to work together"

 #Rays of Madness

 lotr_khy.0014.desc: "First, there were whispers and rumors, thought to be nothing but inconsequential prattle. Courtiers and servants spoke of a spectre that wandered the halls and corridors at night, cursing passers-by. Then the rumours spread, and I sent my spies at last to investigate. The last thing I want is a ghost in my own home.\n\nIt turns out however this ghost is actually [possessed_consort.GetName], and my spies report she is clearly quite mad. Yet the news grows worse, for now she has begun to claim that she is the mortal reflection of Âzie herself, spreading her light and fire\n\nIn a normal situation she would be cast out of the court, or perhaps even punished, yet it seems [possessed_consort.GetName] has grown quite popular. There are many among my courtiers and servants who bow at her presence and speak words of reverence; whether these are in jest or serious I do not know. If I act rashly, I risk inflaming passions. If I do nothing, her cult may grow unchecked within my walls." 
 lotr_khy.0014.a: "Exile [possessed_consort.GetName] for her dangerous claims."
 lotr_khy.0014.b: "Publicly denounce her words, but allow her to remain."
