 #Vision Under the Noon Sun
 lotr_khy.0001.t: "Vision Under the Noon Sun"
 lotr_khy.0001.desc: "It was on the hottest day in recent memory that the mystic [random_mystic.GetName] stumbled into my court, sun-scorched and trembling. He had wandered alone into the high plateau, seeking communion with the heavens. Now, before my gathered court, he speaks of a vision beneath the blazing noon sun: the form of Âzie herself, cloaked in golden fire, who spoke of a coming time of testing for our people.\n\nWhispers ripple through the palace. The devout call this a blessing; my more cautious advisors urge restraint. A single false prophecy could unsettle the realm. Yet the mystic seems sincere, and I cannot deny the weight of his words." #AIGENERATED 
 lotr_khy.0001.a: "Proclaim the vision as truth to the faithfuls"
 lotr_khy.0001.b: "Order the mystic quietly returned to obscurity"

 #The Quiet Heretic
 lotr_khy.0002.t: "The Quiet Heretic"
 lotr_khy.0002.desc: "For some weeks now, I have heard murmurs of an itinerant scholar named [random_preacher.GetName], who teaches in the shadowed corners of the city. He questions the supremacy of Âzie’s solar cult, urging instead a return to older, broader worship of the celestial spheres. His tone is calm, his speech artful, his influence growing—especially among the young and the restless.\n\nThe Blue Sages urge swift suppression. Yet the people admire his forbearance and insight. I must tread carefully. To strike too hard may grant him martyrdom; to ignore him risks the slow seeding of dissent within my own temples." #AIGENERATED 
 lotr_khy.0002.a: "Dispatch agents to arrest the heretic immediately."
 lotr_khy.0002.b: "Invite [random_preacher.GetName] to debate at my court, publicly."

 #The Forgotten Scroll
 lotr_khy.0003.t: "The Forgotten Scroll"
 lotr_khy.0003.desc: "In the depths of the royal archives, beneath brittle ledgers and faded tomes, a forgotten theological text has surfaced: #EMP The Meditations of the First Dawn#!. Penned centuries ago, it offers interpretations of Âzie’s nature that diverge sharply from the reformed teachings of Arien-Âzie. Its words are serene, its philosophy subtle—yet it speaks of a more cyclical understanding of light and time, one that some might call heretical.\n\nThe scholar who found it now stands before me, eager yet uncertain. The court is divided. Some urge I lock the scroll away; others suggest it might enrich our understanding of the divine. The decision, as ever, rests with me." #AIGENERATED 
 lotr_khy.0003.a: "Seal the scroll once more in the archives."
 lotr_khy.0003.b: "Allow scholars to copy and study its contents."
 lotr_khy.0003.c: "Declare the text forbidden and destroy it."

 #Rider’s Rite of the Mountain Paths
 lotr_khy.0004.t: "Rider’s Rite of the Mountain Paths"
 lotr_khy.0004.desc: "This morning, I was approached by an elder chieftain from the mountain tribes of eastern Khy. He spoke of the Rider’s Rite, a solemn tradition once practiced by his people: a dawn ride through the winding mountain paths beneath the rising sun, symbolising the soul’s ascent toward Âzie’s light.\n\nIn recent generations, the Rite has faded, as stone cities rose and the court grew distant from the highlands. Now the chieftain, his voice rich with memory, asks that I restore its honour and permit tribal riders to perform it once more—openly, with the court’s blessing.\n\nYet my advisors counsel caution. Some inland nobles distrust these rugged tribes and their ancient customs. To embrace the Rite could strengthen ties—or stir unrest among those who see it as backward." #AIGENERATED 
 lotr_khy.0004.a: "Attend the Rider’s Rite myself beneath the mountain sun."
 lotr_khy.0004.b: "Permit the tribes to revive the Rite with my blessing."
 lotr_khy.0004.c: "Politely decline, leaving the Rite to memory."

 #The Painted Mare
 lotr_khy.0005.t: "The Painted Mare"
 lotr_khy.0005.desc: "A caravan from the far eastern plains has arrived at court, led by the merchant [merchant.GetName]. Among his wares are strange and beautiful horses—sleek, swift, and with coats marked in patterns resembling flowing paint. No such breed exists among our stock.\n\nSuch bloodlines could elevate our stables beyond compare. My master of horse urges their acquisition. Yet [merchant.GetName]’s price is steep: not trinkets or favours, but gold—an obscene sum by any measure. My treasurers blanch; the priesthood murmurs of vanity; but my war-leaders see the mares as a prize worth any coin.\n\nNow the matter rests with me. Will I spend so freely to chase the winds of the east?" #AIGENERATED 
 lotr_khy.0005.a: "Pay the merchant’s price and claim the painted mares."
 lotr_khy.0005.b: "Refuse the trade; the treasury must be guarded."
 lotr_khy.0005.c: "Attempt to negotiate a lesser sum."
 lotr_khy.0005.toast.c.success: "You successfully lower the price for the horses"
 lotr_khy.0005.toast.c.failure: "The merchant drives up the price for the horses"
 
 #The Lost Studbook
 lotr_khy.0006.t: "The Lost Studbook"
 lotr_khy.0006.desc: "Word reached me today of a discovery in a ruined archive near the old capital: an imperial studbook from the reign of Dâtuvahya I himself. Its brittle pages list the finest horses bred in that golden era—many bloodlines thought long vanished. Scholars claim that with care, some of these lineages might be revived through careful breeding.\n\nYet there is risk. Pursuing this path would demand great expense and years of patience. Some courtiers scoff, seeing it as vanity. The breeders, however, already dream of restoring the glory of Khy’s legendary steeds. I must decide whether to embrace this vision or let the past remain buried." #AIGENERATED 
 lotr_khy.0006.a: "Fund the revival of these ancient bloodlines."
 lotr_khy.0006.b: "Keep the studbook preserved, but take no action."
 lotr_khy.0006.c: "Publicly dismiss the project as needless folly."
 lotr_khy.0006.studbook_name: "Dâtuvahya I's studbook"
 lotr_khy.0006.studbook_desc: "The Imperial Studbook is a detailed record of horse breeding within the empire during the early Third Age. Compiled by royal scribes and breeders, it lists the bloodlines, traits, and pedigrees of horses raised for war, ceremony, and travel across the realm.\n\nPage after page records sires, dams, physical characteristics, and lineages once prized by nobles and commanders alike. Many of these bloodlines are believed to have dwindled or vanished entirely over the passing centuries.\n\nNow, with its rediscovery, scholars and breeders see an opportunity: through careful selection and investment, it may be possible to revive some of these storied lines and restore a measure of the equine excellence once known to the empire." #AIGENERATED

 #The Warden’s Penance
 lotr_khy.0008.t: "The Warden’s Penance"
 lotr_khy.0008.desc: "I received word today from the province of [province_scope.GetName]. The Administrator of that land, [province_ruler.GetName], has taken an unusual course. After the collapse of a temple granary—a fault many attribute to his neglect—he has laid aside his garments of office and joined the laborers repairing the damage.\n\nFor weeks now, he toils beneath the sun, garbed in plain linen, refusing even a tent or fine meal. Some call it a noble display of forbearance; others deem it an affront to the dignity of his rank. Now his stewards beg me to intervene. Should I let his penance continue or restore him to his post?" #AIGENERATED 
 lotr_khy.0008.a: "Publicly praise [province_ruler.GetName]’s penance; let him continue."
 lotr_khy.0008.b: "Command him to resume his rightful duties."
 lotr_khy.0008.c: "Summon him to court for private counsel."

 #Sackcloth and Statues
 lotr_khy.0009.t: "Sackcloth and Statues"
 lotr_khy.0009.desc: "A curious report from the inland city of [random_city.GetName]: in silent protest of courtly excess, the citizens have clothed themselves in sackcloth and turned away from luxury. Statues and fountains stand draped in rough cloth; market stalls refuse to sell jewels or silks. It is a year of public humility, led not by fanatics but by the common folk.\n\nTheir message is clear: the court has grown too rich while they grow weary. Yet some nobles view this act as dangerous dissent. Others call it a mirror to our own failings. How I respond may shape the realm’s spirit for years to come." #AIGENERATED 
 lotr_khy.0009.a: "Praise the city’s humility and heed its message."
 lotr_khy.0009.b: "Condemn the protest and order its end."
 lotr_khy.0009.c: "Quietly observe, taking no official stance."

 #Tide of Foreigners
 lotr_khy.0011.t: "Tide of Foreigners"
 lotr_khy.0011.desc: "News reaches me from the coastal city of [coastal_city.GetName]. The harbor teems with sailors from distant shores, their ships heavy with spices, fabrics—and strange new beliefs. In taverns and temples alike, tales of foreign gods and unseen heavens mingle with our own hymns to Âzie.\n\nNow inland nobles, ever wary of the sea’s fickle influence, demand I expel these foreigners before their words corrupt the faithful. Coastal merchants, meanwhile, urge tolerance, citing the wealth this trade brings. My decision must balance gold and faith, sea and stone." #AIGENERATED 
 lotr_khy.0011.a: "Order the foreigners expelled at once."
 lotr_khy.0011.b: "Permit their presence, but restrict public preaching."
 lotr_khy.0011.c: "Welcome them openly in the spirit of exchange."

 #Salt in the Citadel
 lotr_khy.0012.t: "Salt in the Citadel"
 lotr_khy.0012.desc: "The halls of my citadel echo with sharp voices. A delegation of inland nobles accuses the coastal merchants of hoarding salt and sea-goods, driving up prices far beyond reason. Without salt, they say, preservation fails, livestock suffers, and common folk starve.\n\nThe merchants reply with calm arrogance: the market speaks, and the sea yields as it will. Yet tension grows. If left unchecked, this quarrel may spark deeper rifts between my coastal ports and inland strongholds. The question falls to me: intervene, or let the market run its course?" #AIGENERATED 
 lotr_khy.0012.a: "Impose fair limits on salt prices across the realm."
 lotr_khy.0012.b: "Permit the market to settle matters naturally."
 lotr_khy.0012.c: "Summon coastal and inland leaders to negotiate terms."
 lotr_khy.0012.toast.c.success: "You successfully encourage the lords to work together"

 #The Sun’s Reflection
 lotr_khy.0014.t: "The Sun’s Reflection"
 lotr_khy.0014.desc: "A troubling murmur rises within my own palace. The young consort [possessed_consort.GetName] has begun claiming that she is the mortal reflection of Âzie herself—chosen to walk in the goddess’s light and shadow. Her presence draws fervent followers among servants and lesser courtiers.\n\nYet her rivals bristle with outrage, declaring her words dangerous heresy. They demand her exile—or worse. The priests remain divided; some fear to defy her, while others call her blasphemous. If I act rashly, I risk inflaming passions. If I do nothing, her cult may grow unchecked within my walls." #AIGENERATED 
 lotr_khy.0014.a: "Exile [possessed_consort.GetName] for her dangerous claims."
 lotr_khy.0014.b: "Publicly denounce her words, but allow her to remain."
