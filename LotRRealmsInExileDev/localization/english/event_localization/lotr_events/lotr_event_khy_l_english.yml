### Khyan Flavour Events ###
 #A Vision Under the Sun
 lotr_khy.0001.t: "A Vision Under the Sun"
 lotr_khy.0001.desc: "I fan myself and drink from a cool glass in order to recieve even the slightest respite from the heat. Sitting upon my throne I find it hard to concentrate, even though an awning casts a cool shadow upon me. My face drips with sweat.\n\nSuddenly the doors to my chamber open, and one of my officials steps forth, with a burnt, half-naked man behind. "My liege, I present [random_mystic.GetName]. It seems he spent a week sitting atop a plateau in the sun, and he claims to have recieved a prophecy from Âzie herself. Whether true or not, his preachings have gathered many followers, including not a few influential ones."\n\nI nod, and look to the mystic. Given that his skin is scarlet, I can certainly believe he spent a considerable amount of time in the sun. Before I can get a word out, he begins his babbling. "It is true -- Effulgent, aflame, glowing -- She spoke to me -- yes -- and she touched me with her flame -- and she said -- and she said that we must prepare, for we will endure great trials -- and the unprepared and unrighteous shall BURN!"\n\nWhile I am...skeptical, to say the least, his words have caught on like wildfire in my lands, and people crowd to catch even a glimpse of him. Perhaps humoring this old man might be for the best."  
 lotr_khy.0001.a: "Ah, what's the worst he can do?"
 lotr_khy.0001.b: "This man has clearly had his brain roasted!"

 #The Quiet Heretic
 lotr_khy.0002.t: "The Heretic"
 lotr_khy.0002.desc: "Word reaches me of an itinerant scholar named [random_preacher.GetName] who has begun preaching in my capital. He questions the supremacy of Âzie’s solar cult, calling for a return to the worship of all the celestial spheres. He first gathered many followers among the countryside, but now his influence is growing among many discontent youth.\n\nHe has grown too influential to ignore. The Blue Sages urge me to suppress him and his views, but there are many who admire his insight, and have grown reverent. I must tread carefully. To strike too hard may grant him martyrdom; to ignore him risks the pernicious seeding of dissent within my own temples."
 lotr_khy.0002.a: "Deal with this heretic!"
 lotr_khy.0002.b: "Invite [random_preacher.GetName] to debate at my court, publicly."
 lotr_khy.0002.b.success: ""
 lotr_khy.0002.toast.b.success: "You win the debate against [random_preacher.GetName]"

 #The Forgotten Scroll
 lotr_khy.0003.t: "The Forgotten Scroll"
 lotr_khy.0003.desc: "It is a cool evening as I wander the libraries, and my feet take me farther into the back. I am looking for something to read this night, and as I scan the rows and columns of tomes and scrolls, one catches my eye. It seems old, yet even with its age the intricate illuminations are still clear.\n\nPicking it up I see it is called  #EMP The Meditations of the First Dawn#!, yet curiously it is written in an antique form of our script, and most shockingly of all, it is dated to over a century and a half ago. I begin to read it, and quickly come to understand it offers interpretations of Âzie’s nature that diverge sharply from the reformed teachings of Arien-Âzie. It offers many ideas concerning topics from cosmology and eschatology to ritualism, some familiar and some utterly foreign.\n\nWhen I bring it to my scholars, they are quickly divided on it. All outwardly call into question some of its more esoteric ideas, but the hardliners demand it be burned, while those more moderate think it ought to be copied for scholarly purposes."
 lotr_khy.0003.a: "Let's just put it back."
 lotr_khy.0003.b: "Allow scholars to copy and study its contents."
 lotr_khy.0003.c: "Declare the text forbidden and destroy it."

 #Ancient Customs
 lotr_khy.0004.t: "Ancient Customs"
 lotr_khy.0004.desc: "The line of petitioners complaining about their subjects, spouses, livestock, and neighbors marches on. It is midday, and as I dismiss a commoner complaining about his grandmother's friend's nephew's manure pile, a group of peculiar men steps forth, clad in gowns of free-flowing silk in a myriad of bright colors that reach down to their feet.\n\nThey are lead by an old man with a silver beard reaching down to his waist, who wears a speckled cap. He introduces himself as the leader of a large community in rural eastern Khy, and begins his petition.\n\n"It has long been a sacred and holy custom among our people to perform a dawn ride through the winding mountain paths beneath the rising sun, symbolising the soul’s ascent toward Âzie’s light. For many generations, this brought us Her favor, and She blessed us. In recent generations, this dear custom of ours has faded; but most greviously, your officials have banned it entirely." His voice now grew more passionate. "Surely this is an affront to Âzie, and would bring misfortune upon us all! Please, permit us to honor our ancestors and Âzie, and perform it once more, with your gracious blessing".\n\nYet my advisors counsel caution. Many nobles distrust these rugged tribes and their ancient customs, seeing them as heretical and subservient. Would it be better to alienate these people in order to keep the more influential officials happy?"
 lotr_khy.0004.a: "I offer you my blessing to revive this practice."
 lotr_khy.0004.b: "I shall rescind the ban, but nothing more."
 lotr_khy.0004.c: "My officials surely had good reason to outlaw this practice."

 #The Painted Mare
 lotr_khy.0005.t: "The Painted Mares"
 lotr_khy.0005.desc: "A caravan led by the horse-trader [merchant.GetName] has arrived at my court from the east, generating no small amount of commotion; for the reputation of his horses preceeds him. At last I acquiesce to the constant droning of my courtiers, officials, and generals, and decide to finally pay a visit to this [merchant.GetName].\n\nHis stables stink of horse and dung, and flies buzz around in no short notice, but at last he comes up to me and bows. He is dressed in the finest silk, and adorned with gold. That alone gives me an idea of what he might charge me.\n\nHe at last presents the horses, and despite all my reservations, they are truly stunning. Perhaps it is the brown backdrop of the stables, but the horses seem to glow. Their hides are stark white, but patterned with colors ranging from gold to lilac; and they are strong and tall too.\n\nTheir beauty would elevate my grandeur, and their fierceness could turn the tide of battle, but they are certainly not cheap. Ought I spend so freely to chase the winds of the east?" 
 lotr_khy.0005.a: "I must have them!"
 lotr_khy.0005.b: "I'd get a better deal from a bampot with a brush."
 lotr_khy.0005.c: "Let's talk about the price."
 lotr_khy.0005.toast.c.success: "You successfully lower the price for the horses"
 lotr_khy.0005.toast.c.failure: "The merchant drives up the price for the horses"
 
 #The Lost Studbook
 lotr_khy.0006.t: "The Lost Studbook"
 lotr_khy.0006.desc: "There is a faint murmur as a group of scholars approach me, carrying on a cushion a weathered old book. According to them it was found in an old ruin, and it is an imperial studbook of Dâtuvahya I himself. Despite its age, it is still impressive; its crimson cover is emblazoned with silver lining and precise golden letters.\n\nIts delicate pages list the finest horses bred in that golden era, complemented by detailed illustrations. Even though these images are faded, the beasts they depict long gone, I cannot but find them impressive.\n\nA thought enters my mind, though it is fanciful. Perhaps, if we interbreed our existing horses in particular ways, we could ressurect these ancient steeds! It would require money, time, and effort, but it is possible." 
 lotr_khy.0006.a: "Summon my horse-breeders at once!"
 lotr_khy.0006.b: "This studbook is valuable on its own."
 lotr_khy.0006.c: "It's interesting, but nothing more."
 lotr_khy.0006.studbook_name: "Dâtuvahya I's studbook"
 lotr_khy.0006.studbook_desc: "The Imperial Studbook is a detailed record of horse breeding within the empire during the early Third Age. Compiled by royal scribes and breeders, it lists the bloodlines, traits, and pedigrees of horses raised for war, ceremony, and travel across the realm.\n\nPage after page records sires, dams, physical characteristics, and lineages once prized by nobles and commanders alike. Many of these bloodlines are extinct, but certain breeders see an opportunity to revive some of these long-lost breeds through careful selective breeding."

 #The Warden’s Penance
 lotr_khy.0008.t: "The Warden’s Penance"
 lotr_khy.0008.desc: "I received word today from the province of [province_scope.GetName], where a temple granary has collapsed. Most peculiarly however, the province administrator [province_ruler.GetName] -- on whom much of the blame has been placed -- has laid aside his garments of office and joined the laborers in repairing the damage.\n\nHe has toiled beneath the sun, garbed in plain linen, refusing even a tent or fine meal. Of course, there are many who praise the deed, but there many among my inner circle who think this hurts the proper governance of [province_scope.GetName], and sets a dangerous precedent. Word of this peculiar display has spread even beyond the province, and there is pressure on me to say something."
 lotr_khy.0008.a: "Publicly praise [province_ruler.GetName]’s penance; let him continue."
 lotr_khy.0008.b: "Command him to resume his rightful duties."
 lotr_khy.0008.c: "Summon him to court for private counsel."

 # An Excess of Frugality
 lotr_khy.0009.t: "An Excess of Frugality"
 lotr_khy.0009.desc: "Word has reached me of a peculiar movement that has seized [random_city.GetName] seemingly overnight. Following a bad harvest, the citizens have begun to clothe themselves in plain tunics and cast away their jewelry and valuables in protest of the excesses of the local administration, and perhaps even my court.\n\nStatues and frescoes have been covered in cloth or paint, and perhaps worst of all, merchants peddling valuable goods have been denied entrance or even physically assaulted. There seems to be no end in sight to this protest of theirs, and if I am to reach the best outcome I must tread carefully.\n\nThe merchants and nobility are of course in almost universal agreement against this movement, but it has garnered sympathizers not just among the peasants but some of the clergy."
 lotr_khy.0009.a: "We feast while they scrape by; perhaps they are right?"
 lotr_khy.0009.b: "I will not tolerate this insolence."
 lotr_khy.0009.c: "I care not."

 #Tide of Foreigners
 lotr_khy.0011.t: "Tide of Foreigners"
 lotr_khy.0011.desc: "While foreigners from far abroad, especially merchants, are no strangers in our land, there are times when their presence can cause tensions. It seems this is one of those times. An envoy from [coastal_city.GetName] comprising of nobles, burghers, and clergy alike have arrived at my court, led by a representative of the town administrator.\n\n"Our harbours are nigh unrecognizable! Crime runs rampant, and worst of all, these foreign ships bring corrupting and harmful beliefs and superstitions. Barbarous and strange sailors and merchants tell tales of wicked, foreign gods; and they openly chant hymns in their vile and offputting tongues. This is an affront to Âzie!"\n\nThe zealous in my court demand I expel these foreigners, fearing they shall corrupt the youth, disrupt law and order, and bring down divine wrath. Yet there is no denying these merchants are the lifeblood of many towns, and provide the court with many goods and much gold." 
 lotr_khy.0011.a: "Order the foreigners expelled at once."
 lotr_khy.0011.b: "Permit their presence, but restrict public preaching."
 lotr_khy.0011.c: "Welcome them openly in the spirit of exchange."

 #A Salty Situation
 lotr_khy.0012.t: "A Salty Situation"
 lotr_khy.0012.desc: "What once was a heated, but organized debate has devolved into a raucous, echoing match of personal insults and curses. I wearily turn to my guards, and a few loud stamps cause the room the fall silent. The two sides look upon me intently.\n\nOn the left is a throng nobles, burghers, and peasants alike, all accusing the coastal merchants and magnates of hoarding salt, driving up prices far beyond reason. Without salt, they say, preservation fails, livestock suffers, and common folk starve.\n\nThe merchants, all clad in spotless tunics and patterned trousers, crowd the right of the room. They claim no wrongdoing; the sea gives what it gives, and they have a right to make a profit.\n\nThe tension lies heavily in the air, and at any moment the shouting match could begin anew. The coastal magnates are rich and powerful, and their support might make or break one's rule; but left unchecked, perhaps the entire realm could suffer, and the already deep tensions might be exacerbated. Should I intervene?"
 lotr_khy.0012.a: "Impose fair limits on salt prices across the realm."
 lotr_khy.0012.b: "The sea gives what it gives; it is always right."
 lotr_khy.0012.c: "Surely there is a compromise to be made here."
 lotr_khy.0012.toast.c.success: "You successfully encourage the lords to work together"
 lotr_khy.0012.toast.c.failure: "You fail to make the lords work together"

 #Rays of Madness
 lotr_khy.0014.t: "Rays of Madness"
 lotr_khy.0014.desc: "First, there were whispers and rumors, thought to be nothing but inconsequential prattle. Courtiers and servants spoke of a spectre that wandered the halls and corridors at night, cursing passers-by. Then the rumours spread, and I sent my spies at last to investigate. The last thing I want is a ghost in my own home.\n\nIt turns out however this ghost is actually [possessed_consort.GetName], and my spies report she is clearly quite mad. Yet the news grows worse, for now she has begun to claim that she is the mortal reflection of Âzie herself, spreading her light and fire.\n\nIn a normal situation she would be cast out of the court, or perhaps even punished, yet it seems [possessed_consort.GetName] has grown quite popular. There are many among my courtiers and servants who bow at her presence and speak words of reverence; whether these are in jest or serious I do not know. If I act rashly, I risk inflaming passions. If I do nothing, her cult may grow unchecked within my walls." 
 lotr_khy.0014.a: "Exile [possessed_consort.GetName] for her dangerous claims."
 lotr_khy.0014.b: "Publicly denounce her words, but allow her to remain."

### Vasnan Events ###
 # The Vasnan Faction — A second part to the Vasnan intro event
 lotr_khy.0100.t: "The Vasnan Faction"
 lotr_khy.0100.desc: "[GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofvasnan22').GetFirstNameNoTooltip], alongside his adult son and heir [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofvasnan42').GetFirstNameNoTooltip] worked to leverage the already vast influence of the [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofvasnan42').GetDynastyHouseName] into an independent political faction. Though they tried to re-ingratiate themselves with the [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineoftirdahan7').GetDynastyHouseName], they were unwilling to accept the Vasnan attempts to bridge the gap, and so personal emnity and political dissonance grew further and further until there was nothing but hatred between them.\n\nThe [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofdelawarhan97').GetDynastyHouseName] of [GetTitleByKey('k_ashanur').GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] and the resurgent [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofemetez53').GetDynastyHouseName] of [GetTitleByKey('d_jorash').GetNameNoTier] have joined our cause, with many smaller lords such as the [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofrakhohan19').GetDynastyHouseName] and [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofdelsuzan7').GetDynastyHouseName] also on our side, nearly the whole south and west are with us.\n\nA few houses still hold out undecided, such as the [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofaspantamana68').GetDynastyHouseName] upon the frontiers or the newly established [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofwehzanez43').GetDynastyHouseName], we must strive to convince them, should we wish to see Khy under a friendly dynasty once again, or perhaps even our own.\n\nPerhaps it shall start by forcing cousin [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofvasnan36').GetFirstName] to pick a side."
 lotr_khy.0100.a: "The Age of the Vasnans, the age of my rule is nigh."
 lotr_khy.0100.b: "So long as caution is employed, naught shall stand in our way."
 lotr_khy.0100.tt: "You will move to revoke [GetTitleByKey('c_meherafrin').GetName] from [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofvasnan36').GetFirstName]'s cousin [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofvasnan37').GetFirstName]"

 # A Brother Bereft — Ashtad Response to the Revocation of Meherafrin
 lotr_khy.0101.t: "A Brother Bereft"
 lotr_khy.0101.desc: "I was enjoying a fine evening meal with my family and much wine when one of my servants interrupted. The man had a look of shock on his face, and so I encouraged him to spit it out, and he did, my brother Nashak was here.\n\nSurprised by the visit and why it would give such a look of shock to my servant, I went to meet him, only to see that he was wet from head to toe, bringing many possesions and servants with him.\n\nWhen he saw me, he looked at me as if I were his savior, grabbing me by the arm and saying 'Brother! Jahanabad has taken the land of our father, the land you entrusted me with!'\n\nIt seems I am faced with a grave decision."
 lotr_khy.0101.a: "Jahanabad will return Meherafrin to Nashak."
 lotr_khy.0101.b: "What do I care of Meherafrin."

 # A Cousin's Complaint — Vasnan Choice to Keep or Return Meherafrin
 lotr_khy.0102.t: "A Cousin's Complaint"
 lotr_khy.0102.desc: "I knew that this response might happen, I planned for it, in fact. Ashtad has written me, demanding that I return the lands of his father to his brother Nashak.\n\nOn one hand, Ashtad does control the fairly prosperous lands of Naishan, and is a man likely to be quite pleased he managed to convince me to change my mind, so giving it back could be worthwhile, especially as childless Nashak is likely to pick one of my sons as his heir.\n\nOn the other hand, the revenue from the lands of Meherafrin would be very useful in my disputes with the Tirdâhan."
 lotr_khy.0102.a: "Why of course dear cousin, I will return Meherafrin to Nashak..."
 lotr_khy.0102.b: "Ashtad's rage is not something to fear, nor his favour something to desire."

 # An Heir-ly Decision — Meherafrin Vasnan Heir Choice
 lotr_khy.0103.t: "An Heir-ly Decision"
 lotr_khy.0103.desc: "I am an old man, without children and uninterested in producing them, therefore, I must pick a child from amongst my relatives as my heir.\n\nThe first option is Nekchehr, eldest son of my liege, Jahanabad. He is the most likely to have presumed himself heir already, and the most likely to hate me for not picking him. On the other hand, he is not good material for a ruler, for the people of Meherafrin.\n\nJahanabad's other son is also an option, and though he will not be as thrilled by my selection of Adarcher, he will accept it.\n\nI might also choose my young grand-nephew Tahm and keep Meherafrin in the hands of the descendants of my father."
 lotr_khy.0103.a: "Nekchehr will suffice."
 lotr_khy.0103.b: "Perhaps Adarcher can be molded into a good leader."
 lotr_khy.0103.c: "Tahm is the perfect heir."

 # A Rational Cousin — Ashtad Informed About Success
 lotr_khy.0104.t: "A Rational Cousin"
 lotr_khy.0104.desc: "News has arrived, and it is what I had hoped to hear! Jahanabad has graciously agreed to give Meherafrin back, explaining that it was merely a simple misunderstanding that led to its revocation in the first place!\n\nAs Narshak prepared to return, I quickly throw a celebration–goodbye-party for him. I knew that Jahanabad would see reason, after all."
 lotr_khy.0104.a: "A toast to that!"

 # To Despise or Forget — Ashtad Grudge Choice
 lotr_khy.0105.t: "To Despise or Forget"
 lotr_khy.0105.desc: "News has arrived, and it is not what I had hoped to hear... Jahanabad has refused to give Meherafrin back to Nashak. There is naught that I can do to force him, and so Nashak will remain in my court, regretting the loss of our father's lands.\n\nAll there is left to decide is, do I care that he refused me?"
 lotr_khy.0105.a: "Jahanabad will not get away with this."
 lotr_khy.0105.b: "I learn to live with his decision."

 # To Step Into the Fray — Ashtad Break with Vasnan Choice
 lotr_khy.0106.t: "To Step Into the Fray"
 lotr_khy.0106.desc: "For a long time, I have sufferend under the yoke of my family and their feuds with the Tirdâhan. Yes, there has been some benefit to me, but much drawback too.\n\nI cannot get over what I learned Jahanabad did last week, I have stewed on it the whole time, he went too far. I need to find something I can do to damage him, to damage his reputation, to damage his power... what could it be?"
 lotr_khy.0106.a: "I will help the Tirdâhan the best way I can!"
 lotr_khy.0106.b: "I will no longer be a Vasnan."

This monumental failure only further cemented the $emperor_administrative_khy$'s dwindling reputation, and more and more of the vassals of the realm have flocked to the [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofvasnan42').GetDynastyHouseName] cause, forseeing power and reward.\n\nNow [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofvasnan42').GetName] sits on the Khjana Throne in [GetTitleByKey('c_west_samarth').GetNameNoTier], ignoring the decrees of his liege, and the realm moves ever closer to open war."

 lotr_khy.0300.desc: "As dawn breaks, the sunlight spilling over the decks of the Bloody Mahin, we catch our first glimpse of Emelkyn, the Spire of Watch towering over the forested shores of Shayn, a mighty beacon guarding the mouth of the Bay of Ormal. The sight of it sends shivers down my spine, this is a place I've only heard of in the tales of old seamen, but none of the yarns they span ever quite captured the sheer #italic height#! of the sapphire spire.\n\nOur approach to the harbour continues uneventfully, the waters are calm and the wind in our sails true. As we weigh our anchor at the quay, we make sure to hide any distinguishing sign of the piratical nature of our vessel. Content with our preparations, we head for the nearest tavern, a rather dilapidated old shack, its wooden beams bent with age. We have arrived in Ormal, our long-lost home, it is only fitting that we had a taste of it for ourselves!"

 # Tavern Tales
 lotr_khy.0301.t: "Tavern Tales"
 lotr_khy.0301.desc: "As I awake to find myself laying in a half-drunken stupor on top of a tavern table, I notice a strange figure sidling up to me. He claims to have listened to me bragging about my piratical exploits last night and that while everyone else there dismissed my tales of daring do as the fanciful ramblings of a drunk, there's something about me that caught his eye.\n\n#EMP 'It has been centuries since your kind sailed these waters, I never thought we'd see the day! I have, in my possession, an ancient almanac written by the famed Apayrabande [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'lineoftwilightpirate0' ).GetFirstName] Janez which speaks of the treasure-hoard of Nhazadh Ahraser, an ancient ruler of Harshandatt, impossibly wealthy! I myself am too old to search for it, but if you agree to let me come along for the ride, any treasure we find is yours!'#!\n\nA most intriguing prospect indeed but do I trust this old man? He doesn't seem like a threat, but looks can be deceiving. Welcoming him onboard my ship could attract unwanted attention and may have unforseen consequences..."
 lotr_khy.0301.a: "A quest for treasure worthy of the Apayrabandâ!"
 lotr_khy.0301.a.tt: "You will attempt to find scattered pieces of a treasure map using the almanac"
 lotr_khy.0301.b: "Bah, such tales of buried hoards are nothing but fairytales."

 lotr_khy.0303.t: "Another Day, another Port"
 lotr_khy.0303.tul_harar.desc: "Tûl Harar! Pearl of cities! Not a completely accurate description, of course — it is not round and shiny — but even its worst enemies would agree that if you had to liken Tûl Harar to anything, then it might as well be a piece of rubbish covered with the diseased secretions of a dying mollusc. Possibly the oldest port city on the shores of Ormal, although it may once have been grand and impressive, it has certainly seen better days. While the spires and domes of hundreds of different temples in dozens of architectural styles to every god on the Bay pierce the skyline, the common buildings along the riverbank speak of abject squalor and the river itself is thick with refuse washed away from the cities upriver.\n\nAnchor weighed, making especially sure to set my most trusted men to guard the ship, I proceed to the humble temple of obscure god Syrsem as the almanac instructs. Going inside, I immediately head for the storeroom and at its dusty rear find what I'm after, an old metal chest with no lock and a skull and crossbones painted on it. I open up the chest..."
 lotr_khy.0303.pyrador.desc: "Pyrador! Now we're #italic really#! getting somewhere! If on a quest for a Nhazadh's treasure, it just #italic makes sense#! to search for clues in Harshandatt's foremost port. When I arrive, however, I am more than a little disappointed. There are docks, yes, but the city is not the vibrant display of Muranian wealth that I expected, not in the least. It is a humble coastal settlement, barely more than a village, and the ruins scattered around don't much resemble what I'd been told the Muranian wonders look like very much at all. I suppose that was to be expected, really. It sems Pyrador is merely a transfer station where goods are unloaded from the river barges of the Núar onto the seagoing ships of the traders on the Bay of Ormal.\n\nMy instructions don't lead to a place within Pyrador itself, but rather have me heading off down the coast on foot to the even smaller town of Aphredîn. The walk along the beach is nice. the sun is shining overhead and a cool sea breeze tempers its heat, although it would be a great deal more pleasant if I actually had #italic ten#! toes to feel the sand between!\n\nArriving in Aphredîn, I ask to speak to the local mayor. It takes a bit of coercion with my cutlass, but he eventually agrees to let me into the town's vault. Sure enough, inside is a aged letter, sealed with a seal depicted in the almanac. I break it open...#
 lotr_khy.0303.mejha.desc: "The next stop on my journey is Mejha, the former capital of the Mejhanian Kingdom of the now collapsed Harshandatt. Although separated by thousands of years from that ancient Nhazadh whose treasure I seek, the distinctive monolithic Harshandattan style of the city and the great palace that domineers over it makes my heart race, eluding to the fortune that may yet be mine!\n\nThe city's enormous stone buildings are interspersed with spatious and well maintained gardens, made possible by the lucrative Kjhana trade from the highlands. Luckily enough for me, the almanac #italic isn't#! sending me to an unsavoury place #italic this time#!, but rather for a pleasurable stroll around one such garden!\n\nUnfortunately, the experience isn't quite as nice as I would've liked. Not for any fault of the garden itself, but because the darned almanac instructs me to start #italic digging#!! I feel incredibly self-conscious as I root around in a particularly pretty flowerbed, conspicuous as I am with my pegleg and eyepatch, well aware that this is rather inappropriate behaviour for someone who doesn't look the least bit like a gardener. At last, I strike something hard with my rusty trowel, a box! Brushing off the dirt, I see that it is stamped just as the almanac indicates it should be! I open it up..."
 lotr_khy.0303.samarth.desc: "Sammar, gateway to Khy, is a city of two halves. On the west side, a vast array of docks and wharfs, sturdy and robust, an engine of prosperity and commerce. The east side has a less savoury reputation, owing to the labyrinthine slums that used to dominate it. A massive bridge spans between the two, an architectural marvel only possible thanks to the combined efforts of the greatest empire this corner of the world has ever seen.\n\nBut I am not here to sight-see, I am here on a quest! The Bloody Mahin safely moored in the High Port, I make for the city's catacombs. A city so large as this could ill-afford to bury their mummies beyond the walls, so the only option was to put them #italic beneath the streets#!. The delving of these catacombs also provided a convenient source of building material for further construction. Entering the catacombs is easy enough, a beautiful edifice welcomes visitors looking to honour the dead, and guards keep oil-lamps lit for the first mile or so but as we press deeper all traces of the outside world disappear. It would be easy to get lost in here, perhaps forever. At last we reach the tomb of Khushnawaz the Cooper. Hidden around the side of the rather small coffin is a piece of paper..."
 lotr_khy.0303.kantilya.desc: "The Bulchyadean city of Kantilya is, allegedly, the city that my distant ancestors first set off from to seak their fame and fortune on the high seas, so this #italic ought#! to feel like a homecoming of sorts. Take a moment to sit on the edge of a pier gazing out towards the sea, as my forefathers must surely have done on countless occasions. What is this life that I have? Forever on the run in a ship increasingly held together by bodge-jobs and hope, Captain of a dwindling crew, the last of the Brotherhood. I have neither fame nor fortune, and while those may await me on my present quest, if they yet ellude me what will I have left? One eye, one leg, and the shattered and broken dreams of generations past. Is it worth it to continue like this? Would it be better just to settle down on dry land, forsaking the sea that I have held so dear? Thankfully, I catch myself before I get too deep and introspective. I have a job to do and treasure to seek! My instructions tell me to head for an old pawnshop called 'Rakhshandeh's Cash for Tat'. Hopefully the map fragment is still there after all these decades..."
 lotr_khy.0303.jorash.desc: "The Bloody Mahin pulls into the port of Jorash, once the capital of the Bulchyadean League before it was subsumed into imperial Khy. The Bulchyades could never quite match up to Anarikê, but they were proud once. Now, they are but coastal provinces of the Khyan empire, denied their ancient prestige. All around us are signs of that ancient maritime heritage and the prosperity of years gone by. It is sad, really, that my ancestral homeland should have fallen so far.\n\nHandily the almanac came with a #italic map#! to this map fragment. Why Janez had to make the hunt quite so convoluted I really can't understand. The map to a map leads me to an old smugglers cave, the inside decorated with faded Apayrabandâ symbols. Being in a place like this feels strange. The whole point of this voyage was to come home, but the weight of the past is overbearing. Everywhere I look, I can't help but imagine others just like me going about their piratical lives. I imagine they must have been far more hopeful then than I am now. The goods once stored here are long-gone, but there #italic is#! an empty amphora of wine sitting in the corner. Well, hopefully #italic not#! an #italic empty#! amphora..."
 lotr_khy.0303.kandalar.desc: "Kandalar is the easternmost Bulchyadean city and has seen its fair share of conflict in years not too long gone. Border skirmishes between Khy and Côdyan-controlled Anarikê necessitated the fortification of this city to control the eastern frontier, and after Anarikê's recent independence it has become home to a sizeable portion of the Khyan imperial fleets. Thankfully, things are relatively calm as we make our visit to this port, with Anarikê independent but still acknowledging the Khyan Rashânashân's suzerainty, making armed conflict unlikely.\n\nTaking a few of my best men with me, we make our way towards the gatehouse. We politely greet the guards, who look utterly bemused at our haphazard attire. Once inside the city, we wait until nightfall before silently breaking into the gatehouse itself. Our objective is to reach the top of the western tower. There is only one sentinel on duty tonight, as luck would have it. He is handily distracted by my men causing a ruckus in the marketplace and abandons his post. I throw a rope over the side of the tower and haul myself up. At the top, pressed deep into a crack between two stones of the parapet, is an envelope. I dig it out with the tip of my cutlass."
 lotr_khy.0303.narikhar.desc: "Anarikê's capital, Narikhar, is home to the largest fleet of ships I have ever set my eyes upon, and that's saying something, considering I've payed visits to the mighty havens of the #italic Vûlmaw#!! Star-emblazoned banners flutter at the masts of rank upon rank of ships which looks just as fit for war as for maritime trade. It is plain to see why Anarikê's unwilling union with Côdya and then its fleet's subsequent subjugation to the needs of the Khyan crown spelt inescapable doom for we Apayrabandâ in the waters of our youth. The scale of this armada shakes me to my core. If I were to endeavour to revive my Brotherhood, it would not be at all easy to contend with Anarikê's naval might on the high seas.\n\nDisembarking, I make my way towards the palace's storehouses. At first, the lone guard refuses to let me in, but my cutlass handily persuades the clearly unexperienced recruit that maybe his duties aren't so important after all. Making my way to the cellars, the sight of so much food makes me ravenous, so I help myself to just a little cured meat from the racks. In the cellar, I find what I'm looking for, an aged barrel marked 'For a Rainy Day'."
 lotr_khy.0303.inyaloni.desc: "Arriving in Inyalôni, second city of Anarikê, my first impression is that somehow everything is just a little too #italic big#!. The proportions are all wrong, as if every structure were built for beings at least two heads taller than the common man. #italic Everything#! in the city's core is #italic big#!, contrasting greatly with the more normal-looking buildings on the outskirts that we passed on our way into the harbour. Who could have built such structures, and why? The locals look to be mere [men|E] just as I am! I gather that these buildings must be incredibly ancient, but the way they have stood the test of time makes it see as though they were built but a few decades prior!\n\nUnfortunately, the almanac tends to describe rather bizzare places as possibly containing map pieces, so instead of soaking in the ambiance I head for a gambling den called 'The Lucky Turtle Betting Shop'. It's instructions are more than a bit odd. Apparently, if I show the rather crude drawing of a octopus on page fifty-seven to the betting shop's manager, I may find what I seek. Sceptical as I am, I ask to see the manager, show her the picture, and sure enough she retieves an aged piece of paper and hands it to me..."
 lotr_khy.0303.lyneria.desc: "We make landfall in Lyneria, leading city of the Lynerian League. The Hall of the Hundred Flags dominates the view from the harbour, its opulence the stuff of dreams. Gleaming golden domes, obsidian pillars, and dazzling turquoise mosaics make it a sight to behold, overshadowing all the buildings around it. Not that those buildings aren't impressive in their own right; the abundance of ivory ornamentation on every facet of many of the city's halls makes it a true sight to behold. In comparrison to Emelkyn, my first experience with a city of the League, it is clear why Lyneria has taken for itself the prime spot. The Spire of the Watch is an architectural marvel, but it is just one wonder in a city otherwise much like those of the Utter South. In Lyneria, even the warehouses speak of the city's astounding prosperity.\n\nThe almanac indicates that I ought to find a map fragment in a public bathhouse, of all places! Winding my way through the steep streets, I come to the building, which is unlike any bathhouse I have ever encountered in my life. Entering through grand mahogany doors, I immerse myself in the crystal-clear water to ponder my life choices, a dirty stain spreading out around me. Noticing that one of the lustrous turquoise wall tiles is slightly loose, I carefully remove it to find..."

Carefully, I piece the fragments together to reveal the whole map. The road ahead of me looks to lead further inland than I have ever been in my life, up the Nuar and thence into the highlands in the utmost west of Harshandatt. I should've known that an unlooted tomb of a Nhazadh would be far from the shores, but the prospect of leaving the sea so far behind unnerves me.\n\nI gather my crew on deck and tell them where our course leads.

All together, my men heave at the boulders covering the enterance with sturdy ropes, their technique well-honed from a life at sea.\n\nSlowly but surely, the gateway into the depths of the earth reveals itself. Torches in hand, we enter into the darkness, the stale air and thousands of years of dust almost choking us. As any courageous leader should, I take the lead, uneven floor and pegleg be damned.\n\nBarely a hundred paces is, I trip on a rock and an arrow shoots out of the wall and breezes past my forehead.
