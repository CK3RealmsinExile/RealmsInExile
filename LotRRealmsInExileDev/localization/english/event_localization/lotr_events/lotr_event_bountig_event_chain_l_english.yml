  ### KHAND & OVATHA EVENTS ###
  
  bountig_event_chain.5001.t:0 "Rumours from Mistrand"
  bountig_event_chain.5001.desc:0 "While reviewing various reports from my spies and outriders, I come across a detailed description of recent events at the court of [GetTitleByKey('c_mistrand').GetNameNoTier], far to the north.\n\nThis city, situated on the eastern bay of the [seaofrhun|E] and home to wealthy traders, lies at the heart of the realm of the Easterlings, whose many tribes have been bickering and fighting amongst themselves for so many centuries now that this era has become commonly known as the Time of Blood.\n\nThe report describes a noticeable change in this regard. It speaks of a prominent advisor by the name of [bountigmedlokan.GetName], who travels from court to court, promoting unity among the rivalling tribes and rulers.\n\nI am taken aback by this revelation. Should the Easterlings unite under a single banner, who could stop them from invading Khand, which is currently just as divided as the Rhûnnic lands are?"
  bountig_event_chain.5001.a:0 "Send my best spies to [GetTitleByKey('c_mistrand').GetNameNoTier] to investigate further!"
  bountig_event_chain.5001.a.tt:0 "You will receive another report on [bountigmedlokan.GetFirstName] after some time has passed"
  bountig_event_chain.5001.b:0 "This rhûnnic mongrel is no threat to us."
  bountig_event_chain.5001.b.tt:0 "You choose to ignore the rise of [bountigmedlokan.GetFirstName]"
  
  bountig_event_chain.5002.t:0 "Troubling Reports from the North"
  bountig_event_chain.5002.desc:0 "Many days have passed since I dispatched spies to Rhûn to investigate the rumours surrounding [bountigmedlokan.GetName], the easterling leader intending to mend the rivalries between the bickering rhûnnic tribes between the [seaofrhun|E] and the western plains.\n\nNot all of my men have escaped [GetTitleByKey('c_mistrand').GetNameNoTier] unscathed and some have not returned at all. Those who did all report the same thing: [bountigmedlokan.GetFirstName] enjoys high standing among the Easterling lords, and is actively using his influence to unite the shattered realms of Rhûn into a single kingdom.\n\nI am immediately aware of the danger such a united realm would pose. The men of [khand|E] are just as disunited as the Easterlings are, and their squabbling leaders will present an easy prey for any united realm of Rhûn - a much more tempting target than mighty [gondor|E] far to the west.\n\nWith this dire threat burned into the back of my head, I come to the only logical conclusion: it must be me who unites the Men of Khand so I can prevent an invasion from the savages to our north..."
  bountig_event_chain.5002.a:0 "I won't let the Easterlings enslave us!"
  bountig_event_chain.5002.a.tt:0 "Unlocks a [decision|E] to unite [GetTitleByKey('k_upper_khand').GetNameNoTier] in your name"
  
  bountig_event_chain.5003.t:0 "Upper Khand Proclaimed"
  bountig_event_chain.5003.desc:0 "I have done it.\n\nMuch time and efforts I have invested; sowing fears and paying bribes, fostering common hatred of Rhûn and forging new alliances - but it has all been worth it. Today, a crown shall be placed upon my head!\n\nLet the Lords of [GetTitleByKey('k_upper_khand').GetNameNoTier] bend the knee before their new ruler who unites them and protects them from the barbaric Easterlings to our north!\n\nSend out the fastest riders and bring the news of my ascension to every corner of my new realm, and let all swear their oaths of fealty to me!"
  bountig_event_chain.5003.a:0 "None shall defy my rule."
  bountig_event_chain.5003.a.tt:0 "You will demand fealty from the rulers of [GetTitleByKey('k_upper_khand').GetNameNoTier]"
  
  bountig_event_chain.5004.opening:0 "Noble Lord of [GetTitleByKey('k_upper_khand').GetNameNoTier],"
  bountig_event_chain.5004.desc:0 "It is with a heavy heart that I pen this missive. The threat from the north grows with every passing day, and soon the savage Easterlings will unite and make slaves of our wives and children.\n\nBut together we can avert this terrible fate. Swear your fealty to me and I shall grant you protection and keep your lands and loved ones safe!"
  bountig_event_chain.5004.a:0 "You have my sword, my liege."
  bountig_event_chain.5004.b:0 "I will be fine on my own."
  
  bountig_event_chain.5005.opening:0 "My Valorous Liege,"
  bountig_event_chain.5005.desc:0 "Your claim is just and your goals are noble. May you be our stalwart shield against the savages of the North!"
  bountig_event_chain.5005.a:0 "Excellent."
  
  bountig_event_chain.5006.opening:0 "False Pretender,"
  bountig_event_chain.5006.desc:0 "Your fearmongering and bribery will be your doom. We reject your claim and will remain independent."
  bountig_event_chain.5006.a:0 "If the pen won't convince them, the sword might..."
  bountig_event_chain.5006.b:0 "I have no need of these worthless fools."
