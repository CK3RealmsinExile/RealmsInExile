  ### BOUNTIG EVENTS ###
  bountig_special_raid_for_captives_cb:0 "Raid against Rohan"
  #Bountig accepts the contract in the East
  bountig_event_chain.0003.t:0 "March to War"
  bountig_event_chain.0003.desc:0 "I have heeded the call, and now begin my long trek westward. In my wake, I leave behind my childhood, my love, my innocence, and all that I have ever known. To what do I march? To glory? To death? Or to some other destiny that I do not yet know?"
  bountig_event_chain.0003.a:0 "There is naught but forward."

  #Bountig gets offered land or gold, either ending or boosting his story line
  bountig_event_chain.0005.t:0 "Victory in the Green Plains"
  bountig_event_chain.0005.desc:0 "It was a near thing, but somehow we have prevailed. The horsemen have retreated - though they shall likely return in time. We have established a foothold in this land, and [sponsor] now bequeaths us our rewards. Many of my fellows died in the fray, but that means those of us who survived have an even greater prize. In recognition of my skill and vital role, [attacker.GetName] has offered me my choice of reward. He has offered me many things - gold, a choice position in his court, or even a title and domain of my own, if I wish."
  bountig_event_chain.0005.a:0 "Gold and glory are just currencies in pursuit of a greater goal."
  bountig_event_chain.0005.b:0 "I shall make a new home here."
  bountig_event_chain.0005.b.tt:0 "#N This ends [bountigmedlokan.GetName]'s story line!#! "

  #Eastern Rohan vassals get opportunity to join war
  bountig_event_chain.0010.t:0 "The Eastern Threat Returns"
  bountig_event_chain.0010.desc:0 "For many years now, the lands to our east have been ones of chaos. Since the days when Eorl slew the foul Balchoth Emperor, his former subjects have squabbled like vultures over the corpse of the lands which once formed his realm. It was inevitable that the chaos would spread, and like a blight, it encroaches upon all lands the Easterling touch. Many a raid have the foolish and the hardy aimed against our eastern walls, seeking plunder and land both.\n\nSo it is once again. We have heard messages of an incoming Easterling force - unusually substantial in size and equipment. Thus, we have been summoned to send whatever forces we can spare to ensure that once the foe is defeated, they do not escape into the countryside to pillage while we hunt them down."
  bountig_event_chain.0010.a:0 "I will answer the summons myself!"
  bountig_event_chain.0010.b:0 "[GetTitleByKey('k_rohan').GetHolder.GetNamePossessiveRegnal] normal levies shall suffice"

  #Bountig is forced to travel southwards after losing the war
  bountig_event_chain.0011.t:0 "Defeat in the Green Plains"
  bountig_event_chain.0011.desc:0 "I should have known better. So young, so foolish still! Blinded by gold and glory alike, I could only watch in horror as the horsemen of the green plains scattered my fellows and slaughtered them near to a man. What few survived nigh begged for death. Only by the grace of the Gods did I survive, slipping away in the chaos as the battle turned ill.\n\nShaking as a leaf, I abandon my armor. Frantically, I think back to the meetings before it all went wrong, and those maps - such small scraps of paper, and yet now my only survival! At last calming my breath, I open my eyes once more, and find the sun. The hour is late now, and as such I can tell east from west. Death alone awaits me if I go east, west, or north, for the Horsemen were many, and I know they went those ways. So the south alone remains.\n\nA different terror is upon me now. Legends speak of the south - and of those who live there. Men tall as giants, demons of hate made flesh. Our foes of old, it is said. Builders of monumental houses and fortresses my people cannot dream of. Their gazes pierce the mind and read the hearts of those who come before them. If I dare this road, will they slay me? Will they know me? Yet I have no other choice. This is the only path left to me."
  bountig_event_chain.0011.a:0 "I master my fear, and walk to an unknown Doom."
  bountig_event_chain.0011.a.tt:0 "Travel to [gondor_ruler.GetCapitalLocation.GetCounty.GetTitle.GetNameNoTier]"

  ### KHAND & OVATHA EVENTS ###
  
  bountig_event_chain.5001.t:0 "Rumours from Mistrand"
  bountig_event_chain.5001.desc:0 "Mistrand. Heart of [rhun|E]. Located on the eastern shore of the [seaofrhun|E], its high walls cast long shadows upon the golden plains, and through its gates pass merchants and mercenaries alike. As with any city, intrigue happens in the shadows and in the bustling markets; intrigue which is, on the whole, irrelevant to us. For the Easterlings are disunited, and the bickering of countless warring clans and tribes has rent Rhûn. So it has been for many years, much to our advantage.\n\nYet from the north travelling merchants and traders now bring me more troubling rumours. One [bountigmedlokan.GetFirstName], a former mercenary who has grown in popularity amongst the people and lords of [GetTitleByKey('c_mistrand').GetNameNoTier], has instead preached a message of unity amongst the Easterling lords, encouraging them to instead join forces against foreign enemies and overlords.\n\nUs included. The disunity of the Easterling lands offers plenty of opportunities for pillage and tribute, but if this northern savage succeeds in his quest, then the new Easterling realm might not only strip us of tributaries, but pose an existential threat."
  bountig_event_chain.5001.a:0 "Send my best spies to [GetTitleByKey('c_mistrand').GetNameNoTier] to investigate further!"
  bountig_event_chain.5001.a.tt:0 "You will receive another report on [bountigmedlokan.GetFirstName] after some time has passed"
  bountig_event_chain.5001.b:0 "This rhûnnic mongrel is no threat to us."
  bountig_event_chain.5001.b.tt:0 "You choose to ignore the rise of [bountigmedlokan.GetFirstName]"
  
  bountig_event_chain.5002.t:0 "The Easterling Menace"
  bountig_event_chain.5002.desc:0 "Some days ago I dispatched my riders to [GetTitleByKey('c_mistrand').GetNameNoTier], hoping to gather more information about this [bountigmedlokan.GetFirstName] and his efforts in uniting the disparate Easterling tribes. Not all of them return, and many who do arrive bloodied and beaten. They all confirm what I had already suspected in my heart.\n\nThis Bountig has had great success in his quest, more than many had suspected, and his influence is high amongst the commoners and nobles of [rhun|E] alike. The threat posed by this to our interests and very existence cannot be underestimated.\n\nKhand is also disunited, just as Rhûn is; in this the Variags and Easterlings are one and the same, I fear. If we are to survive the threat of these northern savages, then, Khand must be united. I feel it to be my imperative, for only the strength of all the Variags can hold off the Easterling hordes.\n\n #Italic I#! must make it so."
  bountig_event_chain.5002.a:0 "I won't let the Easterlings enslave us!"
  bountig_event_chain.5002.a.tt:0 "Unlocks a [decision|E] to unite [GetTitleByKey('k_upper_khand').GetNameNoTier] in your name"
  
  bountig_event_chain.5003.t:0 "Upper Khand Proclaimed"
  bountig_event_chain.5003.desc:0 "I have done it.\n\nMuch time and efforts I have invested; sowing fears and paying bribes, fostering common hatred of Rhûn and forging new alliances - but it has all been worth it. Today, a crown shall be placed upon my head!\n\nLet the Lords of [GetTitleByKey('k_upper_khand').GetNameNoTier] bend the knee before their new ruler who unites them and protects them from the barbaric Easterlings to our north!\n\nSend out the fastest riders and bring the news of my ascension to every corner of my new realm, and let all swear their oaths of fealty to me!"
  bountig_event_chain.5003.a:0 "None shall defy my rule."
  bountig_event_chain.5003.a.tt:0 "You will demand fealty from the rulers of [GetTitleByKey('k_upper_khand').GetNameNoTier]"
  
  bountig_event_chain.5004.opening:0 "Noble Lord of [GetTitleByKey('k_upper_khand').GetNameNoTier],"
  bountig_event_chain.5004.desc:0 "It is with a heavy heart that I pen this missive. The threat from the north grows with every passing day, and soon the savage Easterlings will unite and make slaves of our wives and children.\n\nBut together we can avert this terrible fate. Swear your fealty to me and I shall grant you protection and keep your lands and loved ones safe!"
  bountig_event_chain.5004.a:0 "You have my sword, my liege."
  bountig_event_chain.5004.b:0 "I will be fine on my own."
  
  bountig_event_chain.5005.opening:0 "My Valorous Liege,"
  bountig_event_chain.5005.desc:0 "Your claim is just and your goals are noble. May you be our stalwart shield against the savages of the North!"

  bountig_event_chain.5006.opening:0 "False Pretender,"
  bountig_event_chain.5006.desc:0 "Your fearmongering and bribery will be your doom. We reject your claim and will remain independent."
  bountig_event_chain.5006.a:0 "If the pen won't convince them, the sword might..."
  bountig_event_chain.5006.b:0 "I have no need of these worthless fools."
