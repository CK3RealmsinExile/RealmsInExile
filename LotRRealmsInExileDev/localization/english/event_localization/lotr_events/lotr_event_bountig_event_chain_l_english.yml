  ### KHAND & OVATHA EVENTS ###
  
  bountig_event_chain.5001.t:0 "Rumours from Mistrand"
  bountig_event_chain.5001.desc:0 "Mistrand. Heart of [rhun|E]. Located on the eastern shore of the [seaofrhun|E], its high walls cast long shadows upon the golden plains, and through its gates pass merchants and mercenaries alike. As with any city, intrigue happens in the shadows and in the bustling markets; intrigue which is, on the whole, irrelevant to us. For the Easterlings are disunited, and the bickering of countless warring clans and tribes has rent Rhûn. So it has been for many years, much to our advantage.\n\nYet from the north travelling merchants and traders now bring me more troubling rumours. One [bountigmedlokan.GetFirstName], a former mercenary who has grown in popularity amongst the people and lords of [GetTitleByKey('c_mistrand').GetNameNoTier], has instead preached a message of unity amongst the Easterling lords, encouraging them to instead join forces against foreign enemies and overlords.\n\nUs included. The disunity of the Easterling lands offers plenty of opportunities for pillage and tribute, but if this northern savage succeeds in his quest, then the new Easterling realm might not only strip us of tributaries, but pose an existential threat."
  bountig_event_chain.5001.a:0 "Send my best spies to [GetTitleByKey('c_mistrand').GetNameNoTier] to investigate further!"
  bountig_event_chain.5001.a.tt:0 "You will receive another report on [bountigmedlokan.GetFirstName] after some time has passed"
  bountig_event_chain.5001.b:0 "This rhûnnic mongrel is no threat to us."
  bountig_event_chain.5001.b.tt:0 "You choose to ignore the rise of [bountigmedlokan.GetFirstName]"
  
  bountig_event_chain.5002.t:0 "The Easterling Menace"
  bountig_event_chain.5002.desc:0 "Some days ago I dispatched my riders to [GetTitleByKey('c_mistrand').GetNameNoTier], hoping to gather more information about this [bountigmedlokan.GetFirstName] and his efforts in uniting the disparate Easterling tribes. Not all of them return, and many who do arrive bloodied and beaten. They all confirm what I had already suspected in my heart.\n\nThis Bountig has had great success in his quest, more than many had suspected, and his influence is high amongst the commoners and nobles of [rhun|E] alike. The threat posed by this to our interests and very existence cannot be underestimated.\n\nKhand is also disunited, just as Rhûn is; in this the Variags and Easterlings are one and the same, I fear. If we are to survive the threat of these northern savages, then, Khand must be united. I feel it to be my imperative, for only the strength of all the Variags can hold off the Easterling hordes.\n\n #Italic I#! must make it so."
  bountig_event_chain.5002.a:0 "I won't let the Easterlings enslave us!"
  bountig_event_chain.5002.a.tt:0 "Unlocks a [decision|E] to unite [GetTitleByKey('k_upper_khand').GetNameNoTier] in your name"
  
  bountig_event_chain.5003.t:0 "Upper Khand Proclaimed"
  bountig_event_chain.5003.desc:0 "I have done it.\n\nMuch time and efforts I have invested; sowing fears and paying bribes, fostering common hatred of Rhûn and forging new alliances - but it has all been worth it. Today, a crown shall be placed upon my head!\n\nLet the Lords of [GetTitleByKey('k_upper_khand').GetNameNoTier] bend the knee before their new ruler who unites them and protects them from the barbaric Easterlings to our north!\n\nSend out the fastest riders and bring the news of my ascension to every corner of my new realm, and let all swear their oaths of fealty to me!"
  bountig_event_chain.5003.a:0 "None shall defy my rule."
  bountig_event_chain.5003.a.tt:0 "You will demand fealty from the rulers of [GetTitleByKey('k_upper_khand').GetNameNoTier]"
  
  bountig_event_chain.5004.opening:0 "Noble Lord of [GetTitleByKey('k_upper_khand').GetNameNoTier],"
  bountig_event_chain.5004.desc:0 "It is with a heavy heart that I pen this missive. The threat from the north grows with every passing day, and soon the savage Easterlings will unite and make slaves of our wives and children.\n\nBut together we can avert this terrible fate. Swear your fealty to me and I shall grant you protection and keep your lands and loved ones safe!"
  bountig_event_chain.5004.a:0 "You have my sword, my liege."
  bountig_event_chain.5004.b:0 "I will be fine on my own."
  
  bountig_event_chain.5005.opening:0 "My Valorous Liege,"
  bountig_event_chain.5005.desc:0 "Your claim is just and your goals are noble. May you be our stalwart shield against the savages of the North!"
  bountig_event_chain.5005.a:0 "Excellent."
  
  bountig_event_chain.5006.opening:0 "False Pretender,"
  bountig_event_chain.5006.desc:0 "Your fearmongering and bribery will be your doom. We reject your claim and will remain independent."
  bountig_event_chain.5006.a:0 "If the pen won't convince them, the sword might..."
  bountig_event_chain.5006.b:0 "I have no need of these worthless fools."
