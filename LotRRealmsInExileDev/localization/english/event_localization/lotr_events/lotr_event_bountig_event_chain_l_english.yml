  ### KHAND & OVATHA EVENTS ###
  
  bountig_event_chain.5001.t:0 "Rumours from Mistrand"
  bountig_event_chain.5001.desc:0 "While reviewing various reports from my spies and outriders, I come across a detailed description of recent events at the court of [GetTitleByKey('c_mistrand').GetNameNoTier], far to the north.\n\nThis city, situated on the eastern bay of the [seaofrhun|E] and home to wealthy traders, lies at the heart of the realm of the Easterlings, whose many tribes have been bickering and fighting amongst themselves for so many centuries now that this era has become commonly known as the Age of Blood.\n\nThe report describes a noticeable change in this regard. It speaks of a prominent advisor by the name of [bountigmedlokan.GetName], who travels from court to court, promoting unity among the rivalling tribes and rulers.\n\nI am taken aback by this revelation. Should the Easterlings unite under a single banner, who could stop them from invading Khand, which is currently just as divided as the Rhûnnic lands are?"
  bountig_event_chain.5001.a:0 "Send my best spy to [GetTitleByKey('c_mistrand').GetNameNoTier] to investigate further!"
  bountig_event_chain.5001.a.tt:0 "You will receive another report on [bountigmedlokan.GetFirstName] after some time has passed"
  bountig_event_chain.5001.b:0 "This rhûnnic mongrel is no threat to us."
  bountig_event_chain.5001.b.tt:0 "You choose to ignore the rise of [bountigmedlokan.GetFirstName]"
