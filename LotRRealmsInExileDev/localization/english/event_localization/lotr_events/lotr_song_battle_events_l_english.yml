 # Opponent Winning
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.diplomacy.low:0 ""You know," muses my opponent, "I may not be much good at speeches, but I'm alarmingly good at [lanquettalirion|E].""
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.diplomacy.medium:0 ""Ahhhh, if only public speaking was as easy as defeating you in an [lanquettalirion|E]," remarks my opponent."
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.diplomacy.high:0 ""I genuinely don't know which is easier," laments my opponent, "out-singing you or telling the tale of your embarrassing loss.""
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.martial.low:0 ""If war was as easy as [lanquettalirion|E], I'd rule the world by now," laughs my opponent. "But then, that's just me.""
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.martial.medium:0 ""Mmmm, you're not much of a strategist, are you?" chortles my opponent."
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.martial.high:0 ""Be it in physical or magical battle, it's all just a case of that most important thing," warbles my opponent. [sb_opponent.GetSheHe|U] taps [sb_opponent.GetHerHis] forehead with a knuckle for emphasis."
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.stewardship.low:0 ""I wish matters of coin were as easy as [lanquettalirion|E]," remarks my opponent. "I'd be swimming in silver.""
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.stewardship.medium:0 ""Do you think [lanquettalirion|E] is good practice for real administration?" questions my opponent idly. "I've always rather thought so. Not that I'm... implying anything by it.""
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.stewardship.high:0 ""I've always said that an [lanquettalirion|E] can teach a [sb_opponent.GetWomanMan] much about running a realm," pontificates my opponent. "And vice versa, naturally.""
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.intrigue.low:0 ""See, this is why I like [lanquettalirion|E]," opines my opponent. "No skulking around, no lying, just a fair contest. One where, well...""
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.intrigue.medium:0 ""Did you know you can learn #EMP exactly#! how someone lies by watching their [sb_myself.Custom('MaskFace')] while they sing?" queries my opponent. "Oh, I didn't mean... just a note...""
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.intrigue.high:0 ""Careful," smirks my opponent, "one more verse like that and I'll pierce right through your defences.""
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.learning.low:0 ""You know, they tell me I need #EMP books#! to prove my smartness," pontificates my opponent, "but I think it's pretty clear right now that I'm not such a lout.""
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.learning.medium:0 ""Honestly," waxes my opponent, "I'm impressed you're doing as well as you are, considering who you're up against.""
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.learning.high:0 ""I've studied ancient lore extensively," explains my opponent, "and I'm sorry to say that by this point I simply don't think there's any way for you to win.""
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.lustful:0 ""As both the world's greatest lover #EMP and#! singer, I don't blame you for losing to me," chortles my opponent."
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.chaste:0 ""Discipline in the home begets discipline in magic, you know," pontificates my opponent. "A little restraint goes a long way.""
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.gluttonous:0 ""I think I might celebrate my win with a feast," muses my opponent. "I feel like something sweet, to go with the victory.""
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.temperate:0 ""I may even allow myself a cup of rose-scented water after this contest," muses my opponent. "I don't treat myself often, but I think I've earned it.""
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.greedy:0 ""The only thing sweeter than clinking gold is the soft pitter-patter of a [sb_myself.GetWomanMan]'s tears along [sb_myself.GetHerHis] cheeks," smiles my opponent. "Don't you agree?""
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.generous:0 ""Look, I may be winning, but if you ask nicely, I'm willing to just... let you have this," explains my opponent, voice dripping with kindness and pity. "There's more to life than winning an [lanquettalirion|E].""
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.lazy:0 "My opponent yawns loudly. "I was honestly expecting a bit more of a challenge, [sb_myself.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]. I'm barely even awake.""
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.diligent:0 ""This is why you need to put the work in," consoles my opponent, tone #EMP utterly#! insufferable. "There's no substitute for hard-work, in life or in lore.""
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.wrathful:0 "My opponent is oddly, uncharacteristically calm. "Oh, not much to be mad about," [sb_opponent.GetSheHe] says, catching my gaze, "when things are going so #EMP well#!.""
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.calm:0 ""I have always found that the key to [lanquettalirion|E] is a clear mind and a cool head," muses my opponent."You'll get that some day.""
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.patient:0 ""Most people," lectures my opponent, "don't fully appreciate quite how tricky it is to pull off [sb_opponent.Custom('sb_RandomPoetPossessive')] [sb_opponent.Custom('sb_RandomVerseType')]. Let alone defend against it.""
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.impatient:0 ""You're really rather slow when you sing, [sb_myself.Custom2('GetYoungMiddleAgedOld',sb_opponent)] [sb_myself.GetWomanMan]", mutters my opponent, drumming [sb_opponent.GetHerHis] fingers together."
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.arrogant:0 ""Don't feel bad [sb_myself.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]," smarms my opponent, reclining where [sb_opponent.GetSheHe] sits leisurely. "We can't all be this naturally #EMP talented#!""
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.humble:0 ""Honestly, you're doing great," chirps my opponent. "I don't usually do this well, so I think you're just having bad luck.""
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.deceitful:1 ""Don't feel too bad," soothes my opponent, voice honey-sweet and caustic as sin." Even [sb_opponent.GetFaith.TricksterGodName] couldn't follow my verses.""
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.honest:0 ""My, this is all going #EMP much#! better than I expected!" exclaims my opponent. "You're not a difficult foe at all... oh, sorry, didn't mean to be rude. Just being honest.""
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.craven:0 ""I... I'm winning? I'm winning!" cries my opponent. [sb_opponent.GetSheHe|U] seems genuinely surprised, but then, [sb_opponent.GetSheHe] #EMP has#! spent half the contest watching through [sb_opponent.GetHerHis] fingers."
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.brave:0 ""You'll permit me a little chuckle," remarks my opponent. "but you're going to have to sing bolder than #EMP that#! to defeat #EMP me#!""
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.shy:0 ""All that practice is paying off!" squeaks my opponent, beaming in timid pride at how well the contest is looking for [sb_opponent.GetHerHim]."
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.gregarious:0 ""Don't feel too bad," drawls my opponent, cracking [sb_opponent.GetHerHis] knuckles. "I speak words of power like I make friends. Alarmingly easily.""
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.ambitious:0 ""Do you think they appoint some kind of... #EMP Master#! of Lore?" queries my opponent, scratching [sb_opponent.GetHerHis] chin. "I feel like I'm working towards that title already, you see.""
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.content:0 ""What a lovely [lanquettalirion|E]," chortles my opponent. "We couldn't ask for anything better, could we? Besides your luck, I mean.""
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.arbitrary:0 ""I'm not generally much of a one for rules," opines my opponent, "but [lanquettalirion|E] makes me see the appeal, just a little. They let you #EMP force#! other people to admit you're better than them sometimes.""
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.just:0 ""Look," explains my opponent, waving a parchment at me. "I'm sorry you keep trying to use forbidden magic, but if you'd #EMP stick to the rules#!, you'd be doing better.""
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.cynical:0 ""Naturally, I'm not taking it easy on you," leers my opponent. "You #EMP definitely#! wouldn't on me, so why bother?""
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.zealous:0 ""I wish I could take credit for this sure-victory," lazes my opponent, "but it's all the work of [sb_opponent.GetFaith.KnowledgeGodName] #EMP through#! me.""
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.paranoid:0 ""I know you've still got some trick up your sleeve," scowls my opponent. "No one can possibly be #EMP this#! easy to defeat.""
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.trusting:0 ""I might just just tell you what kind of spell I favour. Don't go spreading the news everywhere!""
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.compassionate:0 ""I'm sorry if I'm putting you in a bad position, [sb_myself.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]," says my opponent, [sb_opponent.GetHerHis] voice genuinely remorseful. "I practise [lanquettalirion|E] for fun, but I think it's fun when we're #EMP both#! enjoying it.""
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.callous:0 ""By [sb_opponent.GetFaith.HouseholdGodName], you don't put up much of a fight, do you?" exclaims my opponent bluntly."
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.sadistic:0 ""It's #EMP so#! much more fun to toy with a wounded foe," drawls my opponent with no small amount of delighted venom, "don't you agree, [sb_myself.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]?""
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.stubborn:0 ""Quite nice to have such an easy win for a change," scoffs my opponent. "Usually I have to argue for a few hours before my adversary admits I should have won.""
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.fickle:0 ""I really love that, no matter what strategy I settle on, you always lose just as hard," quips my opponent."
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.vengeful:0 ""Of course, this is all just payback," hisses my opponent. "And you know #EMP damned#! well what for.""
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.trait.forgiving:0 ""To be frank, I was expecting a bit more of a challenge," whines my opponent. "It's alright, though. At least you're good practice.""
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.relation.friend:0 ""Cheer up, sour-[sb_myself.Custom('MaskFace')]," laughs my opponent. "It's just a little contest between friends, right?""
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.relation.best_friend:0 ""For what it's worth, win or lose," says my best friend, "there's no one in the world I'd rather exchange magic spells with.""
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.relation.rival:0 ""By [sb_opponent.GetFaith.FateGodName], you're as bad at [lanquettalirion|E] as you are at ruling!" cackles my rival."
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.relation.nemesis:0 "My nemesis says nothing. [sb_opponent.GetSheHe|U] simply stares at me, [sb_opponent.Custom('EyeEyes')] burning with pure, unrefined #EMP hate#!."
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.relation.lover:0 "Without breaking eye contact with me, my lover begins to gently invoke the wild animals in the heat of the deep woods, the pleasures of the body and mind and... Oh. #EMP Oh my#!"
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.relation.soulmate:0 "My soulmate is only half paying attention to our [lanquettalirion|E]. Mostly, [sb_opponent.GetSheHe] seems focused on staring deep into my [sb_myself.Custom('EyeEyes')]."
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.hook_on.weak:0 ""$song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.hook_on.strong$""
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.hook_on.strong:0 "It feels good to turn the tables on you, you know," says my opponent. "Always seems like you've got me under your thumb. Unless we're engaged in [lanquettalirion|E], of course."
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.hooked_by.weak:0 ""$song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.hooked_by.strong$""
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.hooked_by.strong:0 "You're not throwing this deliberately because of our #EMP agreement#! are you?" queries my opponent, scratching [sb_opponent.GetHerHis] chin thoughtfully. "Because you play like you're trying to lose."
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.match_history.recently_won_against.default:0 ""Ahhh, how many times have I defeated you, now?" chuckles my opponent. "I #EMP honestly#! lose count.""
 #song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.match_history.recently_won_against.county:0 ""[sb_myself.MakeScope.Var('sb_recent_land_loss_stake').Title.GetNameNoTier] is doing well you know," drawls my opponent, "#EMP much#! better since I took over the place.""
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.match_history.recently_won_against.gamble:0 ""Another [lanquettalirion|E]," notes my opponent, "another win for my tally. You're going to bankrupt yourself, you know.""
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.match_history.recently_lost_against.default:0 ""Now this," titters my opponent, "is #EMP much#! better than that #EMP other#! [lanquettalirion|E] we played.""
 #song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.match_history.recently_lost_against.county:0 ""After [sb_opponent.MakeScope.Var('sb_recent_land_loss_stake').Title.GetNameNoTier], I can't defeat you enough," grumbles my opponent, still sore after our old bet."
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.match_history.recently_lost_against.gamble:0 ""Looks like the bet's going my way this time, doesn't it?" chortles my opponent."
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.other.pro_gamer:0 ""You should really pay close attention to my verses," smarms my opponent. "I'm about to do what's called a pro-singer verse.""
 song_battle.0001.desc.opponent_winning.other.avlf:0 ""#EMP You're#! a lore master? Don't flatter yourself, [sb_myself.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]. You're not even an acolyte.""

 # Player Winning
 song_battle.0001.desc.i_am_winning.diplomacy.low:0 ""I don't... I can't... Just ease up on me!" all-but-screams my opponent, clearly frustrated and unable to find the right words."
 song_battle.0001.desc.i_am_winning.diplomacy.medium:0 "My opponent says nothing, simply drumming [sb_opponent.GetHerHis] massaging [sb_opponent.GetHerHis] temples in a fit of pique."
 song_battle.0001.desc.i_am_winning.diplomacy.high:0 ""It would seem," snarks my opponent, "that you have me at a slight disadvantage. For now.""
 song_battle.0001.desc.i_am_winning.martial.low:0 ""Can't lead soldiers," moans my opponent, "can't sing. What good am I?""
 song_battle.0001.desc.i_am_winning.martial.medium:0 "My opponent strokes [sb_opponent.GetHerHis] chin thoughtfully. "I was #EMP positive#! that that stratagem would've worked...""
 song_battle.0001.desc.i_am_winning.martial.high:0 ""If this were a #EMP real#! battle," declares my opponent, "things would be going differently!""
 song_battle.0001.desc.i_am_winning.stewardship.low:0 ""Why is planning #EMP always#! this hard?" pouts my opponent. "The [lanquettalirion|E] needs you to think so far ahead and I just #EMP can't#!""
 song_battle.0001.desc.i_am_winning.stewardship.medium:0 "My opponent stares intently at me. "I must... I must have miscalculated somewhere...""
 song_battle.0001.desc.i_am_winning.stewardship.high:0 ""It pains me to say it," grumbles my opponent, "but the odds just aren't looking good for me.""
 song_battle.0001.desc.i_am_winning.intrigue.low:0 ""Could you ease up on the #EMP blatant#! cheating for a moment?" snarls my opponent."
 song_battle.0001.desc.i_am_winning.intrigue.medium:0 ""I suspect my strategy my need more... cunning..." murmurs my opponent, eyeing me frustratedly."
 song_battle.0001.desc.i_am_winning.intrigue.high:0 ""You may think you're winning," chortles my opponent, "but you only think that because I want you to think that. And I know that you know that I know you know that.""
 song_battle.0001.desc.i_am_winning.learning.low:0 ""This is completely unfair, I don't even #EMP understand#! half these words," snorts my opponent. "You're clearly making them up as we sing.""
 song_battle.0001.desc.i_am_winning.learning.medium:0 ""Are you using [sb_myself.Custom('sb_RandomPoetPossessive')] [sb_myself.Custom('sb_RandomVerseType')] #EMP again#!?" moans my opponent. "You are #EMP so#! cheap.""
 song_battle.0001.desc.i_am_winning.learning.high:0 ""I knew I shouldn't have opened with [sb_opponent.Custom('sb_RandomPoetPossessive')] [sb_opponent.Custom('sb_RandomVerseType')]," whines my opponent. "I've essentially lost already.""
 song_battle.0001.desc.i_am_winning.trait.lustful:0 "My opponent doesn't seem to be paying attention to the contest at all, instead invoking lascivious rhymes under [sb_opponent.GetHerHis] breath."
 song_battle.0001.desc.i_am_winning.trait.chaste:0 ""This is the issue with [lanquettalirion|E]," cries my opponent, gesticulating wildly. "It inflames the passions! Arouses the senses! It's raw, carnal excess in its basest form.""
 song_battle.0001.desc.i_am_winning.trait.gluttonous:0 "My opponent chews idly on a small bread roll, lost in a haze of crumbs and concentration."
 song_battle.0001.desc.i_am_winning.trait.temperate:0 ""Hrmph," grumbles my opponent. "Taking risks like this is going to do you a mischief some day.""
 song_battle.0001.desc.i_am_winning.trait.greedy:0 "My opponent idly flips a coin between [sb_opponent.GetHerHis] fingers, the cool metal presumably comforting [sb_opponent.GetHerHim] as [sb_opponent.GetSheHe] eyes [sb_opponent.GetHerHis] impending loss."
 song_battle.0001.desc.i_am_winning.trait.generous:0 "My opponent gives me a kindly smile. "You're doing #EMP so#! well, keep it up!""

 song_battle.0001.desc.i_am_winning.trait.calm:0 "My opponent's usually-serene bearing is... distorted. The slight twist of a frown clouds [sb_opponent.Custom('MaskFace_BehindAcross')] [sb_opponent.GetHerHis] [sb_opponent.Custom('MaskFace')]."
 song_battle.0001.desc.i_am_winning.trait.patient:0 ""You may have the upper hand for now," observes my opponent, "but you'll slip up eventually. They always do.""
