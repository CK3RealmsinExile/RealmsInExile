 nazgul.0001.desc:0 "My councilor [messenger.GetTitledFirstName] approaches me, a worried frown on [messenger.GetHerHis] face.\n\n"My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], I come bearing troubling news. Your peasants speak of a dark shadow, a rider dressed in black, asking for you by name. I would think nothing of it but for how terrified all witnesses were."\n\nThis sounds ominous but there isn't much I can do at the moment."
 nazgul.0001.a:0 "Disturbing news indeed"

 nazgul.0002.t:0 "A Murder at Court"
 nazgul.0002.desc:0 "[messenger.GetTitledFirstName|U] comes into my throne room at a run, visibly shaken.\n\n"My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], a murder! There has been a murder inside the castle! Your [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMeShort', SCOPE.sC('victim'))] [victim.GetTitledFirstName] has been found dead in a pool of blood, a strange knife planted in [victim.GetHerHis] chest. An ominous note was found on [victim.GetHerHim]."\n\nThe note reads: "#italic You have taken something which is precious to me. Return it or suffer the consequences #!"\n\nShould I return this Ring to its previous owner? I must confess it has grown precious to me as well..." 
 nazgul.0002.a:0 "Double the guard! Let no stranger in without my word!"
 nazgul.0002.b:0 "The Ring is mine! Let the heralds issue a challenge to this Black Rider"
 nazgul.002.b.tt:0 "You will challenge the Nazgûl for ownership of the Ring"

 nazgul.0003.desc.black_breath:0 "has been found wounded in [victim.GetHerHis] own room, [victim.GetSheHe] says a tall stranger in black attacked [victim.GetHerHim], but the assailant was scared off by a guard.

 nazgul.0050.t:0 "The Lieutenant of Dol Guldur"
 nazgul.0050.desc:0 "Once heir to a great empire of the farthest east, [khamulshort|E] now stands as the second greatest of [sauroncharacter|E]'s nine fingers, the [nazgulcharacter|E].\n\nKhamûl has been given the mastery of Dol Guldur for two purposes; first, to wage war upon the Elven-realms of Lasgalen and Lothlorien, and secondly, and perhaps more importantly, to keep an eye on the [anduin|E] river, where [isildur|E] is rumored to have perished and lost the [onering|E]. Many of the surrounding Woodsmen already dread and fear Dol Guldur, and Khamûl shall leverage this into servitude - yet others remain proud and defiant in independence.\n\nThe Elves of the region are shadows of their former greatness, but even now possess formidable strength. But should their fall come, then the last holdout in the region shall be Dale and Erebor. United with the great host arising in Rhûn, the hammer and anvil will smash the last descendants of the Kingdom of Rhovanion and the seat of the line of Durin."
 nazgul.0050.a:0 "All of Wilderland shall bow to Sauron."
 
 nazgul.0051.t:0 "The Marshalling of Mordor"
 nazgul.0051.desc:0 "As the years pass, the wheels of Sauron's great designs move, and the time grows nigh for the great westward campaign. As a result, Sauron can no longer dedicate forces to the protection of Dol Guldur, and Khamûl shall have to stand on his own - at least for now."
 nazgul.0051.a:0 "I am honored by your trust, master."
 nazgul.0051.a.tt:0 "You will no longer be a [tributary|e] of Mordor"

 nazgul.0060.t:0 "First of the Nine"
 nazgul.0060.desc:0 "Little is known of the Lord of the [nazgulcharacter|E]. Once he was [ermurazor|E], second son of the King of [numenor|E]. Though rich and powerful in his own right, he was discontent as the simple second son, for he was not destined for much greatness. \n\nHe desired more, yet his many attempts and ambitions for his own kingdom in [middleearth|E] all failed, and he grew further frustrated and angry. It was thus that he was taken under the wing of one [annatarcharacter|E], who was none else but [sauroncharacter|E]. Under his tutelage he grew more powerful, growing to a great and skilled sorcerer. It was then that he was offered a Ring , and a chance of true power. \n\nSo he submitted to Sauron, and forevermore he was bound to his master. Yet it was only later, after the [warlastalliance] and the resurgence of Sauron in the [thirdage|E] that he would rise again. In the North he would form a new kingdom, and it was there he would recieve the name that he would forevermore be known as: The Witch-King of [angmar|E]. \n\nBy his hand [arnor|E] was destroyed, reduced to petty clans of [dunedain|E] in the wilderness. Though his kingdom fell, he would join the Dark Tower when it rose again. [minasithil|E], the Tower of the Moon, fell to him; and it would be known as [minasmorgul|E] -- The Tower of Sorcery -- and it would be the personal domain of the Witch-King. \n\nFor a thousand years he has ruled from there, greatest of the servants of [sauronthedarklordcharacter|E]. His presence strikes fear into the hearts of men, and they cower and flee before the Lord of the [nazgulcharacter|E]. By his challenge did Eärnur, last King of Gondor, disappear, and under his leadership [osgiliath|E] was devastated and Ithilien terrorized. \n\nThe hour grows late. Gondor is weak. Ithilien is barren. Osgiliath is in ruins. The Lord of Minas-Morgul readies his armies; waiting patiently for when the armies of Darkness shall march against Middle-Earth."
 nazgul.0060.a:0 "This is my hour!"
