 long_winter.0002.desc:0 "Word reaches me of an unrelenting and bitter cold sweeping across the northern lands of Middle-earth. Snow falls thick and heavy, covering the plains and mountains in an icy shroud long before the usual time. The people of these lands are said to be suffering terribly, with many freezing to death in the biting winds.\n\nThe early frost has ruined harvests and left food supplies perilously low. Families huddle together in whatever warmth they can find, but starvation looms large, and fear grows that this winter may bring suffering unlike any in living memory. Traders and travellers speak of empty roads and villages silenced by the cold, the once-bustling north reduced to grim endurance.\n\nAs the snows deepen and the cold spreads, the fate of those caught in its grip grows ever more uncertain."
