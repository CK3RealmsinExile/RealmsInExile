 ### FACTION ALIGNMENT DECISIONS ###
 dorwinion.0001.t:0 "Picking Sides"
 dorwinion.0001.desc:0 "For years, two opposing political factions have dominated the political landscape of Dorwinion: the Winelords and the Master Merchants.\n\nThe Great Merchants were the first great lords of the realm, accumulating vast wealth through great trade routes sent East and West. These commercial giants now stand as the mercantile elites in Dorwinion's major cities, with strong connections abroad.\n\nThe Winelords, in contrast made their wealth through ownership of large tracts of fertile lands, reaping the blessings of Yavanna and producing the majority of Dorwinion's profitable exports."
 dorwinion.0001.a:0 "We shall align ourselves with the Winelords"
 dorwinion.0001.b:0 "We shall align ourselves with the Master Merchants"
 dorwinion.0001.c:0 "Neither suit our purposes, we remain neutral"

 dorwinion.0004.t:0 "Reign of the Vine"
 dorwinion.0004.desc:0 "The quality of the grapes determines the quality of the wine more than any other factor. The same stands true about leadership, and [dorwinion|E] has seen its fair share of ill rulers who got themselves elected by lying and pledging promises they would forget as soon as the election was over.\n\nSuch lies and petty squabbles will trouble the realm no more! Alongside ridding ourselves of the inherently corrupt system, we have done away with the factionalism that threatened to disrupt all of our politics!\n\nFrom now on, our rulers will embody the true essence of governance—a vintage blend of tradition, nobility, and the boundless potential of Dorwinion united under the auspices of a single dynasty."
 dorwinion.0004.a:0 "Gone are the ballots, replaced by the regal elegance of hereditary rule!"
