 ### Abandon Darkness Events ###
 #Khäz-gramaze
 abdark.0001.t:0 "The Crumbling Serpent-Cult"
 abdark.0001.desc:0 "The Cult of Khäz-gramaze has been in a troubled state as of late. Since the fall of Barad-dûr, the Cult's popularity has been steadily declining and many of my people have started to return to the old ways of worship.\n\nVoices have been growing louder in my court, voices claiming that this is a good development and that we should cast down our remaining shrines to the Serpent-King and promote the worship of Nâdi-manyê.\n\nI cannot pretend that I have not had doubts myself as of late. No matter my decision, I should take a clear stance regarding our peoples' path."
 abdark.0001.a:0 "We have served Khäz-gramaze for long enough."
 abdark.0001.at:0 "You place an idol of Nâdi-manyê on your personal altar."
 abdark.0001.b:0 "Nonsense, we cannot abandon the Long Vengeance!"
 abdark.0001.bt:0 "You demand all your courtiers stay strong in their devotion to Khäz-gramaze."
 abdark.0001.btt:0 "Some of your realm counties may convert anyways."
 
 # Kerkassk
 abdark.0002.t:0 "The Absent Plain-God"
 abdark.0002.desc:0 "Ever since the Dark Lord was brought low by the West, Kerkasskism has been struggling. Our ceremonies do not attract nearly as many followers as they once had and the hatred that fuelled us for so long seems to be fading. In private, many of my people have started to build shrines to the Old Pantheon of our forefathers. Many of my riders speak ill of the Plain-God, Kerkassk, who seemingly abandoned us when we needed him most and give their prayers to the Old Gods of Darkness and Light - Kôr-Sharhaigûn and Hûr-Iriga.\n\nThis morning, I saddled my horse and went out for a long ride across the plains of Rhûn to think. I cannot deny that even my faith in Kerkassk is not as strong as it once was - But should I truly cast aside his worship once and for all?"
 abdark.0002.a:0 "Light and Darkness, two sides of the same coin."
 abdark.0002.at:0 "You return from your ride, go to your personal shrine and sacrifice a hare to the old pantheon for all to see."
 abdark.0002.b:0 "The West will burn for their crimes! I will never betray my god!"
 abdark.0002.bt:0 "You announce to your riders that the faithless will be brought to justice."
 abdark.0002.btt:0 "Some of your realm counties may convert anyways."
