 anarike.0050.t: "A Question of Leadership"
 anarike.0050.desc: "I have secured my influence in all four lynerian city states, and convinced their proud leaders to band together, finally reforming the famed Lynerian League of all. But with that success comes a burden: It falls to me to select one among them to become the leader of this restored nation.\n\n If this decision were left to the Lynerians themselves, they would fall back into their petty squabbles within days, if not hours. By favoring one of them, I can ensure that Lyneria is granted stability, and security. And we shall forge our new alliance for the well-being and profit of all of Anarikê and Lyneria!"

Together, we are strong enough to oppose the dominion of [GetTitleByKey('e_khy').GetNameNoTier] and to gain control over all shipping lanes leading into and out of the Ormal Bay.\n\nWealth and prosperity await us!
