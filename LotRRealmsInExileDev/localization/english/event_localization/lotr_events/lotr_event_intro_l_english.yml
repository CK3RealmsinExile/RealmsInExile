 # Introduction to Galadriel
 lotr_intro_events.0001.t:0 "The Lady of Lórien"
 lotr_intro_events.0001.desc:0 "Once, [galadriel.GetFirstName] left the [blessedrealm|E], proud and desiring of a realm of her own. The daughter of Finarfin, son of Finwë, she is said to be among the greatest of the [noldorelves|E], perhaps being second only to [feanor|E] himself. \n\nWhen offered pardon at the end of the [firstage|E], she refused, declaring she had done nothing requiring pardon. She has dwelled in many lands in pursuit of her dream of lordship, and at last, she now has it. In [lothlorien|E], Galadriel has wrought a realm which is her own, fair and beautiful in equal measure, strong and safe.\n\nBut there is a world beyond Lothlorien, and Galadriel knows this well. Long has she battled [sauroncharacter|E] in her mind, and her aid given where it might aid those beyond her borders. Now, with the end of the age drawing near, wise Galadriel sees only two endings for her realm, and herself. Either the bitter victory, or the long defeat at last. Time shall tell."
 lotr_intro_events.0001.a:0 "The Shadow stirs in Dol Guldur. We must act, lest it consumes us."
 lotr_intro_events.0001.att:0 "Once, the realm of [lorien|E] extended to the eves of Fangorn and the Limlight. [men|E] now dwell in the fields of Celebrant, imperiled by the Shadow. Perhaps the time has come to take them under the protection of the [galadhrimelves|E] and reassert the ancient boundaries of Lórien.\n\n#P You send an envoy to the [leofringculture.GetNamePlural] of [GetTitleByKey('d_parth_celebrant').GetNameNoTier], a superstitious but honorable folk, and offer them protection as your vassals.#!"
 lotr_intro_events.0001.b:0 "We must see to our own realm."
 lotr_intro_events.0001.btt:0 "#N You chose to leave the [men|E] outside your realm to their fate to focus on preparing for the great clash with [dolguldur|E].#!"
 
 # Introduction to Thranduil
 lotr_intro_events.0002.t:0 "The Elvenking"
 lotr_intro_events.0002.desc:0 "Born in fallen [GetTitleByKey('k_doriath').GetNameNoTier] in [beleriand|E] of old, [thranduil.GetFirstName] is an [elf|E] whose moods change as the seasons. He can be jovial and kind one moment, and appear stubborn and withdrawn the next. It is a temperament that suits his realm's position. Yet none can doubt the skill or the hard-won wisdom of [thranduil.GetNickname|V]. \n\nRising to the throne after the loss of his father Oropher in the [lastallianceshort|E], the Woodland Realm has withdrawn into a stable but secluded position in the northeast of the [greenwoodshort|E]. Here Thranduil built Aradhrynd, the Halls of the Elvenking, made in the memory of Menegroth of old. But Thranduil did not have the riches of Thingol, nor the aid of the [dwarves|E] in its delving, and so it is smaller - a settlement or stronghold, not a city. Even so, those who visit his subterranean halls speak of finely carved stone wrought in the shape of trees, with great well-lit caverns, shafts bringing air and light.\n\nThranduil is a solitary lord - he concerns himself rarely with the affairs of those outside of his realm, foreboding the evil that dwells beyond it. His borders are harassed by [orcs|E], spiders, and even fallen [conceptracemen|E], defiling the ancient forest which once his people alone had ruled. The vigilance of Thranduil and his people is the shield which protects them. But Thranduil has long known that a day will come when the Shadow will fall once more upon all the forest, and when that day comes, he shall fight."
 lotr_intro_events.0002.a:0 "The fortunes of the world will rise and fall, but here in this kingdom, we will endure."
 
 # Introduction to Elrond
 lotr_intro_events.0003.t:0 "The Lord of Imladris"
 lotr_intro_events.0003.desc:0 "Master [elrondshort|E]. A simple title for an Elda of such high lineage. Born as one of the twin children of Ëarendil and Elwing, Elrond had in him united the royal lines of the [sindarelves|E] and the [noldorelves|E] and the chiefs of [conceptracemen|E]. But for himself he took but the title of 'Master', a loyal councilor and regent to his kin Gil-galad, though King or High-king alike were his to claim.\n\nIn the dwindling days of the [thirdage|E], Elrond has taken over leadership of the Noldor still remaining in [middleearth|E], guiding them from the hidden vale of [imladris|E]. In it he has made a refuge of learning and healing, a homely house where lore and knowledge of yore have been preserved.\n\nYet Elrond knows that the peace of Imladris is an island in a sea of chaos, and for him, all endings of the Third Age are now wrought with peril. If the darkness should finally be ended and all the sorrows of the [elves|E] avenged, then Imladris shall fade, and he depart into the west. If the Darkness should triumph, Imladris may stand alone as a beacon of light ere all others fail.\n\nFor now, he will do what he has always done - give what aid and advice he might, and if neccessary, fight..."
 lotr_intro_events.0003.a:0 "A power slumbers here that may yet endure where all others fail."
 
 # Introduction to Cirdan
 lotr_intro_events.0004.t:0 "The Master of the Havens"
 lotr_intro_events.0004.desc:0 "Long has Cirdan waited, and longer yet will he wait. The Lord of the [greyhavens|E] is one of the oldest [elves|E] remaining in [middleearth|E], for long ago he was charged by [ulmocharacter|E] to build ships to ferry Elves to [valinor|E]. Thus he has done, faithfully fulfilling his duty, serving as tutor and councilor to many who have passed through his havens.\n\nThough [lindon|E] is no longer what it once was, Cirdan rules one of the largest and strongest of the Elven realms left in Middle-earth, even in these waning days. Though he is far-off and removed from the threat to the East, Cirdan will ever do his duty, to the [valargods|E] and to the Free People."
 lotr_intro_events.0004.a:0 "My heart is with the Sea, and I will dwell by the grey shores until the last ship sails."

 # Introduction to Bornmir
 lotr_intro_events.0005.t:0 "The Fate of Sîrgala"
 lotr_intro_events.0005.desc:0 "Once, the kingship of Sîrgala stretched far, to Baranduin in the west and as far north as Lake Nenuial. Though not well-peopled, the semi-migratory [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetName] knew peace and propserity, particularly after King Bornmîr swore fealty to High-king Gil-galad. But the [waroftheelvesandsauron|E] brought great devastation to the lands of the Sîrrandrai, for they were a people who knew little of war. In its wake, many of the survivors fled into Lindon or indeed oversea to [valinor|E], with only a hardy few returning to their ancient lands. Thereafter, much of the lands of the Sîrrandrai were settled by [faithfulshort|El] [dunedain|E] settlers, who acknowledged the authority of the Lord of the Sîrrandrai, but now, the world is changing.\n\nWith the [downfallofnumenor|E] and the establishment of Elendil's kingdom of [arnor|E], many now say the time has come for the Sîrrandrai to place the future of their lands in the hands of their mannish vassals and friends. The [dunedain|E] who owe theoretical fealty to Sîrgala yearn to join him, and Elendil is a honorable soul. Now, Merethorn and Eliniel take counsel to decide the fate of their realm..."
 lotr_intro_events.0005.a:0 "We shall place our trust in Elendil."
 lotr_intro_events.0005.a.tt:0 "You will relinquish the lands of [GetTitleByKey('k_sirgala').GetNameNoTier], integrating it into [GetTitleByKey('k_arthedain').GetNameNoTier]. In exchange, you will become the Warden of [GetTitleByKey('d_emyn_beraid').GetNameNoTier]."
 lotr_intro_events.0005.b:0 "Sîrgala wanes, but is not yet gone!"
 lotr_intro_events.0005.b.tt:0 "We shall not cede our claim to Elendil and the Dunedain. This may have consequences, as the Dunedain settlers in our land desire to join with the High-king..."
 
 # Introduction to Lanthir
 lotr_intro_events.0006.t:0 "The Prince of the Penni"
 lotr_intro_events.0006.desc:0 "Long has Aran Lanthir ruled from his secluded court. Three Ages ago he was a lieutenant of the war leader [tareg|E], and by his side he fought the forces of Darkness in the [battleofpalisor|E]. He joined his captain as he marched West, in the footsteps of his fellow [elves|E] who had departed from [cuivienen|E] many years before. \n\nYet he arrived at the shores of the great inland [seaofrhun|E], and he wished to go no further. For here he discovered a great forest unmarred by evil, and in its depths the Elves discovered shimmering pools graced by the [fay|E]: the least of the [ainurgods|E]. After much debate he and a great many others stayed, and henceforth he was known as the Lord of the [penni|E]; as they would come to be known.\n\nFor the Ages thus they secluded themselves, interacting little with the outside world; and they remembered well the betrayal of those [conceptracemen|E] who fell under the sway of [melkorcharacter|E].\n\nYet Lanthir is not a harsh nor stubborn soul, for he regales in poetry and song, and his court is known as a place of wondrous - if strange - music. In times past he wandered in [greenwoodshort|E] and [lorien|E], and he feasted with Oropher and the Lady of the Golden Wood.\n\nBut now again he secludes himself from the outside world, and as the Darkness surrounds his kingdom, he must make a choice: reach out the wider world, or remain in safe seclusion in his forest kingdom."
 lotr_intro_events.0006.a:0 "Soon we must act, lest the Darkness consume us."

 # Introduction to Terilaen
 lotr_intro_events.0007.t:0 "The Cuind King"
 lotr_intro_events.0007.desc:0 "Terilaen, Prince of the [cuind|E] [elves|E] of [thanihazad|E], has more to him than meets the eye. He presents himself as reclusive, never leaving the borders of the kingdom over which he has reigned for years uncounted. Yet that is not the whole truth.\n\nIn secret he has journeyed often into the [mannish|E] realms, disguising himself in countless ways: as a minstrel, blacksmith, pilgrim, fisherman, and a carpenter, among others. In recent years the King has ventured out no more, however.\n\nInstead he has had his hands full as guardian of the young Derei, Prince of the neighboring realm of Gimilêth, in order to prevent any issues with succession. With the recent coming-of-age of the young prince, Terilaen is now free once more.\n\nHe may once more venture out on his adventures, as he once did; yet the [balan_lai|E] are in upheaval, and the Shadow rises once more, and there is much uncertainty in the future."
 lotr_intro_events.0007.a:0 "Perhaps now we must prepare for war."
 
 # Introduction to Maglor
 lotr_intro_events.0008.t:0 "The Last Son of Fëanor" # Title for Maglor intro
 lotr_intro_events.0008.desc:0 "Once, there were seven. Now, I am the last. In folly of youth, despair, love, and rage was an [Concept('oathoffeanor','oath')|E] sworn which drove us to our ruin. To ill end indeed did come all we began well. I will not say no good was done, for good was done. Yet good does not erase evil, even if good comes of it.\n\nFor thousands of years, I wandered the seashore, lamenting. I can scarcely remember those days, the black pit of despair a maw which consumed everything. I did not know of the death of my nephew, not until it was far too late. Yet my deeds and my oath set me still apart from my people, and so I came here, to Himring. Here have I dwelled since. Despite my best efforts, news of my presence became known, and some of my most foolishly loyal followers came and joined me.\n\nWe have built a life, after a fashion. Humble, yet peaceful. Yet even we hear the words carried on the wind and in the seas. The [Concept('sauroncharacter','Darkness')|E] rises anew, and the strength of the Free Peoples is not what once it was. Dare I act?"
 lotr_intro_events.0008.a:0 "I can remain secluded no more." # Rouse himself 
 lotr_intro_events.0008.b:0 "To ill end shall all things turn. I shall remain here." # Remain Melancholy

 lotr_intro_events.2001.desc:0 "Dain II Ironfoot, King Under the Mountain and the Lord of the Iron Hills has ruled these golden halls for nigh sixty years, sixty years of peace and prosperity for all Dwarvendom following the Battle of the Five Armies, the defeat of Smaug the Terrible and the tragic deaths of Thorin Oakenshield and his sister-sons.\n\nWith Erebor mostly rebuilt from the ravages of the Dragon, the Dwarves look once more beyond their borders to restore the ancient friendships with the Men of Dale and the Elves of the Greenwood, ever keeping a watchful eye to the Northern Wastes, lest any Fire-drakes still living surprise them once more."

 # Introduction to Balin
 lotr_intro_events.2002.t:0 "The Lord of Moria"
 lotr_intro_events.2002.desc:0 "Balin of the Company of Thorin Oakenshield has set out on a grand quest once more - to reclaim the ancient Dwarven capital of Khazad-Dûm from the Orcish stragglers that crawled out of their caverns once more after the fateful Battle of Azanulbizar.\n\nSetting forth from Erebor with a great company of Dwarves against the wishes of King Dain, Balin travelled South and then West along the Old Forest Road passing through danger and strife beneath the boughs of Mirkwood before finally emerging and facing a fierce fight to gain entry to Khazad-Dûm.\n\nHowever, in recent years the company's fortunes have turned. Parties go missing in the deeps of the [mistymountains|E], miners' corpses turn up lacerated, and new colonists from [erebor|E] have slowed to a trickle. And it is rumored that in the depths lurk [goblins|E] waiting for the expedition to misstep.\n\nSeeking guidance, Balin plans to gaze into the depths of the Mirrormere in the hopes of recieving a sign of what he might do to avert this slow death of his colony."

 # Introduction to Gorin of Nordinbad
 lotr_intro_events.2003.t:0 "The Lord of Nordinbad"
 lotr_intro_events.2003.desc:0 "Ever since the days of Gorin's great-grandsire, dwarves have dwelled in Nordinbad. Though the hold was never rich in terms of gold and silver, of iron it has plenty and its beauty is worth more than any mountain of gold, carefully nurtured and enhanced by the faithful Dwarves.\n\nWhile many other dwarf-holds in the Grey Mountains were consumed in Dragon-fire, the lack of conventional wealth steered the devastation away from Nordinbad's peaceful halls, and the Lords therein offered shelter to many survivors, for a time."

 # Introduction to Eldberk
 lotr_intro_events.2005.t:0 "The Lord of Nogrod"
 lotr_intro_events.2005.desc:0 "Eldberk, a mere ten winters into his life, witnessed the departure of his father to the fierce War of Dwarves and Orcs. Alas, his father found his final rest in a distant realm, denied the solace of a proper burial. A lingering bitterness took root within Eldberk's heart, for his uncle, Uri VI, returned from that grim conflict, while his father did not.\n\nDriven by a thirst for both renown and retribution, Eldberk embarked upon a daring venture alongside a fellowship, determined to reclaim the once-grand Mansion of Nogrod. Yet, fate had woven a cruel tapestry, for the Halls now lay submerged beneath unruly waters.\n\nNevertheless, the flame of ambition burned undiminished in Eldberk's breast. To emerge triumphant from the depths of adversity would not only quench his vengeful yearning but also carve his name into the annals of Dwarven lore."

 # Introduction to Uri VI
 lotr_intro_events.2006.t:0  "The Lord of Buzrâ-Dûm"
 lotr_intro_events.2006.desc:0 "The sixth reincarnation of Úri, father of the Firebeards, has ruled for countless years. Once he was a great warrior in his own right, and he participated in the War of [dwarves|E] and [orcs|E] when he was young. In that war he fought alongside with and gained the friendship of Dain 'Ironfoot', and with valor and ferocity he led the [firebeard|E] warriors at Azanulbizar.\n\nWhen the exiles of [ereborrealmshort|E] arrived in Eriador, he welcomed them to settle near his hold and funded them, earning him the moniker 'the Generous'. So he has long ruled in peace from his hall in the [bluemountains|E]. \n\nFor unlike Úri the Scarred and his previous incarnations, Úri the Sixth held in his heart great compassion in addition to the stubborness and brashness of the dwarf-fathers. He brought the syncretic belief of Kemnêl-mesêm to the Firebeards, and in his reign he fostered positive relationships with the Elves of Lindon and [broadbeams|E] to the north. \n\nNow in the last years of his life, Úri spends his time at the forge, content and happy."

 lotr_intro_events.2007.desc:0 "Brokkr II, Lord of the [broadbeams|E] of the [bluemountains|E], has ruled for just over six decades. An ill ruler he has been, and to his credit he knew it well. He drinks into the night, shirking his duties as lord to party and feast. Still the obligations of rule find Brokkr, no matter how far he runs from it, and so he has been consumed by despair and melancholy. \n\nYet for the Broadbeams, there is still glory to be won and ancient might to be reclaimed. Once mighty [belegost|E] lays in ruin, and its tunnels and caverns are ever treacherous, and to reclaim it would take great effort and time. But the Broadbeams, a stable and safe realm, can take their time. \n\nThough it fell in times long forgotten, perhaps Brokkr may redeem his name, and fallen Belegost may be recovered once again."

He would only give his blessing for his daughter to marry Aragorn if he became the High-King of Arnor and Gondor, earning the Sceptre of Annúminas he had withheld.\n\nAragorn set out into the Wild, and traveling afar did many great deeds for the Free Peoples.

Men are raised into soldiers instead of scholars; and iron is wrought into devices meant for war and nothing else.\n\nThe kingdom’s strength is waning. To the East a Great Shadow stirs. A nameless fear besieges the eastern shore. Patrols vanish without a word, and tradesmen are harried along the coasts. The decisive hour approaches, and for the kingdom of Gondor to endure it will need the likes Cirion or Ecthelion to lead its peoples.\n\nIn this hour, the burden lies upon the Steward Denethor II. He is a man loved by few, grim and stern by nature, often secluded in the White Tower. His bearing is as a king of old, shrewd and wise in his conduct and policy, and guided by his steely will Gondor has endured increasingly terrible odds. But a shadow is upon the heart of the steward, and as the long years of his watch lengthen, despair finds root within the whispering dark. \n\nUncertain, is the future of Gondor. It stands on a razor’s edge, and a single breeze could cast it down into the depths of darkness. But likewise, it could perhaps be restored to its former greatness just as quickly.

Bearing great strength and valour, he is an honourable man, with a burning desire to see his people safe from the encroaching shadow.

As their Captain, he leads the Ithilien Rangers, the forward-guard of Gondor. From the trees do his men strike, harassing and hampering the forces of the Enemy.

Yet its strategic location always led to it being re-established in times of relative peace, most recently after the White Council’s assault on Dol Guldur. \n\nMost of the Melburgi tribe have sworn to the Beornings, but some of the more impetuous and independent of mind were led north by Thegn Egica to colonise lands traditionally claimed by the Framling horselords. Egica was soon slain in a Framling raid, but his son Egico has consolidated control, retaining independence from his cousins in Melburg, the spreading Beorning hegemony, and the Éothéod remnant alike.\n\nBut the winds of change are blowing. Rumours reach Egico’s ears of goblins stirring again in the mountains, gathering horsemen in the north, and the growing ambitions of Grimbeorn. What path will Egico take in defence of his people?

Such is the nature of this exiled group of blood purists, cast out from the Haven of Umbar for their radical views. \n\nArising shortly after the arrival of Castimir the Usurper in Umbar, for years the blood-purists were merely another faction within Umbar — in fact, there is still a strong one in Umbar even after their departure. But the Ar-Adûnâim began to agitate for a great 'cleansing' of the Havens, which would bring about a restoration of Númenórean purity and be the herald of a glorious reclamation of their long-lost empire. Pragmatists in Umbar ultimately were forced to act when a rally transformed into a lynch mob that resulted in a fire which devastated a large section of the port. \n\nSince then, the Ar-Adûnâim have stewed on their rocks in the sea, awaiting the beginning of their great crusade. Their leader, Gimilkhâd, claims to have spoken with his august ancestor Ar-Pharazôn. If they keep the faith, and offer sacrifices in his name, then the Agannâlumâbâ Âru shall bring forth the Great Armament of old, and the armies of Anadûnê shall once more roll over the land."

 lotr_intro_events.7402.desc:0 "Since the days of the Kin-Strife, Umbar has been the refuge of the blood of Castamir, rightful king of Gondor. However, Umbar has been too disunified to truly pose any threat to Gondor. \n\nRoughly 30 years ago, the previous master of Umbar, Azûlzîr, began to test Gondor's defences. Gondor was not caught unaware, however, and slipping through the defences of Umbar by night, the daring captain Thorongil set the port — and the fleet — ablaze. Azûlzîr met him in personal combat as Thorongil covered his men's retreat, but Thorongil was the mightier, and slew him. \n\nThus did Kathuphazgân become lord in Umbar, but he inherited not a mighty realm, a dread across all the shores of Gondor, but one in freefall. The hinterlands, never truly brought to heel and colonised, swiftly broke away, and blood purists in Umbar started a riot which further damaged the port, leading to their exile. After many years of careful stewardship, Kathuphazgân has led Umbar back to a semblance of order, with honeyed words and judicious application of force. But he desires greater honour and glory, and to at last place his family upon the Gondorian throne. His sons are full grown and powerful men, yet there are concerns of a growing rivalry between the two concerning the succession..."

 lotr_intro_events.7403.desc:0 "Narik-Zadan was once the most ancient [numenorean|E] port in Mardruak. Yet long has it been since the great vessels of Westernesse sought this haven. In the centuries since the Downfall the coves of Mardruak have become dread harbors of the Corsairs, fierce sea-raiders who make their living from sack, pillage, and piracy. \n\nIn recent decades the corsairs of Mardruak were united under Belphêgor, a Mardrukan pirate so renowned and feared up and down the coast that he came to be known as the "Ghost of the [belegaer_sea|E]", and forged a new kingdom free from the influence [umbar|E] and [bellakar|E].\n\nAs he felt the moment of death approaching, he gave all of his children their own command, including his favoured daughter, Aglarin. Yet on his death tradition prevailed and Belphêgor’s unworthy eldest son Gôdrathor sat on the pirate throne. After two years of intrusive inspections and high-handed appropriation, Gôdrathor’s siblings rose against his unfair rule and brought his reign to an end.\n\nThe scions of Belphêgor are now captains of their own ships, and commanders of their own havens. Fiercest and most cunning is Aglarin, who rules Narik-Zadan through both fear and favour. But will she be content to remain potentate of a short stretch of coastland, or will her ambition drive her to seek her father’s throne for herself?"

But those days have long since passed, as the proud Anbalûkkhôri found themselves eclipsed by neighbouring Bellakar, and then drained by wars they could ill-afford to wage. \n\nAnd then, when it had begun to recover, the ancient Storm-King Khôrahil returned, seeking the submission of the kingdom Númenor had once ousted him from. The kings swallowed their pride and bent their necks, and thus An-Balkûmagân became the heart of the restored Thôn an-Khârlôkh, the Stormhost. \n\nBalâkhân, King of the Anbalûkkhôri, is in many ways a weak king. Raised under the regency of his mother, married to the sister of the current Storm-Marshall, while retaining the ancient rights and privileges befitting his status, he is expected to toe the line and fully support the Storm-Marshall - and thusly Khôrahil's - designs. \n\nOnly time will tell if he shall meekly follow, or if a different fate is in store for the proud Anbalûkkhôri..."

For the Prohibition of Unification, long-enshrined in the Grand Concordant, denies the right of two sovereign princes of the [balan_lai|E] to wed, to prevent the consolidation of their realms and upsetting the balance of power. And thus, Imrazôr and Arimîth are barred. Yet a glimmer of hope remains.

For in the summoned council of the year 3000, many decided they could bear him no more, and denounced him. They swore not to acknowledge the Prince's decrees until he was removed and a new one elected - and mayhaps even not then.\n\nThe [balan_lai|E] has taken a dim view of the matter, and deemed it an internal affair for Seregul to handle - no aid shall come from the west.
