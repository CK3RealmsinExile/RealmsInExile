 ## King Argeleb of Arthedain ##
 arnor.0001.t:0 "The King of Arthedain"
 arnor.0001.desc:0 "Argeleb, son of Malvegil, rules now as King of [arthedain|E] from his court at Fornost. Though he gained the throne only weeks prior, upon the death of his father, he is a proud and ambitious man, with great aspirations. Yet there is an evil that rises to the North; one that threatens to shape his reign and the fate of all [arnor|E].\n\n[rhudaur|E] has fallen, with almost the entire kingdom being overtaken by rebellious Hillmen under one Chieftain Hwaldar. It is thought he has allied himself with an evil whom none yet understand; the looming malice of [angmar|E].\n\nYet there is another matter; for Argeleb remains the only King in the north still of the line of [isildur|E], which has ended even in [cardolan|E], making him the rightful King of Arnor. It is time now for Argeleb to make an ultimate choice; shall he demand fealty as the rightful Lord of Arnor, or see to his own lands?"
 arnor.0001.a:0 "I am the King of all Arnor!"
 arnor.0001.b:0 "The [dunedain|E] still endure in Cardolan, and they may be willing subjects."
 arnor.0001.c:0 "Cardolan may do as they please, the Hillmen are our greatest threats."
 arnor.0001.d:0 "I ought to focus on my realm first. "
 
 arnor.1201.t:0 "Refugees from Rhudaur"
 arnor.1201.desc:0 "It is the late afternoon of a rather quiet day, as one of my heralds approaches my throne. \n\n "Your Grace," he says, "there are refugees arriving from Rhudaur in the east as we speak. Their leader has formally requested an audience with you." \n\nI nod, approving of the request. Soon enough, a hearty man kneels before my throne. "My King, I am [mellondir.GetFirstName], former Lord of Fennas Drúnin. Yet as you know evil has befallen that land, and the Hillmen have exiled me from my realm. I seek now only safety and refuge, O King, and I shall be a loyal servant of you, and in thy name I shall fight."\n\nI sit for a while in thought, before at last I give an answer: \n\n"Evil times are these indeed, and valiant men we shall need. You have fled, sure, yet now is not the time to dwell on such deeds which were made in haste." I rise to my feet, turning my gave upon Lord Mellondir. "Soon we shall march against Rhudaur, and any soldier shall be vital. If refuge you seek, then I grant it! May you be loyal and valiant." \n\nIt seems I have gained an unexpected ally..."
 arnor.1201.a:0 "You shall be given leave to rebuild the [GetTitleByKey('c_killarbrag').GetName]."

 arnor.3201.t:0 "Refugees from Rhudaur"
 arnor.3201.desc:0 "As I hold court on a rather bland morning, one of my heralds arrives with an urgent message. I am excited for something to distract me from my more mundane tasks and bid him to speak. \n\n"Your Grace," he says, "there are refugees arriving from Rhudaur in the east as we speak. Their leader has formally requested an audience with you." \n\nSoon enough, a stranger is brought into my throne room. He bends the knee, stating: "My King, I am [mellondir.GetFirstName], former Lord of Fennas Drúnin. Yet as you know evil has befallen that land, and the Hillmen have exiled me from my realm. I seek now only safety and refuge, Lord, and my men and I shall be bidden to you."\n\nI rise from my throne and walk down towards Lord Mellondir. \n\n"A fair sight are ye, and your men! Surely these are grave times, and evil rises its head again. Aye, you have fled, yet surely I would do the same! To die in a futile last stand is foolish, and you would do better here than as carrion for the crows." I smile warmly. "If refuge you seek, refuge you shall be granted. Let us spill hillman blood as brothers and comrades!" \n\nIt seems I have gained an unexpected ally..."
 arnor.3201.a:0 "You shall be granted the [GetTitleByKey('c_dinach').GetName]."

 ## High Lord Mellondir II of Fennas Drunin ##
 arnor.7001.t:0 "Hwaldar Attacks the Angle"
 arnor.7001.desc:0 "Ere the ascension of King [argeleb.GetFirstName] of [GetTitleByKey('k_arthedain').GetNameNoTier], an evil took [GetTitleByKey('k_rhudaur').GetNameNoTier]. The Hillmen, who long chafed under Dúnedain rule, conquered the kingdom.\n\nYet this was no normal rebellion nor seizure of power, for the Hillmen are in league with an unknown evil, and as was inevitable, have matched to war against me: the last Dúnadan Lord remaining in this land."
 arnor.7001.a:0 "War has taken these lands, and we shall not be spared."
 
 arnor.7002.t:0 "A Dilemma"
 arnor.7002.desc:0 "My spies and scouts all return with a unanimous conclusion: the odds are overwhelming. The hordes of the Hillmen now openly march against me, outnumbering our forces vastly.\n\nAt last the choice is with me: Fight, or flee. To fight is almost certain doom, yet we may still be a bastion against the Darkness. But what good is dying valorously for anyone? To flee West may be ingominious, yet it is our greatest hope for survival."
 arnor.7002.a:0 "Let them come, for we shall fight gloriously!"
 arnor.7002.b:0 "Valiant it may not be, but fleeing is the wisest choice."
 defiant_defenders:0 "Defiant Defenders"
 
 arnor.7022.t:0 "Looming Defeat"
 arnor.7022.desc:0 "I have decided to stand and fight against the vile invaders from the north, led by the brute, [hwaldar.GetFirstName], who now styles himself ruler of the [GetTitleByKey('k_rhudaur').GetName]. A pox upon him and his entire house! \n\nMy brave defenders have suffered setbacks and I begin to doubt my decision. Is there valor in a hopeless final stand? What of our wives and children, seeking refuge behind the walls of Fennas Drúnin, depending on our fleeting success? \n\nI must either steel myself for what is surely to come, or turn to the safety of the realms of Cardolan and Arthedain to the west. But can I bear the shame of fleeing from the most important fight of my life?"
 arnor.7022.a:0 "Every man able to bear a sword must be armed! We will fight!"
 arnor.7022.b:0 "I will bear the shame of defeat in order to save the innocents from slaughter."
 last_reserves:0 "Dúnedain Militia"
 
 arnor.7003.t:0 "Where To Go?"
 arnor.7003.desc:0 "Now that I have made the choice to flee, I must also choose where to seek refuge.\n\n[GetTitleByKey('k_arthedain').GetNameNoTier] is the safer choice, yet to flee so far to the court of [GetTitleByKey('c_fornost').GetNameNoTier] in itself would risk us being seen as utter cowards. \n\n[GetTitleByKey('c_thalion').GetNameNoTier], the capital of the more unstable [GetTitleByKey('k_cardolan').GetNameNoTier], meanwhile sits close to danger, yet it would almost certainly be more welcoming and King [Tarvegil.GetFirstName] would likely grant us refuge.\n\nIt is my choice now: the safety, yet indignity, of Arthedain, or the frontlines of Cardolan?"
 arnor.7003.a:0 "I shall seek refuge in Arthedain."
 arnor.7003.b:0 "I shall seek refuge in Cardolan."
 event_arnor_07003_a:0 "You will seek refuge in the capital of [GetTitleByKey('k_arthedain').GetName], [GetTitleByKey('c_fornost').GetNameNoTier]."

 arnor.7004.t:0 "The Fortress of Kings"
 arnor.7004.desc:0 "The gates swing open and I am escorted down the long narrow hallway. Before the high throne of the King I bow silently, until I am bidden to rise, and [argeleb.GetFirstName] looks upon me.\n\n"My King, I am [ROOT.Char.GetFirstName], former Lord of Fennas Drúnin. Yet as you know evil has befallen that land, and the Hillmen have exiled me from my realm. I seek now only safety and refuge, O King, and I shall be a loyal servant of you, and in thy name I shall fight."\n\nThen Argeleb sits for a while in thought, before at last he speaks again:\n\n"Evil times are these indeed, and valiant men we shall need. You have fled, sure, yet now is not the time to dwell on such deeds which were made in haste." Argeleb rises to his feet, turning to me. "Soon we shall march against Rhudaur, and any soldier shall be vital. If refuge you seek, then I grant it! May you be loyal and valiant." \n\nI breathe a sigh of relief upon hearing the King's words."

Yet as you know evil has befallen that land, and the Hillmen have exiled me from my realm. I seek now only safety and refuge, Lord, and my men and I shall be bidden to you."\n\nTarvegil rises from his throne and walks down towards me. \n\n"A fair sight are ye, and your men! Surely these are grave times, and evil rises its head again. Aye, you have fled, yet surely I would do the same!

 arnor.7011.t:0 "A New Home"
 arnor.7011.desc:0 "After arriving at the small outpost granted to my by the King, I can finally breathe a sigh of relief. Here, my family and I are safe... for now. \n\nAnd yet, my thoughts uninvitedly turn towards the East, where surely the barbaric [hwaldar.GetFirstName] still ravages the war-torn lands I once called my birthright with his hordes of brutal hillmen.\n\nI find myself wondering what I am to do in the months and years to come..."
 arnor.7011.a:0 "I shall train more men to one day reclaim [GetTitleByKey('d_dor_en_egladil').GetNameNoTier]!"
