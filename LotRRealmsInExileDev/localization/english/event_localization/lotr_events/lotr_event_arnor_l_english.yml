The Chief of Chiefs is powerful and fearsome, but he has not fully grasped the power that now stirs in the frozen north, upon the ashen plains of [angmar|E]. There, a shadow has been in ascent for the last few decades... a shadow that I have come to venerate. There is a will that guides the dark forces of the north, a will more cunning than any mere Orc. My followers have embraced the new faith that has arisen in the shadow cast by Angmar, and so have I. \n\nTime will tell if Hwaldar is wise enough to follow suit. And if he is not..."
