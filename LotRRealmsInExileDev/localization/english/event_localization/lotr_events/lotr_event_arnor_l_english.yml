 arnor.7001.desc:0 "Ere the ascension of King [argeleb.GetFirstName] of [GetTitleByKey('k_arthedain').GetNameNoTier], an evil took [GetTitleByKey('k_rhudaur').GetNameNoTier]. The Hillmen, who long chafed under Dúnedain rule, conquered the kingdom.\n\nYet this was no normal rebellion nor seizure of power, for the Hillmen are in league with an unknown evil, and as was inevitable, have matched to war against me: the last Dúnadan Lord remaining in this land."

The hordes of the Hillmen now openly march against me, outnumbering our forces vastly.\n\nAt last the choice is with me: Fight, or flee. To fight is almost certain doom, yet we may still be a bastion against the Darkness. But what good is dying valorously for anyone? To flee West may be ingominious, yet it is our greatest hope for survival."

A pox upon him and his entire house! \n\nMy brave defenders have suffered setbacks and I begin to doubt my decision. Is there valor in a hopeless final stand? What of our wives and children, seeking refuge behind the walls of Fennas Drúnin, depending on our fleeting success? \n\nI must either steel myself for what is surely to come, or turn to the safety of the realms of Cardolan and Arthedain to the west. But can I bear the shame of fleeing from the most important fight of my life?"

Yet as you know evil has befallen that land, and the Hillmen have exiled me from my realm. I seek now only safety and refuge, O King, and I shall be a loyal servant of you, and in thy name I shall fight."\n\nThen Argeleb sits for a while in thought, before at last he speaks again:\n\n"Evil times are these indeed, and valiant men we shall need. You have fled, sure, yet now is not the time to dwell on such deeds which were made in haste." Argeleb rises to his feet, turning to me.

Surely these are grave times, and evil rises its head again. Aye, you have fled, yet surely I would do the same! To die in a futile last stand is foolish, and you would do better here than as carrion for the crows." He smiles warmly. "If refuge you seek, refuge you shall be granted.
