 yellow_mountain_orc.001.desc:0 "When our first scouts gave their reports on Amazûn, some in my court decried the tunnels as cursed. It is a labyrinth of web and teeth, a forest of silk far beneath the earth where dread things creep in the shadows. Many that explored that deep place never returned... \n\n ...but that is not all that Amazûn is. The Web-Weald is also a place of plenty. Trapped in those very webs that my courtiers feared is meat! Bountiful meat! It seems that animals atop the mountain above frequently stumble into crevices in the cavern's ceiling. Unable to escape, they accumulate here, kept fresh in silken cocoons. \n\n The spiders themselves are enormous, as vicious as they are cunning. Though terrifying, to be sure, they may yet be tamed, or else bargained with. They will be a powerful weapon against the enemies of Enânagosnî."

 yellow_mountain_orc.002.t:0 "The Lowland Migration"
 yellow_mountain_orc.002.desc:0 "As long as any can remember, our people have been at home in the mountains. When the sea-people left Sarûl, we dared to creep into the foothills, where we long remained. Raiding the shattered remains of Tantûrak was easy, but never particularly ambitious. Our people never grew, our holdings never expanded. \n\n Now, at last, we delve the dark jungles of the Ûsakan and find that we are at home in them. Each passing day, more of the forest is felled and more settlements are raised. With Tantûrak secured, we now have a base from which to raid far abroad. A dread future is before us."

 yellow_mountain_orc.003.t:0 "The Summit of the Great Forge"
 yellow_mountain_orc.003.desc:0 "Long ago, Ulkhásh the Ashen led our ancestors to invade the Yellow Mountains. He raised the great mountains of fire to destroy the vile [dwarves|E] that lived there, slaughtering them in the thousands, claiming for himself the Black Throne and the Obsidian Crown in the deep. At the moment of his victory, however, Ulkhásh was murdered by the dwarves, and his blood became the molten earth that courses through the depths of the earth, while his bones became the black Obsidian that cuts those it hates. \n\n In the chaos of his defeat, the fire-mountains became wild, thought to be untameable, but we have at last leashed the flame. We have offered blood and gold to the fire, and constructed a great forge amidst the magma heart of the mountain. Ulkhásh has seen this, and has rewarded us. Shards of razor-sharp obsidian fill these halls in abundance, ready to be made into weapons and armor."
