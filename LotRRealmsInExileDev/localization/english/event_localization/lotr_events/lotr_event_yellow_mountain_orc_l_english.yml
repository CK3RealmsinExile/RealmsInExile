 yellow_mountain_orc.001.t: "The Web-Weald of Amazûn"
 yellow_mountain_orc.001.desc: "When our first scouts gave their reports on Amazûn, some in my court decried the tunnels as cursed. It is a labyrinth of web and teeth, a forest of silk far beneath the earth where dread things creep in the shadows. Many that explored that deep place never returned... \n\n ...but that is not all that Amazûn is. The Web-Weald is also a place of plenty. Trapped in those very webs that my courtiers feared is meat! Bountiful meat! It seems that animals atop the mountain above frequently stumble into crevices in the cavern's ceiling. Unable to escape, they accumulate here, kept fresh in silken cocoons. \n\n The spiders themselves are enormous, as vicious as they are cunning. Though terrifying, to be sure, they may yet be tamed, or else bargained with. They will be a powerful weapon against the enemies of Enânagosnî."
 yellow_mountain_orc.001.a: "A new home in the dark."
 
 yellow_mountain_orc.002.t: "The Lowland Migration"
 yellow_mountain_orc.002.desc: "As long as any can remember, our people have been at home in the mountains. When the sea-people left Sarûl, we dared to creep into the foothills, where we long remained. Raiding the shattered remains of Tantûrak was easy, but never particularly ambitious. Our people never grew, our holdings never expanded. \n\n Now, at last, we delve the dark jungles of the Ûsakan and find that we are at home in them. Each passing day, more of the forest is felled and more settlements are raised. With Tantûrak secured, we now have a base from which to raid far abroad. A dread future is before us."
 yellow_mountain_orc.002.a: "A new evil stirs in Tantûrak."
 
 yellow_mountain_orc.003.t: "The Summit of the Great Forge"
 yellow_mountain_orc.003.desc: "Long ago, Ulkhásh the Ashen led our ancestors to invade the [yellowmountains|E]. He raised the great mountains of fire to destroy the vile [dwarves|E] that lived there, slaughtering them in the thousands, claiming for himself the Black Throne and the Obsidian Crown in the deep. At the moment of his victory, however, Ulkhásh was murdered by the dwarves, and his blood became the molten earth that courses through the depths of the earth, while his bones became the black Obsidian that cuts those it hates. \n\n In the chaos of his defeat, the fire-mountains became wild, thought to be untameable, but we have at last leashed the flame. We have offered blood and gold to the fire, and constructed a great forge amidst the magma heart of the mountain. Ulkhásh has seen this, and has rewarded us. Shards of razor-sharp obsidian fill these halls in abundance, ready to be made into weapons and armor."
 yellow_mountain_orc.003.a: "An obsidian army."
 
 yellow_mountain_orc.004.t: "Raising the Snagazat"
 yellow_mountain_orc.004.desc: "I walk amidst the ruins of what was once Barazimabûl. Where once there were grand boulevards and towering statues now stand only broken halls and crumbling mines. We have crushed the [blacklocks|E] and cast them in chains by the thousands, but they are of no use to us dead. They could be made to toil in the mines, it is true, but there are other uses for such a labor force. No, they will be kept contained, within a great prison-fortress, a dungeon of terrible fear. This citadel will be our capital, a lingering symbol of our victory over the dwarves. What purpose will the Snagazat serve?"
 yellow_mountain_orc.004.a: "It will be a fighting pit, where warrior-slaves will battle for our pleasure."
 yellow_mountain_orc.004.b: "These slaves will fetch a price in An-Balkûmagân and the Bôzisha-Dâr."
 yellow_mountain_orc.004.c: "Her purpose is misery alone. Let all fear to join the wretches there."
 
 yellow_mountain_orc.101.t: "Ny Cénnacatt: Tunnel Blockage"
 yellow_mountain_orc.101.desc: "'News from below, m'lord' The servant fills me in on the excavation work in the tunnels below Ny Cénnacatt. Initially, progress was swift. Several gates in the deepest dungeons had been sealed from the outside, the locks melted to prevent entry; nothing a few hammers and picks couldn't crack. Within: vast winding catacombs. Some passages were unstable, or had collapsed, but the excavation team set to work clearing the tunnels and making them safe for further delving.\n\nAs my workers have gone deeper, however, they've found more and more collapsed halls. Progress has slowed to a halt as the team finds themselves not as much clearing rubble, but mining entirely new passages. They have not the tools nor manpower to excavate everything, but the overseers aren't sure which passages are worth pursuing."
 yellow_mountain_orc.101.a: "Where there's a whip, there's a way!"
 yellow_mountain_orc.101.b: "They need new tools, and more of them."
 yellow_mountain_orc.101.c: "Focus your attention on these staircases."
 
 yellow_mountain_orc.102.t: "Ny Cénnacatt: Buried Horrors"
 yellow_mountain_orc.102.desc: "The excavation of Ny Cénnacatt pushes ever onward. With the tunnel blockages cleared, my diggers have discovered an entirely new sublevel of the fortress. Ancient barracks, armouries, and dread laboratories dive endlessly into black pits in the mountain. Forges fed by subterranean magma bathe the whole floor in a sweltering heat, and black smoke belches unholy fumes. Libraries too, there are, filled with ancient and terrible knowledge. This is the place that we came for. In a moment of misplaced excitement, the chief overseer of the project commanded the dig-team to split up, and to gather any loot that they could find in the labyrinthian halls. None returned.\n\nI gather my personal guard and join the chief overseer in the lower deep. It doesn't take long for the culprits to show themselves. The air shifts, suddenly, from burning volcanic heat to soul-chilling cold. A rasping voice calls out in a dead language, as skeletal hands grasp for rusted blades. Only one word is discernible '[khorahil|E]'."
 yellow_mountain_orc.102.a: "Halt! I am your master!"
 yellow_mountain_orc.102.b: "Archers! In position!"
 yellow_mountain_orc.102.c: "I will let them know death."
 
 yellow_mountain_orc.103.t: "Ny Cénnacatt: Shadows of the Past"
 yellow_mountain_orc.103.desc: "With the wights dealt with, the fortress is ours, at last. I send my soldiers to clear the rest of the floor, and to gather anything useful, as I make my way to [khorahil|E]'s personal library. Of course, it requires a keen eye to find diamonds amidst decay- most of what was left here rotted to dust centuries ago.\n\nMy torchlight passes over shelf after shelf of ancient tomes, tattered scrolls, and occult grimoires. These writings no doubt tell of the [stormhost|E], of the shadowy cults that were born there, and of dark truths revealed to the [ringwraith|E]. It could take centuries to read everything here; if I am to make any progress, I ought to find a topic to focus on."
 yellow_mountain_orc.103.a: "Of Shadow and the Mystic Arts of Yóm"
 yellow_mountain_orc.103.b: "Of War and the Battle-Frenzy of Shyra"
 yellow_mountain_orc.103.c: "Of Death and the Assassins of Taimaraud"
 yellow_mountain_orc.103.d: "Bah! What use have I for dusty scrolls? I'm here for loot."
 
 yellow_mountain_orc.104.t: "Ny Cénnacatt: The Mystic Arts of Yóm"
 yellow_mountain_orc.104.desc: "A pile of scrolls and tomes around me, I begin my research. In the days before the establishment of the [stormhost|E], [khorahil|E] tried many times to take Sîrayn by force, riling up the [orcs|E] of the Yellow Mountains to pillage the lowlands. Though effective in sowing random destruction, the orcs could not hold the land for long. He instead required a plan with cunning.\n\nKhôrahil learned of the goddess Yóm, weaver of dreams and mother of magic. A practitioner of sorcery himself, he knew all too well how to entice her followers. Using the instability of the orcish invasion, the Blind Sorcerer presented himself as a teacher, promising to give the Yómani the power necessary to protect themselves from foreign threats. As anticipated, the cult welcomed the Nazgûl with open arms.\n\nAstoundingly, a single grimoire of these arcane rites still remains intact."
 yellow_mountain_orc.104.a: "The Rites of Yóm are fascinating..."
 yellow_mountain_orc.104.b: "The grimoire alone will do."
 
 yellow_mountain_orc.105.t: "Ny Cénnacatt: The Battle-Frenzy of Shyra"
 yellow_mountain_orc.105.desc: "A pile of scrolls and tomes around me, I begin my research. In the days before the establishment of the [stormhost|E], [khorahil|E] tried many times to take Sîrayn by force, riling up the [orcs|E] of the Yellow Mountains to pillage the lowlands. Though effective in sowing random destruction, the orcs could not hold the land for long. He instead required a plan with cunning.\n\nKhôrahil knew of the warlike Bulgan and their lion-goddess Shyra. Patron of storms, catastrophe, and rage, it was all too easy for the Nazgûl to pass himself off as her emissary. Stoking their anger and resentment, Khôrahil promised to build the Bulgan into a lethal fighting force, capable of not only pushing back the orcish invaders, but of taking back the empire that they once held in Sîrayn.\n\nAmong the books is a military manual penned by a general of the Stormhost, which details the strategies once used by the Storm-King."
 yellow_mountain_orc.105.a: "To fight like the She-Lion herself..."
 yellow_mountain_orc.105.b: "There are some good techniques here."
 
 yellow_mountain_orc.106.t: "Ny Cénnacatt: The Assassins of Taimaraud"
 yellow_mountain_orc.106.desc: "A pile of scrolls and tomes around me, I begin my research. In the days before the establishment of the [stormhost|E], [khorahil|E] tried many times to take Sîrayn by force, riling up the [orcs|E] of the Yellow Mountains to pillage the lowlands. Though effective in sowing random destruction, the orcs could not hold the land for long. He instead required a plan with cunning.\n\nTaking advantage of the devastation wrought by the orcs, the Blind Sorcerer came before the lords of Sîrayn as an emissary of Taimaraud, the Tayee god of judgement and law. With their support, he would organize a force of religious warriors to drive out the orcs and free Sîrayn. Now firmly in control of both sides of the conflict, it was effortless to complete the farce. The newly organized Tayb drove the orcs back to the mountains, and were celebrated as liberators. Khôrahil then used the Tayb to assassinate the very lords he manipulated into creating them, seizing total control of eastern Sîrayn. In time, Taimaraud would be known not as a god of law, but as a god of murder and death."
 yellow_mountain_orc.106.a: "What else can the Tayb teach me?"
 yellow_mountain_orc.106.b: "A cunning plan, indeed."
