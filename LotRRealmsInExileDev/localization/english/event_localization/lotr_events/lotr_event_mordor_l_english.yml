 mordor.1000.t:0 "The Long Peace"
 mordor.1000.desc:0 "[mordor|E] slumbers. We bide our time and prepare this land for the return of our master, [sauroncharacter|E] who rests at [GetTitleByKey('c_amon_lanc').GetNameNoTier], gathering His strength in secret.\n\nThe Dark Land is divided into two parts; the north is dominated by [orcs|E], ruled by the [nazgul|E], while in the south the Núrniags keep the endless masses of Núrnhot slaves in line that work the fields feeding our vast armies.\n\nAs Lord of the Nine, it is my duty to bring order to Mordor and make sure all is ready for our Master. There are multiple avenues that reveal themselves to me.\n\nI could strengthen the defences at [GetTitleByKey('c_morannon').GetNameNoTier] and [GetTitleByKey('minas_ithil').GetNameNoTier] to guard against any outside threat. While [gondor|E] has yet to attempt to reclaim Minas Morgul, we cannot let the Stewards gather their strength for too long.\n\nOn the other hand, I could focus on drilling the bickering tribes of [orcs|E] into a formidable combat force; ending the infighting and fostering a breed worthy of Mordor.\n\nMy third option concerns [GetTitleByKey('k_nurn').GetNameNoTier], where the arrogant Núrniags dwell. The supplies gathered on their slave fields are essential, but humbling them and taking a more direct approach to the slave economy might end up beneficial in the long term..."

 mordor.1001.desc:0 "Our efforts have not been in vain. The entrances into [mordor|E] are now closely watched and well-defended.\n\nWe have strenghtened the fortifications and gathered siege supplies; and the gates and walls are manned with the strongest amongst the [orcs|E]. Whoever may come to challenge our defences shall find it quite difficult to force entry into the Land of Shadows!\n\nAs content as I am with this recent success, I cannot forget that there is always more work to be done. Soon I shall make my next move to ensure Mordor is ready for the return of its true Master..."

Much time has been spent on selective breeding and intense training to forge the [orcs|E] of [mordor|E] into a force capable of smiting the Lords of the West when called upon. When the time comes, war shall ravage the lands of [gondor|E] and beyond, and the orcs shall be at the forefront of the fighting, where now they will thrive.\n\nAs content as I am with this recent success, I cannot forget that there is always more work to be done. Soon I shall make my next move to ensure Mordor is ready for the return of its true Master..."

 mordor.1003.desc:0 "The pride of the Núrniags is at an end. Reduced to [duke|E]s under my direct control, they will fall in line with the changes I have ordained or see themselves be stripped of even the last amount of power they have been left with.\n\nNo longer will the wealth of Núrn be spent on wasteful displays of pride but be transferred directly into our warchest and into the supply dumps for the hosts of [mordor|E].\n\nAs content as I am with this recent success, I cannot forget that there is always more work to be done. Soon I shall make my next move to ensure Mordor is ready for the return of its true Master..."

 mordor.1005.desc:0 "At long last [mordor|E] has been restored as the domain of [sauronthedarklordcharacter|E]. In His wisdom, he has seen fit to reward my loyalty by granting me command of His armies, reinstating me as the Lord of Minas Morgul.\n\nAs I look to the west across the Great River on to [gondor|E] and its White City, I find myself eagerly awaiting the day my Master allows me to unleash the Host of Morgul against what remains of Gondor's might.\n\nSoon, our enemies will fall before the shadow of Mordor."
 mordor.1005.a:0 "I must make ready for war."
