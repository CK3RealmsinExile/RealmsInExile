 mordor.1000.t:0 "The Long Peace"
 mordor.1000.desc:0 "[mordor|E] slumbers. We bide our time and prepare this land for the return of our master, [sauroncharacter|E] who rests at [GetTitleByKey('c_amon_lanc').GetNameNoTier], gathering His strength in secret.\n\nMordor, as of now, is a divided land. In the north, we servants of Sauron rule over the savage and bickering Orcs, while in the south, the slave-force Núrniags feeds our armies. Yet there is much work to be done ere the Black Tower may rise anew, and as Lord of the Nine, it is my duty to do it. There are multiple avenues that reveal themselves to me.\n\nIn the west, the Stewards of [gondor|E] gather their strength. Many centuries ago I took Minas Ithil from them, and though they have launched no attempt to reclaim it, they still pose a threat. The defences at [GetTitleByKey('c_morannon').GetNameNoTier] and [GetTitleByKey('minas_ithil').GetNameNoTier] must be bolstered if we are to guard against any outside threat, and their black walls shall be a bulwark against the enemies of Sauron.\n\nYet this strategy is wholly defensive. I could focus on drilling the bickering tribes of [orcs|E] into a formidable combat force, ending the infighting and fostering a breed worthy of Mordor; and so this new army could be both the spear and shield of Mordor.\n\nTo the west lies [GetTitleByKey('k_ithilien').GetNameNoTier], Garden of Gondor, with its rich timber ressources we could plunder.\n\n\n\nMy third option concerns [GetTitleByKey('k_nurn').GetNameNoTier], where the arrogant Núrniags dwell. The supplies gathered on their slave fields are essential, but humbling them and taking a more direct approach to the slave economy might end up beneficial in the long term..."
 mordor.1000.desc.a:0 "I have undertaken the first steps in preparing [mordor|E] for the return of [sauroncharacter|E], but there may be more work that needs to be done.\n\nI must ensure the Dark Land is ready for its rightful master!"
 mordor.1000.a:0 "I shall forge the orcs into a true fighting force!"
 mordor.1000.a.tt:0 "Unlocks a decision to raise a formidable army"
 mordor.1000.b:0 "Let us despoil Ithilien, Garden of [gondor|e]."
 mordor.1000.b.tt:0 "Unlocks a decision to expand your reach into [GetTitleByKey('k_ithilien').GetNameNoTier]"
 mordor.1000.d:0 "The Núrniags must be humbled and stripped of their pride."

 mordor.1000.c:0 "Strengthen our defences lest our enemies lay siege to Mordor."
 mordor.1000.c.tt:0 "Unlocks a decision to fortify the entraces to Mordor"
 mordor.1000.e:0 "We have achieved much. Send word to the Master..."
 mordor.1000.e.tt:0 "Unlocks a decision to call on [sauroncharacter|E] to return to Mordor"
 
 mordor.1001.t:0 "Mordor Fortified"
 mordor.1001.desc:0 "Our efforts have not been in vain. Every hill is watched now, every entrance into [mordor|E] well-defended.\n\nWe have strenghtened the fortifications and gathered siege supplies; and the gates and walls are manned with the strongest amongst the [orcs|E]. The black walls of our fortresses are higher than ever, our gates fortified with iron and steel. Our walls shall not be breached, our garrisons shall not falter, our lands shall be defiled by none but us!\n\nBut as content as I am with this recent success, I cannot forget that there is always more work to be done. Soon I shall make my next move to ensure Mordor is ready for the return of its true Master..."

 mordor.1002.t:0 "Rise of the Morgul-host"
 mordor.1002.desc:0 "The Host of Morgul stands ready. Much time has been spent on selective breeding and intense training to forge the [orcs|E] of [mordor|E] into a force capable of smiting the Lords of the West when called upon. Neither sun nor rain shall hinder them, they are strong and tall, but swift in movement and precise in their attacks. When the time comes, war shall ravage the lands of [gondor|E] and beyond, and the orcs shall be at the forefront of the fighting.\n\nAs content as I am with this recent success, I cannot forget that there is always more work to be done. Soon I shall make my next move to ensure Mordor is ready for the return of its true Master..."
 mordor.1002.a:0 "I will unleash the Morgul-host in time..."

 mordor.1003.t:0 "Núrn Reorganized"
 mordor.1003.desc:0 "The pride of the Núrniags is at an end. Reduced to [duke|E]s under my direct control, they will fall in line with the changes I have ordained or see themselves be stripped of even the last amount of power they have been left with.\n\nNo longer will the wealth of Núrn be spent on wasteful displays of pride but be transferred directly into our warchest and into the supply dumps for the hosts of [mordor|E]. No longer will we have to bargain with the foolhardy and wealthy lords who have grown rich off their armies of slaves, and no longer will any ambitious upstart have a chance to deprive our armies of food. Now the slaves toil directly in the name of the Dark Lord, and none other!\n\nAs content as I am with this recent success, I cannot forget that there is always more work to be done. Soon I shall make my next move to ensure Mordor is ready for the return of its true Master..."

 mordor.1004.t:0 "The Dark Lord's Return"
 mordor.1004.desc:0 "The time has come. [mordor|E] has been sufficiently prepared for the return of its rightful Master. Now, He is approaching.\n\nHe shall remake the Dark Tower and proclaim Himself openly as the Lord of Mordor. Let the flames of Orodruin erupt at the sight of His coming, and let the Lords of the West who have stood against His might tremble in their halls and fortresses. Their time will come soon enough.\n\nLet the earth shudder and roar at the coming of its rightful lord: [sauronthedarklordcharacter|E], Lord of the Rings, Lord of the Earth!"
 mordor.1004.a:0 "I pass the rule of Mordor to my Master."
 
 mordor.1005.t:0 "Fate of the Witch-king"
 mordor.1005.desc:0 "It is time. "The hour has come, Mûrazôr, First of the Nine."\n\nI bow before [sauroncharacter|E], sat upon his Dark Throne in the innermost sanctum of the Dark Tower.\n\n"Thy deeds have been well wrought. Now the Dark Tower is arisen anew, and a new purpose I have set for thee. Minas Morgul, thy conquest, shall be thy new abode in my service. From thence my armies thou shalt command, until the time comes when thou shalt assault [gondor|E] as I order."\n\nI bow, and look to the west, to the pale walls of distant Minas Morgul. Soon, our enemies will fall before the shadow of Mordor.\n\n"Go now, Mûrazôr, for thus I have decreed," my master dismisses me."
 mordor.1005.a:0 "I must make ready for war."
 mordor.1005.b:0 "My Master now has much work to do..."
 
 mordor.1006.t:0 "The Call of Mordor"
 mordor.1006.desc:0 "At the dead of night he arrives out of the starless skies. His winged fellbeast lands and bows before me, and the rider dismounts and follows suit. I bid him speak.\n\n"I bring word from [mordor|E], your Excellence." Says he, Khamûl, Second of the Nine. "It is prepared for you, Lord, and ready for thy arrival. The Dark Tower is ready to rise anew, at thy bidding."\n\nIs it time for me to return to Mordor, and raise the Black Tower once more, and reveal myself to all? Or ought I bide my time, and wait until the hour would be better for my arrival?"
 mordor.1006.a:0 "It is time to return to [mordor|E]."
 mordor.1006.b:0 "The time has not yet come..."
 
 mordor.1007.t:0 "Ithilien Burns"
 mordor.1007.desc:0 "Torch-bearing [orcs|E] swarm the so-called Garden of [gondor|E], burning and hacking as they please. Ithilien is being despoiled with every day that passes.\n\nGreat logging camps have been constructed and the timber is put to good use in the siege workshops of Udûn. Soon, the orcish war machine will become truy unstoppable.\n\nAs content as I am with this recent success, I cannot forget that there is always more work to be done. Soon I shall make my next move to ensure Mordor is ready for the return of its true Master..."

 mordor.1008.t:0 "Ordering My Realm"
 mordor.1008.desc:0 "It has taken an entire age, but at long last, [mordor|E] is mine once more. And while [witchking.GetName] has done well in preparing the land for my return, there are still a few tasks left for myself to deal with.\n\nOne of these concerns the fate of [GetTitleByKey('k_nurn').GetNameNoTier]. The Witch-king has humbled the proud Núrniags in order to improve productivity. I could reverse this decision and restore their line of Kings, ensuring their unwavering loyalty... but as my most trusted servant has correctly pointed out, this would lead to a certain decrease in foodstuffs produced.\n\nI could also simply uphold the status quo and administer Núrn myself, or take an evern more radical approach by binding its rulers more directly to the beating heart of Mordor - the Dark Tower of Barad-Dûr..."
 mordor.1008.a:0 "Núrn will be dismantled even further."
 mordor.1008.b:0 "I shall restore the Núrniags as Kings."
 mordor.1008.c:0 "We shall uphold the status quo."

Now, in a twist of fate unexpected even by the wisest, [sauronthedarklordcharacter|E] has once again made the Land of Shadows his domain, openly proclaiming his rule over it.\n\nThe fires of Mount Doom erupt in a violent explosion as Sauron begins to rebuild his Dark Tower.
