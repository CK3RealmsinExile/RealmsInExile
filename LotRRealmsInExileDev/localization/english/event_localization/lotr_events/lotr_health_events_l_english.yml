 lotr_health_events.3001.desc_intro: "In my hand mirror, I gaze upon the bandages that have covered my face throughout my long recovery. During my healing, I was forbidden from seeing what lay beneath them, no matter how much I protested. I was told there would be plenty of time to see my new face once the healing process was complete. I finally peel off the wrappings, only to realize I don't recognize the person staring back at me in the mirror."
