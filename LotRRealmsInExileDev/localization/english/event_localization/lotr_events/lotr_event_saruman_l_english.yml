 ### SARUMAN EVENTS ###
 saruman.0001.t:0 "The Lord of Isengard"
 saruman.0001.desc:0 "[title_c_isengard.GetNameNoTier] was not made by you, but by the Men of Númenor long ago. The tower is very tall and has many secrets, yet it looks not to be a work of craft, but a great rock spire cast out by the ancient hills.\n\nIt was at the crowning of [frealaf.GetName] that you appeared, bringing gifts, and speaking great praise of the valour of the Rohirrim. All knew you a welcome guest. Soon after you took up your abode in Isengard, for [beren.GetName], had granted you the keys to Orthanc; and from that year of 2759 T.A. you have dwelt in Isengard.\n\nYou became a lord of Men; for at first you held Isengard as a lieutenant of the Steward and warden of the tower. Fréaláf was as glad as Beren to have this so, and knew that Isengard was in the hands of a strong friend. A friend you long were, and you kept the tower as part of the defences of the West, so long as you yourself remained the chief person in that defence, and the head of its council.\n\nYour subjects are of the Rohirrim and Dunlending, and no longer do you consider the [denethor.GetPrimaryTitle.GetName] as your liege."
 saruman.0001.a:0 "The rule of Isengard is now mine, as are its secrets."
 saruman.0001.a.tt:0 "You are no longer a vassal of the Lord of Minas Tirith."
 saruman.0001.a.tt2:0 "You have access to the Orthanc palantír, a seeing stone."
 saruman.0001.a.tt3:0 "You may use the palantír via an initial, major decision and continue to use it via a minor decision."
 saruman.0001.b:0 "I shall remain a vassal of [denethor.GetNameNoTooltip]."
 saruman.0001.b.tt:0 "You remain a vassal of the Lord of Minas Tirith."

 decision_saruman_palantir_introduction_desc:0 "The palantír, when used by someone of great strength of will and mind, can be directed to show objects and events far away. Between two palantír stones it allows visual communication."

 saruman.0002.t:0 "The Orthanc Stone"
 saruman.0002.desc:0 "In the middle of your throne-room is a black stand. On it, a black cloth covering the palantír, the greatest of the secrets of Isengard.\n\nGandalf would advise you to disregard its power. The grey fool miscalculates your wisdom and strength.\n\nSauron has a palantír: the captured Ithil Stone of Minas Ithil. That is guessed correctly by you. In the past you have felt his gaze on Isengard. But you are powerful enough to resist him, shrouding your valley in secrecy from his eye.\n\nIn this hour you will wrestle with Sauron and claim mastery over this powerful tool and use it in your quest."
 saruman.0002.a:0 "I will find the One Ring. And bring order to Middle-earth."
 saruman.0002.a.tt:0 "You gaze into the palantír."
 saruman.0002.b:0 "To gaze into the palantír is folly; Sauron seeks me."
 saruman.0002.b.tt:0 "You do not gaze into the palantír yet."
 
 saruman.0003.t:0 "The Palantír"
 saruman.0003.desc:0 "In the darkness of your throne room, the black cloth is lifted, and you reach out towards the crystal ball and command it to show you the One Ring. It respects your power and sweeps over the Gladden Fields. The scene is visible, a wilderness of marshlands where you have searched ceaselessly to discover the Ring. It is not there. You search further and are directed over Mirkwood and towards the Sea of Rhûn, where you observe the Men of Rhûn and their works, but someone else is watching.\n\nSauron has found you. You perceive the form of a great eye, lidless and wreathed in flame. Within his fortress of Barad-dûr the Lord of Mordor sees you with the captured Ithil Stone, and his reaching flames pierce through the palantír and grasp you, seeking to infiltrate your mind and learn your designs. As the palantír shows you Sauron's utter conquest of the East and the South, you realise that Sauron does not yet know of your search for the One Ring that brought you to his attention. You must deceive him by feigning allegiance, or match his will and fight for control of the palantír."
 saruman.0003.a:0 "Saruman pledges allegiance to you, lord Sauron."
 saruman.0003.a.tt:0 "Pledge allegiance to Sauron, convert to the Cult of the Lidless Eye. Continue your search to claim the One Ring."
 saruman.0003.b:0 "You shall not have the Orthanc Stone, Dark Lord."
 saruman.0003.b.tt:0 "Strive against Sauron, wrest control over the Orthanc Stone."

 saruman.0004.t:0 "$saruman.0002.t$"
 saruman.0004.desc:0 "It waits. Impatient. Calling, covered in cloth, preventing the eye from coming forth. The palantír is a dangerous tool, its use is folly.\n\nThere are but two options here, in the fashion of the Dúnedain: I could set a trusted guard over this artifact, the temptation and fear within me would vanish; I might also keep it in the archive of Orthanc, buried dark and deep in the library, safe, unused, except at dire purpose."
 saruman.0004.a:0 "Set a watch."
 saruman.0004.a.tt:0 "You set a palantír-room watch, Isengarders recruited from the Ring of Orthanc Guard, selecting those most reticent of temperament. This will calm your nerves over the matter."
 saruman.0004.b:0 "I must be rid of it."

 saruman.0005.desc:0 "In your wisdom, forgoing the use of a palantír and using one of the sturdy Isengarder horse breeds, you make ready to travel the distance between [title_c_isengard.GetNameNoTier] and the [title_c_minas_tirith.GetNameNoTier].\n\n[gondor_holder.GetName] has many matters to attend to, yet he submits one day to you, Chief of the Istari and most prominent of the Wise, for you will come bearing a gift of arms from the Tower of Orthanc for the protection of the Ivory Tower.\n\nIn visiting, you wish to spread your influence in Minas Tirith, and through your contacts and spies within Gondor, you have the recommendation of twenty petty lords of [title_k_anorien.GetNameNoTier], people whose ancestors trace back to the Gwathuirim and Gondorians of ancient Calenardhon. These are people you trust to bring you renown through their worthiness to the elite Citadel Guard of Minas Tirith. Yet they are in the jurisdiction of [gondor_holder.GetName], and no doubt their available prowess is already known to them.\n\nYou need a grander gesture of self-importance.\n\nPerhaps, as you ride in splendour through the gates of Minas Tirith and round each level of the city, behind you ride the black horses of twenty Isengarders, clad in black robes and glittering mail. Each guardian of Orthanc bearing a tower shield and long-bladed spear; to the city dwellers, they are equal in pride for their heritage. Hand-picked by you, spreading more than simple influence here. For in an hour of need, they will be invaluable to the defence of [title_c_minas_tirith.GetNameNoTier]."

Yet those days are behind us, these people cared little for the great war against the Dark Lord, and I sense agents from Sauron have met with some, attempting to turn them into servants of the darkness.\n\nI could show a display of might and wisdom, consolidating a few of the Dunlending tribes, letting their people settle in my lands and protect them from evil."
 saruman.0007.a:0 "Former subjects of Gondor, not of the Istari."

One by one my captains are felled from their horses and finished off by crooked blades. I ride hard to the east only to be stopped by a wall of pikemen. They strike and stab at me. All goes dark.\n\nSome hours later - perhaps days - I see a blinding light and shadows dancing in the river, figures picking through the dead, searching for something or something. Suddenly I become weightless, picked up and placed atop what I presume to be a horse, and as we begin to move everything returns to darkness."

I faintly know I need to do something, but what? I am so tired, I want nothing more than to rest... \n\nSilently, I slip away, the last thoughts of my mind dwelling upon my beloved king and father, and the plight of our kingdom." #Théodred Dies in his sleep

After the proceedings are done, I dismiss the people, and slowly they go away, my niece and nephew last among them. \n\nAt last the tears begin to flow, a hand upon my face as I gaze upon the mound of my beloved son, so proud and strong, yet so kind and noble. The old linger and the young perish - what justice is this?" #Théoden buries Théodred.

The White Wizard has grown reclusive of late, and could this be his work? \n\nGrima counsels me to wait, send out emissaries and be cautious, for has Saruman not long been a faithful warden of the western border? Meanwhile my nephew Éomer is much more direct, saying that if he has not betrayed us utterly, he is worthless as a warden. How else could such a force have crossed our border but by his complicit consent? If nothing else, Isengard must be taken and fortified anew, to prevent such future incursions. \n\nWhatever awaits us in the Westfold, we shall ride in strength to shatter it."

In mere moments his years of preparation, painstakingly hidden, have been undone by a force he had never thought to factor into his plans. \n\nHe is safe enough in the Orthanc, but what remains of his armies are quickly being smashed beneath the terrible fury of the Onodrim. Just when it seems things cannot get any worse, the Ents break the great dam that had been erected upon the Isen. All at once, the reservoir of water comes rushing forth in a mighty wave, a small recreation of Akallabêth. And just as pride had brought low the Númenóreans, so too have all the works of Saruman's cunning mind of steel now been unmade by the fury of nature. \n\nHe is now a prisoner within what once was his seat of power."

Saruman is now a prisoner within his own tower, the Ents having hunted down every last Uruk-hai in the region. \n\nThe Children of Yavanna have dealt a decisive blow against the darkness this day."
