 ### SARUMAN EVENTS ###
 saruman.0001.t:0 "The Lord of Isengard"
 saruman.0001.desc:0 "[title_c_isengard.GetNameNoTier] was not made by you, but by the Men of Númenor long ago. The tower is very tall and has many secrets, yet it looks not to be a work of craft, but a great rock spire cast out by the ancient hills.\n\nIt was at the crowning of [frealaf.GetName] that you appeared, bringing gifts, and speaking great praise of the valour of the Rohirrim. All knew you a welcome guest. Soon after you took up your abode in Isengard, for [beren.GetName], had granted you the keys to Orthanc; and from that year of 2759 T.A. you have dwelt in Isengard.\n\nYou became a lord of Men; for at first you held Isengard as a lieutenant of the Steward and warden of the tower. Fréaláf was as glad as Beren to have this so, and knew that Isengard was in the hands of a strong friend. A friend you long were, and you kept the tower as part of the defences of the West, so long as you yourself remained the chief person in that defence, and the head of its council.\n\nYour subjects are of the Rohirrim and Dunlending, and no longer do you consider the [denethor.GetPrimaryTitle.GetName] as your liege."

 rohan.2200.t:0 "Ominous Reports" 
 rohan.2200.desc:0 "Riders from the Westfold have arrived with grim tidings. Orcs are freely roaming the countryside, pillaging villages and murdering wantonly. Yet these orcs seem far too organised to have come out of the mountains, and they bear a strange mark — a White Hand on a field of black. At this late hour, what new foe do we face? The White Wizard has grown reclusive of late, and my heart forebodes the long silence of Isengard has not been contemplation, but preparation." 
 rohan.2200.a:0 "Summon the riders. I will investigate these rumours myself." 
 rohan.2200.a.tt:0 "Ride west with your men and put an end to the attacks."

 rohan.2201.t:0 "The Westfold Aflame" 
 rohan.2201.desc:0 "Riding hard through the night, we came at last to the town of Fowlmere. But we came far too late. Fire engulfs the fields and the homes, and smoke chokes the very air. We can scarce endure it, but we must. We find at last a surviving villager, who tells us the whole harrowing tale. Dunlending raiders and orcs bearing great wrought armour branded with the reported White Hand struck them in the morning. Through the chaos of the slaughter, he claims to have heard the name of Saruman mentioned by both the Orcs and the Dunlendings while he hid. What I feared is true. Saruman has betrayed us."

 rohan.2202.desc:0 "We clashed with the forces of Isengard at the Fords of Isen. They charged us with little regard for their own lives, pushing towards me as swiftly as riders. My men have availed themselves honourably, and we have dealt a furious blow to their force, but I fear the enemy succeeded in their objective. While most of my army has successfully withdrawn, my guard and I found that we were cut off by a final charge. My retainers lie dead, and I fear I am to follow soon..." 
 rohan.2202.a:0 "Oh forefathers of Rohan, tend to my wounds..."
 
 rohan.2203.t:0 "Ambush at the Isen"
 rohan.2203.desc:0 "Volley upon volley the arrows rain down upon us, striking shield and steed with terrible ferocity. One by one my captains are felled from their horses and finished off by crooked blades. I ride hard to the east only to be stopped by a wall of pikemen. They strike and stab at me. All goes dark.\n\nSome hours later - perhaps days - I see a blinding light and shadows dancing in the river, figures picking through the dead, searching for something or something. Suddenly I become weightless, picked up and placed atop what I presume to be a horse, and as we begin to move everything returns to darkness." 
 rohan.2203.a:0 "May Eru grant me strength!" 
 
 rohan.2204.t:0 "The Death of Théodred" 
 rohan.2204.desc:0 "I scarcely have any strength left. I faintly know I rest in a bed, but why? The battle, the blood and the steel ringing... it's all muffled now, dim as through a fog. I faintly know I need to do something, but what? I am so tired, I want nothing more than to rest... \n\nSilently, I slip away, the last thoughts of my mind dwelling upon my beloved king and father, and the plight of our kingdom." #Théodred Dies in his sleep
 rohan.2204.a:0 "Fight on Rohan..." 
 
 rohan.2205.t:0 "Burying a Child" 
 rohan.2205.desc:0 "I am numb, the shock still keeping me from the tears that I know in time shall flow. My niece Éowyn helps lead the stoid procession to the Barrowfield, my son borne with full honours as befits a prince of the Mark. After the proceedings are done, I dismiss the people, and slowly they go away, my niece and nephew last among them. \n\nAt last the tears begin to flow, a hand upon my face as I gaze upon the mound of my beloved son, so proud and strong, yet so kind and noble. The old linger and the young perish - what justice is this?" #Théoden buries Théodred.

 rohan.2206.t:0 "Muster the Rohirrim!" 
 rohan.2206.desc:0 "We must root out the weed which has taken root in Isengard. Rohan lies aggrieved, its sons and daughters dying in the mud for the perverted depravations of the White Wizard, who has betrayed the trust of both Meduseld and Minas Tirith! \n\nDispatch riders to the four corners of the Riddermark - the sons of Eorl will not take such an affront without a response. We have fought many wars, and won many - what great victories has the White Wizard to his name? Riders of Rohan, oaths you have taken - now fulfil them all, to Lord and Land!"

At last, I end with a final impassioned plea to my king and father, to summon Rohan's riders to root out the evil which has taken root unseen in Isengard. \n\nMy father is inscrutable for several minutes, and in his eyes, I can see one thousand thoughts, a hundred plans - such is the mind of Théoden King, who has fought many wars and made peace after.

The White Wizard has grown reclusive of late, and could this be his work? \n\nGrima counsels me to wait, send out emissaries and be cautious, for has Saruman not long been a faithful warden of the western border? Meanwhile my nephew Éomer is much more direct, saying that if he has not betrayed us utterly, he is worthless as a warden. How else could such a force have crossed our border but by his complicit consent?

By the time he has hurriedly made his way to the balcony, the Ents of Fangorn have already broken through the Ring of Isengard and are rampaging through his immense workshops. In mere moments his years of preparation, painstakingly hidden, have been undone by a force he had never thought to factor into his plans. \n\nHe is safe enough in the Orthanc, but what remains of his armies are quickly being smashed beneath the terrible fury of the Onodrim. Just when it seems things cannot get any worse, the Ents break the great dam that had been erected upon the Isen. All at once, the reservoir of water comes rushing forth in a mighty wave, a small recreation of Akallabêth. And just as pride had brought low the Númenóreans, so too have all the works of Saruman's cunning mind of steel now been unmade by the fury of nature. \n\nHe is now a prisoner within what once was his seat of power."

From deep within the forest of Fangorn the ancient Onodrim, known to Men as the Ents, marched to war against Isengard, seeking vengeance against the power-hungry Saruman. \n\nIn a brutally decisive battle, the Ring of Isengard has been torn down, and its pits have been flooded by the Isen, flooding the valley when the Ents broke the great damn Saruman had built there. Saruman is now a prisoner within his own tower, the Ents having hunted down every last Uruk-hai in the region. \n\nThe Children of Yavanna have dealt a decisive blow against the darkness this day."

He shall relinquish the keys of Orthanc to him, having betrayed the trust given him as its warden and keeper, and then shall Théoden judge him for his crimes by the laws of Men. \n\nShould he refuse, Saruman will lose all right to trial and his fate will be sealed absolutely."

He implores Gríma, asking that he remember that he served him loyally for many years, and that he was once a man of honour and integrity before the lies of Saruman poisoned him. For a moment Gríma wavers, and it seems he will accept — but then you laugh, cold and fell, full of deep malice. \n\nFree? He shall never be free!\n\nGríma's face twists into terrible, burning hate, before he seems to steel himself. Beginning to speak again, you suddenly give out a hushed gasp as the air rushes out of you in shock. Gríma has stabbed you, and the force of the blow forces you over the edge, sending you plummeting towards the bottom of Orthanc. \n\nSo passes the would-be ruler of the world, Saruman the White, so proud and vain, undone by a beaten dog."

But now securely entrenched, there seems little reason to continue the charade. You have long desired to not merely equal Sauron, but to even surpass him — you too are a Ringmaker, and a master of the deep lore. \n\nSauron is a cudgel, forcing the world into his vision by brute might. You are a more subtle, less destructive master — your rule would bring prosperity and peace, under your wise leadership. \n\nBut Sauron is mighty — much of the East and the South is under his sway. Dare you risk it?"
