It seems that the growing peril has stirred something in him, and my own redemption has reminded him that there is still hope for the West. \n\nAnd in Rivendell there still remains considerable strength. Many of the remaining Noldor of Middle Earth reside there, among them warriors who fought from the first sunrise to the drowning of Beleriand.
