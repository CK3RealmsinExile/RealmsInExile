With Sauron in ascendancy, it seems that the Children of Ilúvatar need the ancient wisdom of the Istari now more than ever.\n\nAlas, our order is now disparate and disjointed. Gandalf holds the company of few, Radagast is a recluse and I have not heard from my azure kindred for many moons.\n\nThe time has come to establish a center of learning, here at Isengard. There is strength in numbers. I shall gather great minds and thinkers to Orthanc and form an Academy, to better prepare future generations to continue the fight against darkness."
