Nor would I in his place. And so my mortal form will be slain. And will the Valar receive my spirit home, after what I have done? Or is this my final ending?"

Fool! Were I in his place he would be staked out in a pit. He seems to think it will be a greater punishment to strip me of power and dignity, and exile me into the wilderness, thinking me now toothless and incapable of harm. We shall see!"

Just when it seems things cannot get any worse, the Ents break the great dam that had been erected upon the Isen.\n\nAll at once, the reservoir of water comes rushing forth in a mighty wave, an echo of [akallabeth|E]. And just as pride had brought low the [numenoreans|E], so too have all the works of my cunning mind been unmade by the fury of nature.\n\nI am now a prisoner within what once was my seat of power."

I brought gifts, and sang great praise of the valour of the [rohirrim|E], quickly earning the love of new King.\n\nSeeking greater security against Dunlending raids, the King convinced [beren.GetName] to grant me the keys to the abandoned tower of Orthanc, to act as a Warden over the western borderlands and a representative of the Steward."

 isengard.0102.desc:0 "Since taking residence in [isengard|E], I have uncovered many of its secrets, the greatest prize of all being the Orthanc-stone, one of the seven [palantir|E] of [numenor|E]. This ancient seeing stone has been invaluable in my hunt for the [onering|E] that I so desire, and I have learned much of the world as it was, as it is, and as it could be.\n\nLong have I sought the One Ring, for only with its power could any hope to compete with the [sauron.GetTitledFirstName], and only I have the wit and power to wield it. And yet, while I have managed to keep this hidden from the White Council, my activity has not gone unnoticed by the Eye in the East.\n\nSince retrieving another stone from [minasithil|E], Sauron disrupts any attempt to use the Palantír, his very essence filling my mind with an insatiable lust for power.\n\nThe Palantir remains my best chance to find the One, yet I doubt I can evade Sauron's notice for much longer."
 isengard.0102.a:0 "I must find the One Ring and bring order to Middle-earth!"

I search further and am directed over [mirkwood|E] to the [seaofrhun|E], where I observe the people of those lands, but someone else is watching.\n\n#V He has found me.#! I perceive the form of a great eye, lidless and wreathed in flame. Within his fortress of Barad-dûr [sauronthedarklordcharacter|E] sees me, his reaching flames pierce through the [palantirone|E] and grasp me, seeking to infiltrate my mind and learn my designs.\n\nAs the stone shows me Sauron's utter conquest of the East and the South, I realise that he does not yet know of my search for the One Ring. I must deceive him by feigning allegiance, or match his will and fight for control of the Palantír."
 isengard.0103.a:0 "Saruman pledges allegiance to you, Lord Sauron..."

Yet the One Ring has evaded me, and my own stumbling essays in ringcraft have been a lesson in humility.\n\nOut of envy and pride I kept hidden much that should have been shared with the Wise, and thwarted the White Council at every turn lest it undermine my own preeminence. Only now do I see my folly. By stalling and forestalling I have allowed Sauron to gather such strength that it may overwhelm us all. \n\nYet it may not be too late.

Its membership drawn from the greatest of those elves remaining in Middle Earth, along with the wisest of the Istari. \n\nI was appointed as its chief after the Grey Pilgrim declined the offer of leadership, and in my folly I resented that I was not the first chosen. And in my arrogance I oft prevented the Council from taking action, fearing that my own ambitions would be thwarted. \n\nBut now I see my folly. The peril from the East is now great, and I must summon those with whom I can still claim friendship to oppose it, lest all of us fall separately. The Council must be reformed!"

Persuading her of my good intentions, and my sincere repentance for past failings, was not easy. \n\nYet she has powers beyond the greatest of her fellow elves left in Middle Earth, and with her gifts stared into my very soul. Much that she found there disquieted her, but in the end she knew I was not false, and that without my aid all Middle Earth would fall to a second darkness. \n\nAfter long deliberation she granted me a boon more powerful than I could have hoped for - a formal alliance between Lothlórien and Isengard. Perhaps, with our wisdom and forces combined, we might muster sufficient strength to oppose the Enemy, and rally hope in the hearts of men and elf alike."

But the time for such rivalries has passed. We stand on the precipice, and only together will we have hope of guiding those who still oppose Sauron.\n\nI have opened my heart to the Grey Pilgrim, and shown him that I am capable of redemption and even humility. I even confessed that I thought him nearly as wise as me! Though it took all of my powers of persuasion, he has finally agreed to join my court at Orthanc. With our powers and knowledge combined perhaps Isengard can become a beacon and bastion of the West, standing in defiance of Mordor and its bestial hordes."

In him are united the lines of many great kings and heroes, yet he has long contented himself with only Imladris, a place of peace and quiet, memories and scrolls. So much more was his to claim by birthright, yet he settled for simple titles and a humble realm, ever the right hand of others, unwilling to dream of greater things. \n\nYet our talk at the Council was most fruitful. It seems that the growing peril has stirred something in him, and my own redemption has reminded him that there is still hope for the West. \n\nAnd in Rivendell there still remains considerable strength. Many of the remaining Noldor of Middle Earth reside there, among them warriors who fought from the first sunrise to the drowning of Beleriand. And now Elrond pledges a cohort of these warriors to me, to use in my quest against The Enemy! Let us hope that they will bring us victory..."

In retrospect, though, I realise that Gandalf needed it more than me, not being bestowed with such great inherent power.\n\nNow he has shown good judgement again. In Lindon remain many of the Sindar of Beleriand, looking to their own affairs and ignoring most of what occurs beyond the Blue Mountains. \n\nYet Cirdan recognises the peril of the hour, and arising from his long slumber has agreed to commit a force of his finest warriors to the struggle against Mordor. These have wisely been placed under my command. Let us hope that their bows will make short work of the Orcish hordes..."
