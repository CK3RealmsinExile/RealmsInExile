 ### ANTISARUMAN EVENTS ###
 saruman.0400.t: "A Friend's Advice"
 saruman.0400.desc: "During a meeting with my council, I noticed [antisaruman.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] seemed to be in a foul mood, in contemplation of an issue unrelated to that of the council's. After the meeting ended, [antisaruman.GetSheHe] approached me when we were both left alone and, in a hushed tone, started to speak to me: "[ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip], there's a matter we've to discuss; it's in regard to the White Wizard's offer of power.".  [antisaruman.GetSheHe] pauses, then looks at your eyes, "The Wizard has demanded and taken from you more than your allegiance only; I'm afraid he's taken hold of you, my [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip].".\n\n[antisaruman.GetSheHe] continues talking about you and the Wizard Saruman, but you've already guessed where this conversation will end up..."
 saruman.0400.a: "You challenge my every decision as if you seek to rule [ROOT.Char.GetPrimaryTitle.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] yourself."
 saruman.0400.b: "Your lust for my power has turned you, [antisaruman.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip], into a foe."
 saruman.0400.c: "In time we hate that which we often fear, and you, my friend, fear me."
 saruman.0401.t: "Your Own Thoughts"
 saruman.0401.desc: ""But my [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip]..." As [antisaruman.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] goes on talking, a flurry of thoughts invade your mind, thoughts of greed, ambition, and betrayal. When [antisaruman.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip]'s speech nears its end, you feel a headache so powerful that you can barely make out the last words [antisaruman.GetSheHe] said.\n\nYou realize that you have to make a decision: is this [antisaruman.GetTitledFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip]'s doing, or that of Saruman?"
 saruman.0401.a: "This has got to be Saruman's doing!"
 saruman.0401.b: "It's [antisaruman.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], [antisaruman.GetSheHe] wants me dead!"
 saruman.0402.t: "Breathe the Free Air"
 saruman.0402.desc: "You feel as if a weight was suddenly lifted up from your shoulders, a weight you hadn't noticed before. Your mind is at ease now, with all ill thoughts now being washed away with a newfound serenity.\n\n[antisaruman.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] stands before you smiling with watering eyes. "Breathe the free air again, my friend.""
 saruman.0402.a: "I, I remember your face; [antisaruman.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]."
