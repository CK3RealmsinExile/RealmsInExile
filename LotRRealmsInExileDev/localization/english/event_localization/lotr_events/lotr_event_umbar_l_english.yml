 umbar.0102.t: "The Ar-Adûnâim Return to Umbar"
 umbar.0102.desc.a: "I stride off the ship, my brow held high. The wharfs are damaged from battle, both recent and old, but are still usable. Behind me, a loyal retinue of my best soldiers form an honor guard. \n\nI stalk up to the mansions at the top of the city, the seat of the fools who had once banished us from our city, the city of Ar-Pharazôn our forefather, of our people! The local people quail as I stride towards it. They shall have their turn for judgement. \n\nAt last arriving at the mansions which form the heart of the government of [umbar|E], I have brought before me all the local elites who did not manage to flee. I decree those of [numenorean|E] descent are to be spared, provided they swear fealty to the true king of the [adunai|E]. Those who are not... well. They should not have desecrated this city with their presence."
 umbar.0102.desc.b: "In a shocking reversal, the once-exiled blood-purists of the [GetTitleByKey('e_adunaim').GetNameNoTier]  have seized the havens of [GetTitleByKey('c_umbar').GetNameNoTier] . Thought to have been exiled to their deaths on a barren archipelago far off the coast of [umbar|E], somehow, they have managed to amass a force sufficient to take it by storm. \n\n[adunaim_conquerer.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], master of the Ar-Adûnâim, has decreed all those unable to prove a high degree of [numenorean|E] descent are to be exiled from the haven proper, and has already set to purging what remains of the city's old administration. \n\nWhat will happen next remains to be seen."

The Corsair-Lords mutter still about the unfortunate fire in the great haven itself, fuming ever more loudly about our continued freedom on these barren islands. While it has been our goal to build a city here, a new [Concept('armenelos','Arminalêth')|E] in [middleearth|E], there are many more places in this world where the [numenorean_empire|E] once held sway - and many of these have fallen into disrepair.\n\n One such stronghold, the great city of [GetTitleByKey('c_tharbad').GetNameNoTier], screams out for strong hand. A [numenorean|E] hand. \n\nShall we leave these islands and the judgement of lesser [men|E] behind us and brave the wrath of the sea to claim dominion over the ruins of a new land? Shall we bring the might of the [adunai|E] once more to the desolate wilderness of [eriador|E], its iron rule to what backwards peasants we find there?"

As the sun rises the fleet of the [GetTitleByKey('e_adunaim').GetNameNoTier] raise their sails, offering prayers to [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] for calm seas and swift winds as our former home dwindles behind the horizon, leaving nothing in any direction but sea."
 umbar.0104.a: "May [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] send us favourable winds!"
 
 umbar.0105.t: "Life at Sea"
 umbar.0105.desc: "Many days have passed since we sailed from [GetTitleByKey('c_tol_uialgaer').GetNameNoTier], many days filled with nought but the sight and smell of the sea. By our estimation, we have yet some days to travel ere we reach our goal, the mouth of the Gwathló river, when the winds that had brought us this far died down.\n\n The monotony of our voyage grows unbearable in the days that followed, making no discernible progress under power of our oars or the sails. Yet even this dull state seems like a blessing when we spy a great gathering storm clouds in the distance, blocking the path to our expedition's destination..\n\nDo we brave the storm or sail around it at the risk of getting lost?"

 umbar.0106.desc: "Alas! Our prayers have proved fruitless as the storm only grows stronger and closer, crashing at last into our fleet. The waves churn our vessels, the sheeting rain blinding us to all beyond the bows of our ships. And yet the storm rages ever on. For what seems like an eternity we are battered with wind and waves, separated from the rest of the fleet.\n\n Waves washing over the decks sweep many sailors caught unawares to a watery grave before at last the clouds part, the seas calm and the wind finally relents, calming the seas with no more than a gentle breeze tugging at our sails. Limping forth from the storm, we set to repairing our ship and waiting to see if any other vessels have survived the onslaught of the sea."

 umbar.0107.t: "Tulmultuous Waves"
 umbar.0107.desc: "Over the course of a day many more of our ships emerged from the storm, making towards us with what haste they could muster. Though badly damaged, our armada remained mostly intact, with those losses we suffered keenly felt yet acceptable for those who survived the fury of Zôranazâr.\n\nAs we set out once more, the sea remains calm, but it would be wise to make haste towards our destination, lest the storm returns..."

 umbar.0108.t: "Ruinous Waves"
 umbar.0108.desc: "The storm rages out at sea while we repair our ship and slowly some more of our ships emerge from the tumult, all sitting low in the water limping slowly to shore. Our losses were great - our once mighty armada has been reduced to a bare half of its original strength. And yet, we've survived. Battered and bruised, yes, but we survived all that Zôranazâr could throw at us.\n\nWithout further delay, we shall get to work. When our fleet is repaired and all hope of further survivors has vanished, we shall set sail once more."
 umbar.0108.a: "To Tharbad!"

 umbar.0109.t: "The Wrath of Ulmo"
 umbar.0109.desc: "Our vessel shattered by the wrath of the storm, we take many days to make the repairs necessary to sail again. The crew is under no illusion that they too would have met their end to the wrath of Zôranazâr, had not the Witch-Princess Arphazêl resorted to her dark magic, calming the seas enough for the ship to escape.\n\n The fate of the rest of the royal family none know, yet there is no doubt that they rest now in the embrace of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]. No other ships were sighted emerging from the storm ere it dissipated, the might of the [adunai|E] now all but spent, but our spirit endures. Our ambition endures."

 umbar.0110.desc: "At long last, months after setting out from Anagzâyân, the survivors of the great storm have arrived. We saw first the coast of [eriador|E] and the mouth of the river Gwathló. At [GetTitleByKey('c:tharbad').GetNameNoTier], we came to the Great Bridge, ruined by the passage of time, and set ashore in the midst of the ancient port.

Finally, we of the Ar-Adûnâim can return to our rightful seat of power, and begin to steer the fate of Umbar as we see fit. \n\nWith the aid of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName], we have overcome the defenses of the great harbour and swept away any opposition, proving once and for all that our ways are superior, and our claim is ever true. \n\nNow, we have much to do..."

We have been blown far off course - but #italic how#! far exactly?\n\nBefore us lies a barren coast, betraying no signs of life. Behind us, in deeper waters, the storm still rages unabated. Those who survived the tempest now turn their eyes towards me, asking me what should be done next.\n\nShould we dare to venture back out into the raging waters? Can we afford to brave the storm once more? Or do we make landfall here, and see what is to be done in this land of unforseen opportunity?"

 umbar.0113.desc: "We have left the ships behind, dismantling them to use the materials for construction of our new holding. Scouts have gone into the surrounding wilderness, making sure it is free of threats. \n\nWe now know we have been cast away to the distant shores of [cast_away_county.GetNameNoTier], a far cry from the mysterious ruins of [GetTitleByKey('c_tharbad').GetNameNoTier] that we set out to reach.\n\nMost of us are glad to be alive, but I cannot easily leave behind my anger at our misfortune. It is time that we turned our fate around, forging a new realm from these shores we have been brought to!"

 umbar.0114.desc: "At long last, months after setting out from Anagzâyân, the survivors of the great storm have arrived. Not much of the ancient haven of [numenor|E] had survived upon the isle of [GetTitleByKey('c_ardinak').GetNameNoTier], but we were able to make do with what materials we brought with us and with what we could salvage from the ruins here.\n\nAs I stand upon the ramparts of my new residence, I spy coastal jungles and beyond, the majestic [yellowmountains|E] across the Bay of Usakan. These wide, empty lands are ripe for the taking - in the name of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]!"
 umbar.0114.a: "A new beginning for our people..."
 
 umbar.0115.t: "The Curse of Ardinâk"
 umbar.0115.desc: "Ever since our arrival upon the isle of [GetTitleByKey('c_ardinak').GetNameNoTier], settlers have periodically gone missing. Some are never found again, while others turn up as shriveled husks, as if something had drained them of all their life all at once. The populace is terrified, and even my own familiy has begun to no longer feel safe within our own walls...\n\nThe men of [GetTitleByKey('k_tanturak').GetNameNoTier] speak of an ancient plague that once depopulated Ardinâk, which had been a mighty haven of [numenor|E] before. Surely the effects of that disaster must have long passed? It has been millennia since then, hasn't it?\n\nDoubt begins to rise within me..."

That name does carry a certain weight, even now.\n\nIf I willed it, I could decide to sunder myself even further from my family, branching off into a house of my own.

It doesn't take long for him to spit out the traitor's name; it is one of my own blood!\n\nThe young sorceress [arphazel.GetFirstName] has seen fit to set aflame one of the storages rooms to mask her flight from the palace. How dare she?\n\nEver since her talent for the dark arts were discovered, we have sheltered her; kept her safe behind the walls of my own stronghold. And this is how she repays me?

Finally, I am master of my own fate.\n\nEver since I was born, I was kept under close watch by those who call themselves my family - my cruel father and brothers, and that lecherous priest, Varkan. Not once was I permitted to leave the confines of [GetTitleByKey('c_tol_uialgaer').GetNameNoTier], doomed to a pitiful existence within a gilded cage, rotting away with my mother and my sweet sisters; the only close kin that I will miss. But they taught me how to weild their dark arts - for which I showed great talent. And those powers have now burned away my chains and opened my path to freedom.\n\nI turn away from the ocean and look towards the small camp I have set up.

And yet...\n\nPart of me wishes to go back once I've gathered enough strength, and tear down any semblance of power that my father [daddy.GetFirstName] still bears. To see him humbled before me as I take his place on the throne would work wonders to heal some of the wounds I've suffered on that blasted island.\n\n[GetTitleByKey('c_ramlond').GetNameNoTier] is a city of many opportunities.

 umbar.0169.desc: "A short while after stepping off the ferry that brought me to the isle of [GetTitleByKey('d_tolfalas').GetNameNoTier], I am approached by a man in a grey cloak, spear in hand. "You must be [ROOT.Char.GetFirstName]," he greets me with approval in his voice. "I've heard much about you. You're as impressive in person as the tales make you out to be."\n\nI'm not quite sure how to react to that, so I simply ask for his name and the reason for our meeting here. "Where are my manners?" he says, smiling apologetically. "I am [galador.GetFirstName], a wanderer from afar. And I present you with an opportunity. Your sister, [bigsis.GetFirstName] is dear to you, no? She is here, on a corsair ship docked in a cove nearby. If you are willing, I will lead you there so we may try and rescue her.""
 umbar.0169.a: "Very well. Lead the way, Galador."
 umbar.0169.a.tt: "#help You will attempt to rescue [bigsis.GetFirstName]#!"

 umbar.0169.b.tt: "#help You decide against rescueing [bigsis.GetFirstName]#!"
 
 umbar.0170.t: "The Corsair Cove"
 umbar.0170.desc: "After nightfall, [galador.GetFirstName] and I approach the hidden cove where the black-sailed corsair ship is moored. Leaving my doubts behind, I edge closer to the stranger as he peers around a large rock to watch for enemy lookouts.\n\n"There are two ways to go about this," he says. "We either rely on secrecy or surprise. Which shall it be, [ROOT.Char.GetFirstName]?"\n\nHe grips his spear, awaiting my response."
 umbar.0170.a: "We surprise them. Come, now is the time!"
 umbar.0170.a.success: "You manage to overwhelm the Corsairs"
 umbar.0170.a.failure: "The Corsairs repel your attack"
 umbar.0170.b: "We rely on stealth. Let us sneak aboard!"
 umbar.0170.b.success: "You manage to sneak past the watchmen"
 umbar.0170.b.failure: "You are spotted and driven off"
 umbar.0170.c: "These Corsairs can be bribed. Let me handle the talking."
 
 umbar.0171.t: "Ranger of the North"
 umbar.0171.desc: "We regroup near the docks as the sun rises in the east. As [galador.GetFirstName] begins to say his goodbyes, I stop him and ask where he comes from. After a few attempts of evading the question, he finally gives in.\n\n"You are persistent, I'll give you that," he says with a smile. "Very well then. I am Galador of House Artenosse, one of the [dunedainnorth|E]. As for my reasons of coming so far south... I shan't reveal them, at least not just yet."\n\n#italic All right, keep your secrets#!, I think to myself as he finally turns to leave."
 umbar.0171.a: "I hope to see you again soon, [galador.GetFirstName]..."
 umbar.0171.b: "I thank you for your assistance, friend."
 umbar.0171.c: "Farewell, [galador.GetFirstName]."
 umbar.0171.d: "I don't trust you or your people."
 
 umbar.0173.t: "A Hopeful Coast"
 umbar.0173.desc: "I step off the ship, careful to not lose my footing on the uneven ground before me. No quays have yet been built here - only the foundations of a few initial buildings have been laid so far. But that will change, in time.\n\nThe settlement is full of refugees, seeking to escape the looming threat on [gondor|E]'s eastern borders, where the Shadows of [mordor|E] are rising. Many now flock to the quiet lands of Gondor's westernmost provinces, hoping to build a new existance here - far away from the terrors of war.\n\nI instruct my entourage to set up our camp near to the settlement and begin to make plans on how best to aid the new haven's construction..."
 umbar.0173.a: "Let's send out foraging parties to supply the workers."
 umbar.0173.b: "I'll assign my followers to aid the construction directly."

 umbar.0174.desc: "Some time after arriving in [GetTitleByKey('c_an_cosa_bras').GetNameNoTier] I am surprised to see [princess.GetFirstName] suddenly appearing before me. "Lady [ROOT.Char.GetFirstName]!" she greets me enthusiastically, "I heard you accepted the contract to aid the settlers here and came to see how the work was progressing!"\n\nIt is quite obvious to me that [princess.GetFirstName] truly came to see #italic me#! instead of the workers. Still, I feel like there's no harm in her being here.\n\n"Would you like to show me around?" [princess.GetFirstName] asks. "I'd be happy to spend some time with you while I'm here!""
 umbar.0174.a: "Very well, [princess.GetFirstName], come along then."
 umbar.0174.b: "Why don't you stay here a while longer, dear [princess.GetFirstName]?"
 umbar.0174.c: "Can't you see I have important work to do here?"
 
 umbar.0175.t: "Gondor's Newest Haven"
 umbar.0175.desc: "It is done! The work has been finished, and the seaside town of [GetTitleByKey('b_zodima').GetNameNoTier] has now become the westernmost of [gondor|E]'s havens. A road is being built to connect the town with the rest of the realm and every day a few new settlers arrive.\n\nWith my contract complete, I approach [serelondholder.GetName] in order to collect my payment. While handing me my reward, he surprises me by offering me ownership of [GetTitleByKey('c_an_cosa_bras').GetNameNoTier]  and her surrounding lands, requiring nothing but an oath of fealty to [lordofgondor.GetName]! This is a most unexpected offer. Accepting it would mean the end of my travels, at least for now..."
 umbar.0175.a: "I accept with pleasure."
 umbar.0175.b: "I'm sorry, but I must refuse."

 umbar.0176.desc: "I have been careful. So very careful, ever since I escaped from [GetTitleByKey('c_tol_uialgaer').GetNameNoTier]. But it seems I haven't been careful #italic enough#!. As I pass through an alley in [GetTitleByKey('c_mirlond').GetNameNoTier], it only takes a second. A tiny distraction. A knife is pressed against my throat, and my hands are bound behind my back.\n\nBefore I have time to process my capture, my assailant suddenly lets go of me. I feel his weight against my back as he slumps forward, blood pooling beneath his lifeless body. "It seems I came just in time," a familiar voice says. I turn around and recognise [agandur.GetName], one of my father's knights. Why did he save me?"\n\n"I know you do not trust me, Arphazêl," he says. "But I wish to earn that trust. I've saved your life, and I'm willing to do it again. I've left your father's service to keep you safe."\n\nI must consider carefully if this man can be of help to me..."
 umbar.0176.a: "Very well. Come quickly, before the guards are here."

 umbar.0177.desc: "It has been some time since I last saw [galador.GetFirstName], who claims to be a Ranger of the North. But now he's appeared before me once again, bearing a smile that can be interpreted in many different ways. He correctly guesses that I'm still a bit wary of him.\n\n"Have I done something to displease you, [root.CHAR.GetFirstName]? I merely wished to see how you were faring, and... to offer my help in the months to come." "And why is that?" I ask, crossing my arms.\n\n"It is in my nature to aid those who deserve it," he replies cryptically. "Don't worry. All your questions shall be answered, in due time. Until then, will you have me?""
 umbar.0177.a: "Very well. I could use a friendly face around here."
 umbar.0177.b: "The truth is... I #italic have#! missed you..."

 ### Umbar Events ###
 umbar.1000.t: "The Castamiri Claim"
 umbar.1000.desc: "Since the days of the [kinstrife|E], Castamir's descendants have been forced to cower in [umbar|E], denied their rightful birthright by bitter nobles and jealous Stewards. No longer! We shall have our birthright."
 umbar.1000.a: "Our day has come! We sail for Gondor!"
 umbar.1000.a.tt: "Glory or defeat, it shall be decided today."
 
 umbar.1001.t: "The Reigns of Castamir"
 umbar.1001.desc: "After a long and brutal campaign, [gondor|E] at last kneels before her rightful king once more. The Stewards have been stripped of their office, and the lords brought to heel. Once more, for the first time since the [kinstrife|E], the line of Castamir rules fair Gondor. But the time has come to make a choice. In our years in exile, we came to name ourselves lord of [umbar|E]. A prestigious name, but not the one we have so long staked a claim to. Shall we reclaim the title of King of Gondor, or shall we remain the King of Umbar?"
 umbar.1001.a: "Gondor has always been our true home."
 umbar.1001.b: "Gondor shall become part of something greater."
 
 umbar.1002.t: "An Invasion from the South!"
 umbar.1002.desc: "Reports have come of a great fleet off the coasts of Harondor. The lord of [umbar|E], an alleged descendant of the accursed Castamir the Usurper, has declared his intent to retake his ancestral throne, by force if necessary. The coastal lords are already rallying their forces, and the Sealord of Pelargir has ordered the fleet massed there. \n\nWhatever right Castamir and his kin ever had to the throne of [gondor|E] was rendered null and void in the [kinstrife|E] by right of his tyranny and treason against the rightful king. We cannot allow his descendants to claim something unrightfully theirs!"
 umbar.1002.a: "We shall cast this foul usurper back into the Sea, and Gondor will not forget this..."
 
 umbar.0001.t: "Unrest in Western Gondor"
 umbar.0001.desc: "My lord, there is news of great unrest in the western frontier of [gondor|E]. Perhaps this is an opportunity? These Wildmen factions are more than eager to raid and harass Gondor's western borders. If we were to fund one of these groups, they could prove valuable to our future places of reclamation."
 umbar.0001.a: "We shall fund these Wildmen."
 umbar.0001.tt: "A decision to fund a Wildmen invasion of Gondor is available while you have the Black Lord of Umbar modifier."
 umbar.0001.b: "We don't require the aid of savages to take back what is ours!"

 umbar.0002.t: "Unrest in Western Gondor"
 umbar.0002.desc: "The Wildmen have accepted our offer and an invasion into [gondor|E] has been launched! We shall have to make certain to watch any further developments closely..."
 umbar.0002.a: "Good, Gondor's loss is our gain."

 umbar.0003.t: "Unrest in Western Gondor"
 umbar.0003.desc: "The Wildmen have declined our offer; no invasion shall be launched. Thankfully, the brutes were honourable enough to return the funds we had given them."
 umbar.0003.a: "A pity, they seemed capable enough."

 umbar.0004.t: "Unrest in Western Gondor"
 umbar.0004.desc: "The Wildmen have declined our offer; no invasion will be launched. To add insult to injury, the scoundrels have seemingly decided to keep our funds for themselves!"
 umbar.0004.a: "How dare they!"
 
 umbar.1003.t: "A New Capital?"
 umbar.1003.desc: "Now that the realm of Gondor has finally been unified under its rightful King, the question remains, from where shall we rule our great Kingdom. Some voices are calling for us to take the old seat of [gondor|E] and rule the Kingdom from there. Meanwhile others want us to retain our ancient seat of [umbar|E]. Finally, some remember the reign of King Castamir I of Gondor and want us to make [GetTitleByKey('c_pelargir').GetNameNoTier] our capital due to its historical importance and strategic positioning in between the two halves of our realm."
 umbar.1003.a: "Minas Tirith shall be our capital."
 umbar.1003.b: "Restored Osgiliath shall be our seat."
 umbar.1003.c: "We shall honour Castamir and make Pelargir the capital."
 umbar.1003.d: "Umbar is and shall remain the core of our Kingdom."
 
 umbar.0201.t: "To Kill a King"
 umbar.0201.desc: "Kathuphazgân, my beloved husband's father, is a roadblock to my ambitions. Though I have both Câssimir and Burôdapân under my sway, so long as Kathuphazgân still lives, my influence shall be only marginal. \n\nAnd that is assuming that he does not move against me in some form. No. Kathuphazgân shall need to be... disposed of. He is old, and gout-ridden - surely it will come to the surprise of none when at he meets his tragic demise..."
 umbar.0201.a: "To kill a king is no small matter."
 umbar.0201.a.tt: "Kathuphazgân shall breathe his last."
 
 umbar.0202.t: "Eyes in the Darkness"
 umbar.0202.desc: "The hour is late, and the pain of my gout flares. With an aching groan, I get up from my bed, struggling to make it to my medicine. It had come at high price, imported from distant lands far to the south. \n\nSuddenly, I hear noises behind me. I whirl around but see nothing. Unnoticed by me, slithe forms slide through the shadows of the room, taking up positions, as if to strike. Gathering my composure once more, I turn to my medicine once again. \n\nAnd gazing into my eyes, are two slits, set in yellow, in a form black as night. I begin to rear back in surprise, when I suddenly feel weights fall upon me on all sides. \n\nI stumble, trying to throw them off me, but then one gets under my leg! Flailing, I fall forward, and my head slams down hard upon the desk's edge. My mind goes blank, and I slide to the floor..."
 umbar.0202.a: "There is nothing. Nothing but the endless sleep."
 
 umbar.0203.t: "To Kill a King"
 umbar.0203.desc: "Success! Kathuphazgân has passed after an unfortunate fall in the night. His personal physician, looking him over, believes that after experiencing a gout attack, he tried to retrieve his medicine, but fell and smashed his head into the edge of his desk! Not a trace of my involvement. \n\nCâssimir and Burôdapân both are bereaved, for while they have little patience for each other, they both loved their father. They shall need comfort in their time of grief - and afterwards, a new [umbar|E] will rise. One with a brother in the city, and another leading the fleets... and the queen, who rules both from the shadows."
 umbar.0203.a: "After all... every king needs his queen, right?"

 umbar.1600.t: "The Call of the Seas"
 umbar.1600.desc: "I stand at the shore watching my men readying my fleets for plunder. The newer ships in the fleet feature broader holds and bigger sails than the older - More stores for gold, goods and slaves.\n\nI have chosen the life of a corsair, as I cannot resist the temptation of sweet plunder." #juke note: make better
 umbar.1600.a: "It's a corsair's life for me."

 umbar.1601.t: "A United Harnen"
 umbar.1601.desc: "The consolidation of [GetTitleByKey('d_ramlond').GetNameNoTier] and [GetTitleByKey('d_forethir').GetNameNoTier] not only bolsters our military might but also sweetens our financial situation. After generations of rivalry and strife between the two havens, the uniting of the two has brought much needed prosperity to the area.\n\nWith full control over the mouth of the Harnen, we control and regulate a massive portion of all trade entering [harad|E]. Due to this, the region has already received fruitful returns.\n\nWhereas once the region was marked by a tug-of-war over trade rights, now the havens march towards a richer future!"
 umbar.1601.a: "Let the Havens put aside their differences!"
 
 umbar.2000.t: "The Sacred Isles Renewed"
 umbar.2000.desc: "Black sails fill the havens on each of the four Sacred Isles as my armada gathers in triupmh. All four harbours are mine, finally united under a single ruler.\n\nLet it be known that these islands shall never again be taken from the Corsairs, and let the Kingdom of the Sacred Isles stand defiant until the end of all days!"
 umbar.2000.a: "The tides shall guide me."
 umbar.2000.b: "Onwards, to plunder and glory!"
