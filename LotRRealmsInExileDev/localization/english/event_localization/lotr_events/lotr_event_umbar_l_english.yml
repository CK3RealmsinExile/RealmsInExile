Behind me, a loyal retinue of my best soldiers form an honor guard. \n\nI stalk up to the mansions at the top of the city, the seat of the fools who had once banished us from our city, the city of Ar-Pharazôn our forefather, of our people! The local people quail as I stride towards it. They shall have their turn for judgement. \n\nAt last arriving at the mansions which form the heart of the government of [umbar|E], I have brought before me all the local elites who did not manage to flee.

While it has been our goal to build a city here, a new [Concept('armenelos','Arminalêth')|E] in [middleearth|E], there are many more places in this world where the [numenorean_empire|E] once held sway - and many of these have fallen into disrepair.\n\n One such stronghold, the great city of [GetTitleByKey('c_tharbad').GetNameNoTier] , screams out for strong hand. A [numenorean|E] hand. \n\nShall we leave these islands and the judgement of lesser [men|E] behind us and brave the wrath of the sea to claim dominion over the ruins of a new land? Shall we bring the might of the [adunai|E] once more to the desolate wilderness of [eriador|E], its iron rule to what backwards peasants we find there?"

Not a trace of my involvement. \n\nCâssimir and Burôdapân both are bereaved, for while they have little patience for each other, they both loved their father. They shall need comfort in their time of grief - and afterwards, a new [umbar|E] will rise. One with a brother in the city, and another leading the fleets... and the queen, who rules both from the shadows."

Due to this, the region has already recieved fruitful returns.\n\nWhereas once the region was marked by a tug-of-war over trade rights, now the havens march towards a richer future!"
