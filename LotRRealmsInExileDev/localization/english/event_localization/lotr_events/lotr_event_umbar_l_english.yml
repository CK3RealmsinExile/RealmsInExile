 umbar.0102.t:0 "The Ar-Adûnâim Return to Umbar"
 umbar.0102.desc.a:0 "I stride off the ship, my brow held high. The wharfs are damaged from battle, both recent and old, but are still usable. Behind me, a loyal retinue of my best soldiers form an honor guard. \n\nI stalk up to the mansions at the top of the city, the seat of the fools who had once banished us from our city, the city of Ar-Pharazôn our forefather, of our people! The local people quail as I stride towards it. They shall have their turn for judgement. \n\nAt last arriving at the mansions which form the heart of the government of [umbar|E], I have brought before me all the local elites who did not manage to flee. I decree those of [numenorean|E] descent are to be spared, provided they swear fealty to the true king of the [adunai|E]. Those who are not... well. They should not have desecrated this city with their presence."
 umbar.0102.desc.b:0 "In a shocking reversal, the once-exiled blood-purists of the [GetTitleByKey('e_adunaim').GetNameNoTier]  have seized the havens of [GetTitleByKey('c_umbar').GetNameNoTier] . Thought to have been exiled to their deaths on a barren archipelago far off the coast of [umbar|E], somehow, they have managed to amass a force sufficient to take it by storm. \n\n[adunaim_conquerer.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], master of the Ar-Adûnâim, has decreed all those unable to prove a high degree of [numenorean|E] descent are to be exiled from the haven proper, and has already set to purging what remains of the city's old administration. \n\nWhat will happen next remains to be seen."
 umbar.0102.a:0 "Let the havens be cleansed."
 umbar.0102.b:0 "Nothing good can come of this."
 
 umbar.0103.t:0 "Rumors of Lost Glory"
 umbar.0103.desc:0 "Since our exile from [umbar|E] at the hands of the so-called 'pragmatists' we of the [GetTitleByKey('e_adunaim').GetNameNoTier]  have heard many rumours from the mainland. The Corsair-Lords mutter still about the unfortunate fire in the great haven itself, fuming ever more loudly about our continued freedom on these barren islands. While it has been our goal to build a city here, a new [Concept('armenelos','Arminalêth')|E] in [middleearth|E], there are many more places in this world where the [numenorean_empire|E] once held sway - and many of these have fallen into disrepair. One such stronghold, the great city of [GetTitleByKey('c_tharbad').GetNameNoTier] , screams out for strong hand. A [numenorean|E] hand. \n\nShall we leave these islands and the judgement of lesser [men|E] behind us and brave the wrath of the sea to claim dominion over the ruins of a new land? Shall we bring the might of the [adunai|E] once more to the desolate wilderness of [eriador|E], its iron rule to what backwards peasants we find there?"
 umbar.0103.a:0 "Begin preparations at once"
 umbar.0103.b:0 "I will not resign myself to a ruin"
 
 umbar.0104.t:0 "Setting Sail to Tharbad"
 umbar.0104.desc:0 "All is made ready - the ships are set, the [adunai|E] eager for new lands free for the taking. As the sun rises the fleet of the [GetTitleByKey('e_adunaim').GetNameNoTier]  raise their sails, offering prayers to Mulkhêr for calm seas and swift winds as our former home dwindles behind the horizon, leaving nothing in any direction but sea."
 umbar.0104.a:0 "Mulkhêr, grant us a favourable wind!"
 
 umbar.0105.t:0 "Life at Sea"
 umbar.0105.desc:0 "Many days have passed since we sailed from [GetTitleByKey('c_ton_uialgaer').GetNameNoTier] , many days filled with nought but the sight and smell of the sea. By our estimation, we have yet some days to travel ere we reach our goal, the mouth of the Gwathló river, when the winds that had brought us this far died down. The monotony of our voyage grows unbearable in the days that followed, making no discernible progress under power of our oars or the sails. Yet even this dull state seemed like a blessing when we spied the gathering storm clouds in the distance, while we could do little but pray they passed us by."
 umbar.0105.a:0 "Mulkhêr, let the storm pass us by!"

 umbar.0106.t:0 "Stormy Waters"
 umbar.0106.desc:0 "Alas, our prayers proved fruitless as the storm only grew stronger and closer, crashing at last into our fleet. The waves churned our vessels, the sheeting rain blinding us to all beyond the bows of our ships. And yet the storm raged on. For what seemed like an eternity we were battered with wind and waves, separated from the rest of the fleet. Waves washing over the decks swept many sailors caught unawares to a watery grave before at last the clouds parted, the sea calmed and the wind relented, revealing to us our goal - the coast of Eriador, the mouth of the Gwathló. Limping forth from the storm, we set to repairing our ship and waiting to see if any other vessels had survived the onslaught of the sea."
 umbar.0106.a:0 "How many have survived?"
 
 umbar.0107.t:0 "Tulmultuous Waves"
 umbar.0107.desc:0 "Over the course of a day many more of our ships emerged from the storm, making towards us with what haste they could muster. Though badly damaged, our armada remained mostly intact, with those losses we suffered keenly felt yet acceptable for those who survived the fury of Zôranazâr."
 umbar.0107.a:0 "And so we continue"
 
 umbar.0108.t:0 "Ruinous Waves"
 umbar.0108.desc:0 "The storm rages out at sea while we repair our ship and slowly some more of our ships emerge from the tumult, all sitting low in the water limping slowly to shore. Our losses were great, our once mighty armaga reduced to a bare half of its original strength. And yet, we survived. Battered and bruised, yes, but we survived all that Zôranazâr could throw at us. When our fleet was repaired and all hope of further survivors vanished, we set sail once more."
 umbar.0108.a:0 "To Tharbad!"
 
 umbar.0109.t:0 "The Wrath of Ulmo"
 umbar.0109.desc:0 "Our vessel shattered by the wrath of the storm, we take many days to make the repairs necessary to sail again. The crew is under no illusion that they too would have met their end to the wrath of Zôranazâr, had not the Witch-Princess Arphazel resorted to her dark magic, calming the seas enough for the ship to escape. The fate of the rest of the royal family none know, yet there is no doubt that they rest now in the embrace of Mulkhêr. No other ships were sighted emerging from the storm ere it dissipated, the might of the [adunai|E] now all but spent, but our spirit endures. Our ambition endures."
 umbar.0109.a:0 "Akallabêth come again!"
 
 umbar.0110.t:0 "The Ruins of Tharbad"
 umbar.0110.desc:0 "At long last, months after setting out from Anagzâyân, the survivors of the great storm have arrived. We saw first the Great Bridge, ruined by the passage of time, and set ashore in the midst of the ancient port. It was that which we first restored, then the walls, and then we looked outward. These wide, empty lands ripe for the taking - in the name of Mulkhêr!"
 umbar.0110.a:0 "A new beginning for our people..."

 umbar.1000.desc:0 "Since the days of the [kinstrife|E], Castamir's descendants have been forced to cower in [umbar|E], denied their rightful birthright by bitter nobles and jealous Stewards. No longer! We shall have our birthright."
 umbar.1000.a:0 "Our day has come! We sail for Gondor!"
 umbar.1000.a.tt:0 "Glory or defeat, it shall be decided today."
 
 umbar.1001.t:0 "The Reigns of Castamir"
 umbar.1001.desc:0 "After a long and brutal campaign, [gondor|E] at last kneels before her rightful king once more. The Stewards have been stripped of their office, and the lords brought to heel. Once more, for the first time since the [kinstrife|E], the line of Castamir rules fair Gondor. But the time has come to make a choice. In our years in exile, we came to name ourselves lord of [umbar|E]. A prestigious name, but not the one we have so long staked a claim to. Shall we reclaim the title of King of Gondor, or shall we remain the King of Umbar?"
 umbar.1001.a:0 "Gondor has always been our true home."
 umbar.1001.b:0 "Gondor shall become part of something greater."
 
 umbar.1002.t:0 "An Invasion from the South!"
 umbar.1002.desc:0 "Reports have come of a great fleet off the coasts of Harondor. The lord of [umbar|E], an alleged descendant of the accursed Castamir the Usurper, has declared his intent to retake his ancestral throne, by force if necessary. The coastal lords are already rallying their forces, and the Sealord of Pelargir has ordered the fleet massed there. \n\nWhatever right Castamir and his kin ever had to the throne of [gondor|E] was rendered null and void in the [kinstrife|E] by right of his tyranny and treason against the rightful king. We cannot allow his descendants to claim something unrightfully theirs!"
 umbar.1002.a:0 "We shall cast this foul usurper back into the Sea, and Gondor will not forget this..."
 
 umbar.0001.t:0 "Unrest in Western Gondor"
 umbar.0001.desc:0 "My lord, there is news of great unrest in the western frontier of [gondor|E]. Perhaps this is an opportunity? These Wildmen factions are more than eager to raid and harass Gondor's western borders. If we were to fund one of these groups, they could prove valuable to our future places of reclamation."
 umbar.0001.a:0 "We shall fund these Wildmen."
 umbar.0001.tt:0 "A decision to fund a Wildmen invasion of Gondor is available while you have the Black Lord of Umbar modifier."
 umbar.0001.b:0 "We don't require the aid of savages to take back what is ours!"

 umbar.0002.t:0 "Unrest in Western Gondor"
 umbar.0002.desc:0 "The Wildmen have accepted our offer and an invasion into [gondor|E] has been launched! We shall have to make certain to watch any further developments closely..."
 umbar.0002.a:0 "Good, Gondor's loss is our gain."

 umbar.0003.t:0 "Unrest in Western Gondor"
 umbar.0003.desc:0 "The Wildmen have declined our offer; no invasion shall be launched. Thankfully, the brutes were honourable enough to return the funds we had given them."
 umbar.0003.a:0 "A pity, they seemed capable enough."

 umbar.0004.t:0 "Unrest in Western Gondor"
 umbar.0004.desc:0 "The Wildmen have declined our offer; no invasion will be launched. To add insult to injury, the scoundrels have seemingly decided to keep our funds for themselves!"
 umbar.0004.a:0 "How dare they!"
 
 umbar.1003.t:0 "A New Capital?"
 umbar.1003.desc:0 "Now that the realm of Gondor has finally been unified under its rightful King, the question remains, from where shall we rule our great Kingdom. Some voices are calling for us to take the old seat of [gondor|E] and rule the Kingdom from there. Meanwhile others want us to retain our ancient seat of [umbar|E]. Finally, some remember the reign of King Castamir I of Gondor and want us to make [GetTitleByKey('c_pelargir').GetNameNoTier] our capital due to its historical importance and strategic positioning in between the two halves of our realm."
 umbar.1003.a:0 "Minas Tirith shall be our capital."
 umbar.1003.b:0 "Restored Osgiliath shall be our seat."
 umbar.1003.c:0 "We shall honour Castamir and make Pelargir the capital."
 umbar.1003.d:0 "Umbar is and shall remain the core of our Kingdom."

Though I have both Câssimir and Burôdapân under my sway, so long as Kathuphazgân still lives, my influence shall be only marginal. \n\nAnd that is assuming that he does not move against me in some form. No. Kathuphazgân shall need to be... disposed of. He is old, and gout-ridden - surely it will come to the surprise of none when at he meets his tragic demise..."

 umbar.0202.desc:0 "The hour is late, and the pain of my gout flares. With an aching groan, I get up from my bed, struggling to make it to my medicine. It had come at high price, imported from distant lands far to the south. \n\nSuddenly, I hear noises behind me. I whirl around but see nothing. Unnoticed by me, slithe forms slide through the shadows of the room, taking up positions, as if to strike. Gathering my composure once more, I turn to my medicine once again. \n\nAnd gazing into my eyes, are two slits, set in yellow, in a form black as night. I begin to rear back in surprise, when I suddenly feel weights fall upon me on all sides. \n\nI stumble, trying to throw them off me, but then one gets under my leg! Flailing, I fall forward, and my head slams down hard upon the desk's edge. My mind goes blank, and I slide to the floor..."
 umbar.0202.a:0 "There is nothing. Nothing but the endless sleep."
 
 umbar.0203.t:0 "To Kill a King"
 umbar.0203.desc:0 "Success! Kathuphazgân has passed after an unfortunate fall in the night. His personal physician, looking him over, believes that after experiencing a gout attack, he tried to retrieve his medicine, but fell and smashed his head into the edge of his desk! Not a trace of my involvement. \n\nCâssimir and Burôdapân both are bereaved, for while they have little patience for each other, they both loved their father. They shall need comfort in their time of grief - and afterwards, a new [umbar|E] will rise. One with a brother in the city, and another leading the fleets... and the queen, who rules both from the shadows."

After generations of rivalry and strife between the two havens, the uniting of the two has brought much needed prosperity to the area.\n\nWith full control over the mouth of the Harnen, we control and regulate a massive portion of all trade entering [harad|E]. Due to this, the region has already recieved fruitful returns.\n\nWhereas once the region was marked by a tug-of-war over trade rights, now the havens march towards a richer future!"
