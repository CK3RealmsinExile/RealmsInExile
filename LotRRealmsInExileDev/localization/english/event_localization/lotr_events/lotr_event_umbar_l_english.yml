 ### Ar-Adunaim ###
 umbar.0100.t:0 "The Exiles of Ar-Adûnâim"
 umbar.0100.desc:0 "On a lonely archipelago in the sea of Belegaer is the self-proclaimed Ar-Adûnâim. Those who visit it may find two different experiences. Those who bear the blood of Númenor find a welcoming group which carries itself with dignity and honour. Those that do not, however, find themselves abused and spat upon, detested, and treated like nothing more than feral dogs. Such is the nature of this exiled group of blood purists, cast out from the Haven of Umbar for their radical views. \n\nArising shortly after the arrival of Castimir the Usurper in Umbar, for years the blood-purists were merely another faction within Umbar — in fact, there is still a strong one in Umbar even after their departure. But the Ar-Adûnâim began to agitate for a great 'cleansing' of the Havens, which would bring about a restoration of Númenórean purity and be the herald of a glorious reclamation of their long-lost empire. Pragmatists in Umbar ultimately were forced to act when a rally transformed into a lynch mob that resulted in a fire which devastated a large section of the port. \n\nSince then, the Ar-Adûnâim have stewed on their rocks in the sea, awaiting the beginning of their great crusade. Their leader, Gimilkhâd, claims to have spoken with his august ancestor Ar-Pharazôn through the mediation of the Great Lord, Mulkhêr. If they keep the faith, and offer sacrifices in his name, then the Great Lord shall bring forth the Great Armament, and the armies of Anadûnê shall once more roll over the land."
 umbar.0100.a:0 "The Reclamation is coming. Anadûnê shall rise again!"
 umbar.0100.a.tt:0 "From this searock fortress we will reclaim the legacy of Númenor."

 umbar.0102.t:0 "The Ar-Adûnâim Return to Umbar"
 umbar.0102.desc.a:0 "I stride off the ship, my brow held high. The wharfs are damaged from battle, both recent and old, but are still usable. Behind me, a loyal retinue of my best soldiers form an honor guard. \n\nI stalk up to the mansions at the top of the city, the seat of the fools who had once banished us from our city, the city of Ar-Pharazôn our forefather, of our people! The local people quail as I stride towards it. They shall have their turn for judgement. \n\nAt last arriving at the mansions which form the heart of the government of Umbar, I have brought before me all the local elites who did not manage to flee. I decree those of Númenórean descent are to be spared, provided they swear fealty to the true king of the Adûnai. Those who are not... well. They should not have desecrated this city with their presence."
 umbar.0102.desc.b:0 "In a shocking reversal, the once-exiled blood-purists of the Ar-Adûnâim have seized the havens of Umbar. Thought to have been exiled to their deaths on a barren archipelago far off the coast of Umbar, somehow, they have managed to amass a force sufficient to take it by storm. \n\n[adunaim_conquerer.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], master of the Ar-Adûnâim, has decreed all those unable to prove a high degree of Númenórean descent are to be exiled from the haven proper, and has already set to purging what remains of the city's old administration. \n\nWhat will happen next remains to be seen."
 umbar.0102.a:0 "Let the havens be cleansed."
 umbar.0102.b:0 "Nothing good can come of this."
 
 adunaim.0001.t:0 "Rumors of Lost Glory"
 adunaim.0001.desc:0 "Since our exile from Umbar at the hands of the so-called 'pragmatists' we of the Ar-Adûnâim have heard many rumours from the mainland. The Corsair-Lords mutter still about the unfortunate fire in the great haven itself, fuming ever more loudly about our continued freedom on these barren islands. While it has been our goal to build a city here, a new Arminaleth in Middle-Earth, there are many more places in this world where the great Númenórean Empire once held sway - and many of these have fallen into disrepair. One such stronghold, the great city of Tharbad, screams out for strong hand. A Númenórean hand. \n\nShall we leave these islands and the judgement of lesser Men behind us and brave the wrath of the sea to claim dominion over the ruins of a new land? Shall we bring the might of the Adûnai once more to the desolate wilderness of Eriador, its iron rule to what backwards peasants we find there?"
 adunaim.0001.a:0 "Begin preparations at once"
 adunaim.0001.b:0 "I will not resign myself to a ruin"
 
 adunaim.0002.t:0 "Setting Sail to Tharbad"
 adunaim.0002.desc:0 "All is made ready - the ships are set, the Adûnai eager for new lands free for the taking. As the sun rises the fleet of the Ar-Adûnâim raise their sails, offering prayers to Mulkhêr for calm seas and swift winds as our former home dwindles behind the horizon, leaving nothing in any direction but sea."
 adunaim.0002.a:0 "Mulkhêr, grant us a favourable wind!"
 
 adunaim.0003.t:0 "Life at Sea"
 adunaim.0003.desc:0 "Many days have passed since we sailed from Anagzâyân, many days filled with nought but the sight and smell of the sea. By our estimation, we have yet some days to travel ere we reach our goal, the mouth of the Gwathlo, when the winds that had brought us this far died down. The monotony of our voyage grows unbearable in the days that followed, making no discernible progress under power of our oars or the sails. Yet even this dull state seemed like a blessing when we spied the gathering storm clouds in the distance, while we could do little but pray they passed us by."
 adunaim.0003.a:0 "Mulkhêr, let the storm pass us by!"

 adunaim.0004.t:0 "Stormy Waters"
 adunaim.0004.desc:0 "Alas, our prayers proved fruitless as the storm only grew stronger and closer, crashing at last into our fleet. The waves churned our vessels, the sheeting rain blinding us to all beyond the bows of our ships. And yet the storm raged on. For what seemed like an eternity we were battered with wind and waves, separated from the rest of the fleet. Waves washing over the decks swept many sailors caught unawares to a watery grave before at last the clouds parted, the sea calmed and the wind relented, revealing to us our goal - the coast of Eriador, the mouth of the Gwathlo. Limping forth from the storm, we set to repairing our ship and waiting to see if any other vessels had survived the onslaught of the sea."
 adunaim.0004.a:0 "How many have survived?"
 
 adunaim.0005.t:0 "Tulmultuous Waves"
 adunaim.0005.desc:0 "Over the course of a day many more of our ships emerged from the storm, making towards us with what haste they could muster. Though badly damaged, our armada remained mostly intact, with those losses we suffered keenly felt yet acceptable for those who survived the fury of Zôranazâr."
 adunaim.0005.a:0 "And so we continue"
 
 adunaim.0006.t:0 "Ruinous Waves"
 adunaim.0006.desc:0 "The storm rages out at sea while we repair our ship and slowly some more of our ships emerge from the tumult, all sitting low in the water limping slowly to shore. Our losses were great, our once mighty armaga reduced to a bare half of its original strength. And yet, we survived. Battered and bruised, yes, but we survived all that Zôranazâr could throw at us. When our fleet was repaired and all hope of further survivors vanished, we set sail once more."
 adunaim.0006.a:0 "To Tharbad!"
 
 adunaim.0007.t:0 "The Wrath of Ulmo"
 adunaim.0007.desc:0 "Our vessel shattered by the wrath of the storm, we take many days to make the repairs necessary to sail again. The crew is under no illusion that they too would have met their end to the wrath of Zôranazâr had not the Witch-Princess Arphazel resorted to her dark magic, calming the seas enough for the ship to escape. The fate of the rest of the royal family none know, yet there is no doubt that they rest now in the embrace of Mulkhêr. No other ships were sighted emerging from the storm ere it dissipated, the might of the Adûnai now all but spent, but our spirit endures. Our ambition endures."
 adunaim.0007.a:0 "Akallabêth come again!"
 
 adunaim.0008.t:0 "The Ruins of Tharbad"
 adunaim.0008.desc:0 "At long last, months after setting out from Anagzâyân, the survivors of the great storm have arrived. We saw first the Great Bridge, ruined by the passage of time, and set ashore in the midst of the ancient port. It was that which we first restored, then the walls, and then we looked outward. These wide, empty lands ripe for the taking - in the name of Mulkhêr!"
 adunaim.0008.a:0 "A new beginning for our people..."

 ### Umbar ###
 umbar.0200.t:0 "The Heir of Castamir"
 umbar.0200.desc:0 "Since the days of the Kin-Strife, Umbar has been the refuge of the blood of Castamir, rightful king of Gondor. However, Umbar has been too disunified to truly pose any threat to Gondor. \n\nRoughly 30 years ago, the previous master of Umbar, Azûlzîr, began to test Gondor's defences. Gondor was not caught unaware, however, and slipping through the defences of Umbar by night, the daring captain Thorongil set the port — and the fleet — ablaze. Azûlzîr met him in personal combat as Thorongil covered his men's retreat, but Thorongil was the mightier, and slew him. \n\nThus did Kathuphazgân become lord in Umbar, but he inherited not a mighty realm, a dread across all the shores of Gondor, but one in freefall. The hinterlands, never truly brought to heel and colonised, swiftly broke away, and blood purists in Umbar started a riot which further damaged the port, leading to their exile. After many years of careful stewardship, Kathuphazgân has led Umbar back to a semblance of order, with honeyed words and judicious application of force. But he desires greater honour and glory, and to at last place his family upon the Gondorian throne. His sons are full grown and powerful men, yet there are concerns of a growing rivalry between the two concerning the succession..."
 umbar.0200.a:0 "But first, the hinterlands must be brought to heel."
 umbar.0200.a.tt:0 "Some of the legates of the hinterlands will accept your overlordship by careful diplomacy, but others shall need force."
 
 umbar.1000.t:0 "The Castmiri Claim"
 umbar.1000.desc:0 "Since the days of the Kin-Strife, Castamir's descendants have been forced to cower in Umbar, denied their rightful birthright by bitter nobles and jealous stewards. No longer! We shall have our birthright."
 umbar.1000.a:0 "Our day has come! We sail for Gondor!"
 umbar.1000.a.tt:0 "Glory or defeat, it shall be decided today."
 
 umbar.1001.t:0 "The Reigns of Castamir"
 umbar.1001.desc:0 "After a long and brutal campaign, Gondor at last kneels before her rightful king once more. The stewards have been stripped of their office, and the lords brought to heel. Once more the line of Castamir rules fair Gondor. But the time has come to make a choice. In our years in exile, we came to name ourselves lord of Umbar. A prestigious name, but not the one we have so long staked a claim to. Shall we reclaim the title of King of Gondor, or shall we remain the King of Umbar?"
 umbar.1001.a:0 "Gondor has always been our true home."
 umbar.1001.b:0 "Gondor shall become part of something greater."
 
 umbar.1002.t:0 "An Invasion from the South!"
 umbar.1002.desc:0 "Reports have come of a great fleet off the coasts of Harondor. The lord of Umbar, descendant of the accursed Castamir the Usurper, has declared his intent to retake his ancestral throne, by force if necessary. The coastal lords are already rallying their forces, and the Sealord of Pelargir has ordered the fleet massed there. \n\nWhatever right Castamir and his kin ever had to the throne of Gondor was rendered null and void, by right of his tyranny and treason against the rightful king. We cannot allow his descendants to claim something unrightfully theirs!"
 umbar.1002.a:0 "We shall cast this foul usurper back into the Sea, and Gondor will not forget this..."
 
 umbar.0001.t:0 "Unrest in Western Gondor"
 umbar.0001.desc:0 "My lord, there is news of great unrest in the western frontier of Gondor. Perhaps this is an opportunity? These Wildmen factions are more than eager to raid and harass Gondor's western borders. If we were to fund one of these groups, they could prove valuable to our future places of reclamation."
 umbar.0001.a:0 "We shall fund these Wildmen."
 umbar.0001.tt:0 "A decision to fund a Wildmen invasion of Gondor is available while you have the Black Lord of Umbar modifier."
 umbar.0001.b:0 "We don't require the aid of savages to take back what is ours!"

 umbar.0002.t:0 "Unrest in Western Gondor"
 umbar.0002.desc:0 "The Wildmen have accepted our offer and an invasion into Gondor has been launched! We shall have to make certain to watch any further developments closely..."
 umbar.0002.a:0 "Good, Gondor's loss is our gain."

 umbar.0003.t:0 "Unrest in Western Gondor"
 umbar.0003.desc:0 "The Wildmen have declined our offer; no invasion shall be launched. Thankfully, the brutes were honourable enough to return the funds we had given them."
 umbar.0003.a:0 "A pity, they seemed capable enough."

 umbar.0004.t:0 "Unrest in Western Gondor"
 umbar.0004.desc:0 "The Wildmen have declined our offer; no invasion will be launched. To add insult to injury, the scoundrels have seemingly decided to keep our funds for themselves!"
 umbar.0004.a:0 "How dare they!"
 
 umbar.1003.t:0 "A New Capital?"
 umbar.1003.desc:0 "Now that the realm of Gondor has finally been unified under its rightful King, the question remains, from where shall we rule our great Kingdom. Some voices are calling for us to take the old seat of Gondor and rule the Kingdom from there. Meanwhile others want us to retain our ancient seat of Umbar. Finally, some remember the reign of King Castamir I of Gondor and want us to make Pelargir our capital due to its historical importance and strategic positioning in between the two halves of our realm."
 umbar.1003.a:0 "Minas Tirith shall be our capital."
 umbar.1003.b:0 "Restored Osgiliath shall be our seat."
 umbar.1003.c:0 "We shall honour Castamir and make Pelargir the capital."
 umbar.1003.d:0 "Umbar is and shall remain the core of our Kingdom."
 
 umbar.0201.t:0 "To Kill a King"
 umbar.0201.desc:0 "Kathuphazgân, my beloved husband's father, is a roadblock to my ambitions. Though I have both Câssimir and Burôdapân under my sway, so long as Kathuphazgân still lives, my influence shall be only marginal. \n\nAnd that is assuming that he does not move against me in some form. No. Kathuphazgân shall need to be... disposed of. He is old, and gout-ridden - surely it will come to the surprise of none when at he meets his tragic demise..."
 umbar.0201.a:0 "To kill a king is no small matter."
 umbar.0201.a.tt:0 "Kathuphazgân shall breathe his last."
 
 umbar.0202.t:0 "Eyes in the Darkness"
 umbar.0202.desc:0 "The hour is late, and the pain of my gout flares. With an aching groan, I get up from my bed, struggling to make it to my medicine. It had come at high price, imported from distant lands far to the south. \n\nSuddenly, I hear noises behind me. I whirl around but see nothing. Unnoticed by me, slithe forms slide through the shadows of the room, taking up positions, as if to strike. Gathering my composure once more, I turn to my medicine once again. \n\nAnd gazing into my eyes, are two slits, set in yellow, in a form black as night. I begin to rear back in surprise, when I suddenly feel weights fall upon me on all sides. \n\nI stumble, trying to throw them off me, but then one gets under my leg! Flailing, I fall forward, and my head slams down hard upon the desk's edge. My mind goes blank, and I slide to the floor..."
 umbar.0202.a:0 "There is nothing. Nothing but the endless sleep."
 
 umbar.0203.t:0 "To Kill a King"
 umbar.0203.desc:0 "Success! Kathuphazgân has passed after an unfortunate fall in the night. His personal physician, looking him over, believes that after experiencing a gout attack, he tried to retrieve his medicine, but fell and smashed his head into the edge of his desk! Not a trace of my involvement. \n\nCâssimir and Burôdapân both are bereaved, for while they have little patience for each other, they both loved their father. They shall need comfort in their time of grief - and afterwards, a new Umbar will rise. One with a brother in the city, and another leading the fleets... and the queen, who rules both from the shadows."
 umbar.0203.a:0 "After all... every king needs his queen, right?"

 umbar.1600.t:0 "The Call of the Seas"
 umbar.1600.desc:0 "I stand at the shore watching my men readying my fleets for plunder. The newer ships in the fleet feature broader holds and bigger sails than the older - More stores for gold, goods and slaves.\n\nI have chosen the life of a corsair, as I cannot resist the temptation of sweet plunder." #juke note: make better
 umbar.1600.a:0 "It's a corsair's life for me."

 umbar.1601.t:0 "Chained Flow"
 umbar.1601.desc:0 "The consolidation of Ramlond and Mirlond bolsters our military might but also sweetens our financial situation. With complete control over the mouth of the Harnen, a large chain now runs its breath and a new tollbooth has been installed to bolster our coffers with each passing ship's gold.\n\nAlready, this has yielded fruitful results. With the havens being the only access to the river, nothing stops our men from demanding the merchants pay the toll twice!\n\nWhenever a vessel claims to be incapable of affording passage, it is seized on the spot and made ready for Corsair service!"
 umbar.1601.a:0 "Some pay in gold, some in blood."
