 rhudaur.0001.desc:0 "In the northern hills of [rhudaur|e], a realm now steeped in solitude and whispers of antiquity, small tribes of survivors eke out an existence hidden from the notice of [dunedain|e] and [elves|e] alike. These folk, descendants of a once-proud kingdom lost to the mists of time, cling to a tenuous thread of oral tradition, weaving tales of ancient kings and faded glory around their hearthfires. Amidst their struggle for survival, they must also contend with the looming threat of wilderness predators, such as Trolls descending from the Ettenmoors, whose presence in the rugged terrain adds a perilous dimension to their daily lives.\n\nThrough generations of hardship and seclusion, the tribes of [rhudaur|e] have preserved fragmented legends of Arnor's past, speaking in hushed tones of [elendil|e], [isildur|e], and the Tower of Amon Sûl. Yet, these stories are but shadows, bereft of factual detail, shrouded by the passage of ages and the isolation of their mountain fastness. In this forgotten corner of Middle-earth, survival is the paramount concern, and the tales of bygone kings serve as a bittersweet reminder of a heritage that lingers like mist upon the hills, elusive and intangible."
