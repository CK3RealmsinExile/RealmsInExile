 rhudaur.0001.t:0 "Echoes of Rhudaur"
 rhudaur.0001.desc:0 "In the northern hills of [rhudaur|e], a realm now steeped in solitude and whispers of antiquity, small tribes of survivors eke out an existence hidden from the notice of [dunedain|e] and [elves|e] alike. These folk, descendants of a once-proud kingdom lost to the mists of time, cling to a tenuous thread of oral tradition, weaving tales of ancient kings and faded glory around their hearthfires. Amidst their struggle for survival, they must also contend with the looming threat of wilderness predators, such as Trolls descending from the Ettenmoors, whose presence in the rugged terrain adds a perilous dimension to their daily lives.\n\nThrough generations of hardship and seclusion, the tribes of [rhudaur|e] have preserved fragmented legends of Arnor's past, speaking in hushed tones of [elendil|e], [isildur|e], and the Tower of Amon Sûl. Yet, these stories are but shadows, bereft of factual detail, shrouded by the passage of ages and the isolation of their mountain fastness. In this forgotten corner of Middle-earth, survival is the paramount concern, and the tales of bygone kings serve as a bittersweet reminder of a heritage that lingers like mist upon the hills, elusive and intangible."

Smoke rises from crude encampments, echoing with the clang of forges and the guttural cries of war. It is imperative to confront this growing menace and disrupt their plans before they spill further into your realm."

Perhaps it is time to deploy your most skilled infiltrators to sabotage the orcish war effort without alerting their forces to your presence.\n\nUnder the cover of night, you lead a select group of stealthy warriors towards the orc encampment. The air is heavy with the stench of their forges and the echo of their war drums."
