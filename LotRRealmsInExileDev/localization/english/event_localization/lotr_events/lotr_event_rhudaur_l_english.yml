 rhudaur.1000.desc:0 "Hearing reports of Orc activity, my companions and I decide to venture deep into the long-abandoned lands of [rhudaur_province.GetName], where the shadow of the North looms ominously. Incoming reports from my scouts confirm the presence of marauding orc tribes roaming nearby. These brutal orcs, coming from [angmar|e], the [mistymountains|e], or the [GetTitleByKey('c_ettenmoors').GetNameNoTier], seek to establish a foothold in these cursed lands, threatening the safety of my realm.\n\nAs my party and I traverse the dense forests and mist-shrouded valleys, signs of orc activity grow evident. Black smoke rises on the horizon, and soon we find the source: A crude orcish encampment, echoing with the clang of forges and the guttural cries of war, sits upon a nearby hill. It is imperative for me to confront this growing menace and vanquish them before they spill further into my realm."

 rhudaur.1001.desc:0 "A report from one of my scouts reveals a menacing orc camp on the outskirts of [rhudaur_province.GetName]. These savage creatures threaten the safety of my realm, but direct confrontation could invite greater dangers. A more cunning and subtle approach is necessary. Instead, leading an infiltration to sabotage the orcish war effort without alerting their forces to your presence would be much wiser.\n\nIt is imperative I act now, lest the orcs grow strong and bold enough to cause damage to my realm."

 rhudaur.1002.t:0 "[rhudaur_province.GetName]: Stone at Dawn"
 rhudaur.1002.desc:0 "My company and I traverse the rugged lands of [rhudaur_province.GetName], venturing through forests of gnarled black trees and over high hills. Our travels were mostly uneventful so far, yet as we travel through another forest, we reach a large glade. Just ahead of us stands a band of trolls, tall and broad. They do not spot us yet, but these creatures pose a grave threat to travelers and settlements alike. I recall that trolls turn to stone when exposed to sunlight, and endeavour to get rid of these foul beasts lest they raid a village or slaughter an unwitting band of travellers.\n\nI step forth into the glade, deciding to confront the trolls not with swords, but with words. A fight would be almost certain death, but if I can keep the trolls enganged with my words until the first light of day, no weapons need be drawn."
 rhudaur.1002.a:0 "[companion1.GetName], ask them if they think humans taste like chicken. That ought to keep them occupied!"
 rhudaur.1002.duel_success:0 "The trolls don't notice the sun until it is too late and turn into stone"

 rhudaur.1003.desc:0 "My plan of conversing with the trolls until the sun rose having obviously failed, I must decide how my company will confront these formidable --and now quite irritated-- creatures again. I survey the trolls, their eyes glinting with a mix of curiosity, hostility, and hunger. Mostly the latter two. Wary of repeating my previous diplomatic efforts, I weigh your options carefully."
 rhudaur.1003.a:0 "Offer them gold to let us go."
 rhudaur.1003.a.duel_success:0 "The trolls agree to accept the bribe and depart...for now"

My efforts have restored a sense of safety and tranquility to the land."
 rhudaur.1004.a:0 "[ROOT.Char.GetCapitalLocation.GetTitle.GetNameNoTier] is safer now!"

 rhudaur.1005.t:0 "Hilltop Summit"
 rhudaur.1005.desc:0 "As I step out to greet them, all the Hill-chiefs sit in obedient silence. I feel the spirits of my ancestors standing beside me, filling me with pride while I prepare to assume the mantle of King.\n\nPreviously, the now distant Ranger-lords occupied our land and oppressed us. Their rule ended when the Shadow brought destruction to the Highmen. Yet, during their downfall, we were also consumed by their terrible war.\n\nUntil today, reuniting the scattered tribes was deemed impossible. Nevertheless, owing to the strength and resilience of my people, I have reclaimed what has always been rightfully ours; the rule of all Rhudaur.\n\nEvery stone laid in the reconstruction of our kingdom brings honour to the memory of our forefathers. Now our borders stand firm, our banners unfurled, and we will keep our realm, not as subjects, but as rulers."
 rhudaur.1005.a:0 "No longer will Rhudaur be a mere footnote in the annals of history."
