 ### Nurnoth Events ###
 nurnoth.0004.t:0 "The Sun Shines over Núrn"
 nurnoth.0004.desc:0 "After the defeat of [sauroncharacter|E], the enslaved [slave_leader.GetCulture.GetName] people, aided by my host, rose up and overthrew their oppressors under the leadership of [slave_leader.GetFirstName].\n\nA man of haggard eyes and unassuming clothes, [slave_leader.GetFirstName] is ushered before me. He bows and offers his genuine -though reserved- thanks to me before making his request. "The servants and agents of the [darklord|E] are still abound, my lord, and our once masters shall seek again to bring us into servitude. We humbly request for your protection, lest we, in our weakened state, fall again into our former condition."\n\nHe is right; yet should I give my protection to the people of [nurn|E] without repayment? Or perhaps it is best we focus on our own ends?"
 nurnoth.0004.a:0 "We will protect you, but you must provide food for our armies"
 nurnoth.0004.a.tt:0 "[GetTitleByKey('k_nurn').GetName] will become your [client_state|E]"
 nurnoth.0004.b:0 "I give you my word, I will protect your freedom"
 nurnoth.0004.b.tt:0 "[GetTitleByKey('k_nurn').GetName] will become your [protectorate|E]"
 nurnoth.0004.c:0 "I wish you good fortune in the years to come"
