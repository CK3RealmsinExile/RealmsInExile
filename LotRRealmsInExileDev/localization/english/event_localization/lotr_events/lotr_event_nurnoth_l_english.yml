 ### Nurnoth Events ###
 nurnoth.0004.t:0 "The Sun Shines over Núrn"
 nurnoth.0004.desc:0 "After the defeat of [sauroncharacter|E], the enslaved [slave_leader.GetCulture.GetName] people, aided by my host, rose up and overthrew their oppressors under the leadership of [slave_leader.GetFirstName].\n\nA man of haggard eyes and unassuming clothes, [slave_leader.GetFirstName] is ushered before me. He bows and offers his genuine -though reserved- thanks to me before making his request. "The servants and agents of the [darklord|E] are still abound, my lord, and our once masters shall seek again to bring us into servitude. We humbly request for your protection, lest we, in our weakened state, fall again into our former condition."\n\nHe is right; yet should I give my protection to the people of [nurn|E] without repayment? Or perhaps it is best we focus on our own ends?"
 nurnoth.0004.a:0 "We will protect you, but you must provide food for our armies"
 nurnoth.0004.a.tt:0 "[GetTitleByKey('k_nurn').GetName] will become your [client_state|E]"
 nurnoth.0004.b:0 "I give you my word, I will protect your freedom"
 nurnoth.0004.b.tt:0 "[GetTitleByKey('k_nurn').GetName] will become your [protectorate|E]"
 nurnoth.0004.c:0 "I wish you good fortune in the years to come"
 
 nurnoth.0005.t:0 "The Sun Shines over Núrn"
 nurnoth.0005.desc:0 "With the [darklord|E] vanquished and the host of [mordor|E] scattered, the Free Peoples of [middleearth|E] now reign triumphant over even the darkest places of the world. For a time, at least, the shadow is passing and the simple yet hardy people of [nurn|E] are free to govern their lands in peace. \n\nYet the question remains: will they unite and stand fearless in the face of darkness, or fall back into slavery beneath the might of their neighbors?"
 nurnoth.0005.a:0 "I wish them well, but I now must return to other matters"
 nurnoth.0005.b:0 "I wonder how they will fare..."
 
nurnoth.0006.t:0 "The Ashes of the Slave Markets of Thaurband"
nurnoth.0006.desc:0 "The former slave markets of Thuarband sit empty, filled only with rubble and ash. We must decide what we will build in their place, or if we shall leave the vast lands empty, to be filled in as the city grows."
nurnoth.0006.a:0 "We will build a monument out of the iron used for our chains!"
nurnoth.0006.b:0 "We will cultivate a grove in honour of Ivann, our patroness who led us through this dark time."
nurnoth.0006.c:0 "We will build a house in which we will discuss how we will rule [nurn|E]."
nurnoth.0006.d:0 "We will leave the land fallow for a time, then allow for it to be built over."
