 orcs.3003.desc:0 "It's been a year since my training started. A year of death and pain, anger and hatred. My senses have been sharpened.

 orcs.2002.t:0 "A Young Champion"
 orcs.2002.desc:0 "It has not been difficult to track him down.

 orcs.2002.d.tt:0 "You leave hoping that this has no major significance."

 orcs.2003.t:0 "A Loyal Champion"
 orcs.2003.desc:0 "After several nights of laughter and grog, [strongorc.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] and I have become inseparable.\n\nWhile I admire his might, he has found in me a figure of command, his natural leader.\n\nToday he has sworn his eternal loyalty to me and I will accept his services as his lord and friend."
