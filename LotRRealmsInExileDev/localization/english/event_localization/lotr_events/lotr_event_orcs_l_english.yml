The mighty orc chieftain has been killed by the horrid Tark [dunedain_chieftain.GetName] - his black blood stains the dwarf-hewn floor, as the great chief stands over him, bloodied blade in hand! Grey eyes pierce the darkness, and the tall warrior begins to stride forward. No, no, we cannot bear it! Run away, run away! Azog is dead - the Orcs are doomed!"

 orcs.7205.desc:0 "My scouts bring me news - a great host of Dúnedain, grey-eyed and tall and stern, gather in Eriador. With them are dour-handed dwarves and steely elf-soldiers! They plan on marching into the Misty Mountains, and throwing me down! I clench my fist and sound my bellowing horn, and my soldiers begin to assemble.\n\n#italic But I am scared!#! The Tarks are bad enough without the Dwarves and Orcs fighting alongside them - most wars like that only end in slaughter for me and my folk. But hate turns to rage as my eyes glimmer, and I curse and stamp my feet, and draw my curved blade. Let them come! This time history will turn. This time, the Tarks and their stinking allies will be beat back by the Orcs! By the Master! By... AZOG!"
 orcs.7205.a:0 "We will break them utterly!"
