But thy Master calls to you - yea, the master of all of thy race, and the race of Men also. In Dol Guldur He awaits you, and if thou are deserving maybe He shall grant you His favor." \n\nMy boys grumble and posture after the black figure leaves, talking about how they would have cut him up if he said one more word.

A larger party means more loot, maybe, but they'll be slower - a smaller group will be quicker about their looting and killing! And should I go out as well? I've been itching for a good house-burning recently, but it's safer back here at home."

More surprising is the identity of the Orc. Though it takes me some time to remember him, I finally realize who [hand_of_azog.GetFirstNameNicknamed] was... I guess he didn't take my refusal too well! Ha! Ha!\n\nWell, I will teach him a more lasting lesson today. I ready my armor and call on my soldiers. We will break [hand_of_azog.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] and his forces, and then I will carve my name on his forehead, like I have done before!"

 orcs.7202.desc: "I am resting in my halls when, far away, I hear screams and sounds of metal on metal. Another skirmish between my unruly subjects, I reckon - I don't let it distract me from my well-deserved rest. But then, a few quavering orcs scamper through my guards and fall at my feet, where I sit upon my great chair. Intrigued, I bid them speak\n\n"Oh m-mighty Azog - the Tark-chief is here!" Roused, I fly for my blades, while my soldiers armor me. The cowards that brought me the message can suffer later - for now, swords are pressed into their hands and helms on their heads. As my steel-clad bodyguard and I stalk towards the Western Gate, I see a great shadow on the wall - a Dúnedain-soldier carrying a horrid blade, and for a moment I blanch and think of turning tail. But fear gives way to hate - [dunedain_chieftain.GetName] will be crushed by my hand, and his body fed to black crows!"
 orcs.7202.a: "I will crush this these Tarks with ease."

Me and my boys begin to laugh, and our hideous chorus - like gravel on stone - breaks those of faint-heart, and some of their number begin edging back to the gate. One of the braver ones prepares a javelin to throw at my throat, but my bodyguard forms a wall of shields around me. "Kill them all! Bring their bodies to me!" I raise my sword, and orcs, merely watching before, begin streaming into the rooms, peppering the Tarks with poison-arrows. They put up a great resistance, and indeed kill some of my soldiers, but by and large they are slain or forced to flee.\n\nWe cut up the bodies that remain and feed them to the carrion-crows outside, while I revel in my strength. I am Azog! I slew the great warrior! #italic I am the master!#!"

The mighty orc chieftain has been killed by the horrid Tark [dunedain_chieftain.GetName] - his black blood stains the dwarf-hewn floor, as the great chief stands over him, bloodied blade in hand!

They plan on marching into the Misty Mountains, and throwing me down! I clench my fist and sound my bellowing horn, and my soldiers begin to assemble.\n\n#italic But I am scared!#! The Tarks are bad enough without the Dwarves and Orcs fighting alongside them - most wars like that only end in slaughter for me and my folk. But hate turns to rage as my eyes glimmer, and I curse and stamp my feet, and draw my curved blade. Let them come! This time history will turn. This time, the Tarks and their stinking allies will be beat back by the Orcs! By the Master! By... AZOG!"
 orcs.7205.a: "We will break them utterly!"
