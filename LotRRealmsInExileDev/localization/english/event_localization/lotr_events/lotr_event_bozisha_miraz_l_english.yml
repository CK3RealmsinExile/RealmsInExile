And we diminished, as is the way of things. But now there is a lord upon the throne of the Zajantak, and we are once again strong.\n\nMy people rejoice in their newfound strength, but we are not fools. The Thôn an-Khârlôkh has always taken some interest in the kinsmen of their slaves, and seeing us strong must have them wrathful.\n\nNow we come to a great juncture - this may well be the great battle of our time, and though we may win or lose, songs will be sung through the forests by the very birds and apes themselves, and the great Mûmakil will trumpet the stories of the war to come."

How long have we waited for the day to challenge them? How many stories have we forgotten, and freedoms have we lost, in service to the ever-growing [stormhost|E]?

We have kept our lands and majesty for a thousand-thousand years upon end, and those who serve us know their place well, or else have been reminded of it time and time again. Was it our folly, then, to let some of their kinsmen stay in the North? Maybe.\n\nNow, those few scattered tribesmen have united! Under [zajantak_king.GetTitledFirstName], our old enemy, the [Glossary('Mîyanâi','miyanai_gloss')] of Zajantak, once crushed by our conquests and great raids, have risen again.

  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0335.desc: "Recently, worrying reports of spying in the capital have led to the no too shocking discovery that [mardat.GetTitledFirstName] of Suza-Rîy, a lord of the eastern frontier, is plotting to overthrow Kanivâtra rule over [ray|e]. \n\nThough his long standing radicalism and worship of the strange Khäz-gramaze had always put him at odds with central authority, I had still hoped that the tolerance and great legitimacy of our ruling house would have kept such rebellions in check. Clearly, I was wrong. \n\nI must now think of a response to [mardat.GetTitledFirstName]'s treason and there can only really be one. If I do not stand up against him now, he very well may make an intervention against him far too costly... "

  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0336.desc: "As my plot to take power over [ray|e] continues, it becomes clear that the full realization of my grand plans will require the support of the capital guard. Thanks to my agents, I have been able to learn much about [guard_leader.GetTitledFirstName], captain of the city's guard. The captain may be a Vâtraist, but he is not too strong in his beliefs and his great ambitions could very well make him a fine candidate to betray his liege. \n\nBefore I approach him, I must decide a course of action to take to try to win him to my side. I could simply offer to bribe him with great gold and treasures yet it is likely my quest for allies will leave my coffers rather empty. Alternatively, I could offer to grant him lordship over my current lands after my ascension as I will be ruling over the hearthlands of Rây after my victory. I could also seek to convert him to the great darkness of Khäz-gramaze and convince him to join my cause."

  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0337.desc: "Some time after sending my offer to the captain, I have received confirmation from my agents that the guard of Bozîsha-Dâr will be supporting me in my plot against he Kralyi. [guard_leader.GetTitledFirstName] has provent to be a reasonable man and I am certain that he will prove a useful ally in the near future. \n\nBy the will of Khäz-gramaze, my power becomes ever greater in the shadows of [ray|e]. With the guard now loyal to me, I can start to truly prepare the realm for a great coup and purge of the weak and aged Solar Dynasty. Soon, all the lands of the [bayoftulwang|E] will enter into a new age and I will be its great herald in the name of the Shadow."

Trade is the lifeblood of [ray|e] and my domain is in the perfect position to wound it. All it would take would be for me to hire a few hundred loyal men to act as thugs and bandits to both extract a far greater toll on merchants and ruin any hope of the Kralyi taking a cut of the profits \n\nHowever, I must still be careful. If my plot were to come to light, it would at the very least bring great shame to me and would lead to the whole realm seeking to keep an eye on me. If such a thing were to happen, my plan of taking over Rây very well could be compromised."

I will be able to quickly start filling my coffers to pay for the great costs that will come with making foreign allies. \n\nIn addition to the power that comes from these additional funds, my acts have also contributed to reducing the legitimacy of the Kralyi as well as greatly reduce the taxes he extracted from the great trade routes of [ray|e]. Though the rampant crime in my lands may give me somewhat of a bad name, the profits of the venture more than make up for the fallback as long as no one learns of my involvement."

Needless to say, he is greatly displeased by my behaviour and has demanded that that I pay great reparations or face charges of treason. \n\nWhile I may not be ready to enact Khäz-gramaze's will and take [ray|e] in his name, the cost of the reparations would ruin my economy and greatly set back my efforts. If I were to rebel against the Kralyi now, it would surely mean a civil war and while I do not doubt that the Lord of Night would grant me victory it would be hard fought indeed."

Indeed, he has been caught hiring petty thugs and bandits to harass the merchants that cross through his domain while it was his duty to protect them. \n\nThese crimes are grounds to accuse that criminal of treason but such an act would be sure to bring about a bloody and unnecessary civil war. After initial talks, it seems that Mardat would be willing to pay great reparations and take full blame for his acts as long as he receives an official pardon for his crimes."
