  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0101.t: "Zajantak Restored"
  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0101.desc: "Long have the forests stood apart from the wars in the hills and coasts. But we paid for that aloofness with the enthrallment of our own kin to the south. And we diminished, as is the way of things. But now there is a lord upon the throne of the Zajantak, and we are once again strong.\n\nMy people rejoice in their newfound strength, but we are not fools. The Thôn an-Khârlôkh has always taken some interest in the kinsmen of their slaves, and seeing us strong must have them wrathful.\n\nNow we come to a great juncture - this may well be the great battle of our time, and though we may win or lose, songs will be sung through the forests by the very birds and apes themselves, and the great Mûmakil will trumpet the stories of the war to come."
  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0101.a: "We shall remain Zajantak, secure in our power and majesty, the jewel of the Greater Gái."
  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0101.b: "It is time to free our kin from the Stormhost, and destroy them for ever."

  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0102.t: "Zajantak Restored"
  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0102.desc: "A long journey has led me to this throne - I am a stranger in these lands, my people shackled for more years than we can count - and yet I am free, among the northern Gái, and the kingdom of the Zajantak, the birthright of my people, stands strong.\n\nLong have my folk suffered in the south, the slave-thralls of the cruel [adunai|E], as they name themselves, though they permit us call them "Masters" alone. How long have we waited for the day to challenge them? How many stories have we forgotten, and freedoms have we lost, in service to the ever-growing [stormhost|E]? How long have my kinsmen been shackled?\n\n... Is there #italic any #! other choice?"
  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0102.a: "I must bide my time... but I will never forget the crimes of our slavers!"
  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0102.b: "This will be the great war of our time, and we MUST win."
  Zajantak_Host: "Zajaniyîn Warriors"

  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0103.t: "Upstart Kings"
  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0103.desc: "How long has the power of the [adunai|E] stood in the West, in this Bay in the South? We have kept our lands and majesty for a thousand-thousand years upon end, and those who serve us know their place well, or else have been reminded of it time and time again. Was it our folly, then, to let some of their kinsmen stay in the North? Maybe.\n\nNow, those few scattered tribesmen have united! Under [zajantak_king.GetTitledFirstName], our old enemy, the [Glossary('Mîyanâi','miyanai_gloss')] of Zajantak, once crushed by our conquests and great raids, have risen again. We cannot bear this new power in the south to stand. \n\nToo long have we been merciful to the [zajantak_king.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip] and their kindred! We will teach [zajantak_king.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] [zajantak_king.GetHerHis] place. The simple tribesmen of Zajantak cannot stand against the might of the [adunai|E]. We shall shatter this insolent upstart realm for good."
  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0103.a: "What power have mewling slaves against the hosts of the Adûnâim?"
  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0103.b: "We must strike first, and soon, and keep these thralls in their place."

  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0104.t: "A New Hope"
  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0104.desc: "We have, for long years past our count, lived as thralls and slaves to our Masters, the Lords of the West. What other life was there? Under the [stormhost_emperor.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip], the [GetPlayer.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip] were made to be used and pressed into service. Little else did we know, and all our tales were forgotten.\n\nSave for one... the People of the Forest, our free brethren to the north. They passed into history long ago, and for many years we have not heard tell from that land, though it be not distant from ours. But now whispers spread of Zajantak united, under [zajantak_king.GetTitledFirstName]. And for the first time, walking through the streets of my meager holdings, I see hope in the eyes of the [GetPlayer.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip]. \n\nIs there finally a way to stand against the rule of [stormhost_emperor.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]? Is it possible that we might fight against the insidious strength of the [stormhost_emperor.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip]? But I know that whatever be the case, the realms of Men in the South shall be for ever changed. Still, can I really commit my people to this?"
  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0104.a: "What power have we, slaves as we are, against the might of the [stormhost_emperor.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip]?"
  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0104.b: "There is a King in the Forest again. The jungles sing of retribution!"

  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0200.t: "Destiny"
  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0200.desc: "Now all is ready. The captains and commanders of my kingdom have marshalled our hosts, and spoken many words of war and victory to our soldiers. And yet, in all our armies, from the lowest warrior to the greatest officer, a seed of doubt has been planted in the mind. Who are we to fight against the [adunai|E]? For good reason have they have held the coast for so long, while we hide in the trees like beasts.\n\nBut we cannot back down now, and though there may be doubt there is also resolve! We shall stand against the tyranny of [stormhost_emperor.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] and [stormhost_emperor.GetHerHis] [stormhost_emperor.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip], and though we may depart our homes one last time, and the afterlife may be grey and dull, we will go there willingly. After all, for every one of us sent to [GetPlayer.GetFaith.DevilName], ten of them shall be sent before!"
  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0200.a: "We must take back our ancestral lands from the [stormhost_emperor.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip]."
  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0200.a.tt: "You gain access to the Tandi Liberation [casus_belli|E]"

  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0201.t: "Crushing the Ants"
  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0201.desc: "What was [zajantak_king.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] thinking? Did [zajantak_king.GetSheHe] really believe that [zajantak_king.GetHerHis] primitive savages, armed with crude sticks and clubs, and the imitation-toys of [GetPlayer.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip] children? Fools from the jungle will remain fools if you press swords in their hands and drill them to fight for some idea they barely understand. A kingdom? Ha! They are a pack of mangy mutts barking for their spurned master!\n\nIndeed, we have tamed those [Glossary('Mîyanâi','miyanai_gloss')] under our rule, and they are the better for it. Now, let us yoke their wilder kin under our steady hands also, and show them what it truly means to be masters of the south. Zajantak will fall. The #bold Storm #! is rising!"
  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0201.a: "Let us show them the might of the [GetPlayer.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip]."

  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0202.t: "Victory for Now"
  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0202.desc: "How many wars have we fought against [stormhost_emperor.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] and [stormhost_emperor.GetHerHis] [stormhost_emperor.GetPrimaryTitle.GetNameNoTooltip]? Many of my folk have paid dearly, with their blood and their lives, and yet we have seen the dawn time and time again. And now, I have heard that there are no more of our people under the rule of the Stormhost. We have paid dearly, but we have beaten the [stormhost_emperor.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip], and shown all of the Bay that they are not invincible, as they make themselves out to be. Still, they are greedy, and their hands may turn to other necks.\n\nWe have won for a little while, at least. But should they come for our kin again, our swords shall be there, ready to spill [adunai|E] blood!"
  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0202.a: "Should the Stormhost return, we shall be ready!"

  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0203.t: "One of Many"
  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0203.desc: "How have I let the situation in the Stormhost get to this point? I am the scion of Dulgu the Black, heir to an ancient and vicious power, chosen of Zigûr himself! But as I look over our map, I see well that we have lost all the land of the Greater Gái to these #bold [Glossary('Mîyanâi','miyanai_gloss')] #!\n\nLittle love will I ever bear for that people, and so will my heirs. We must strike soon, and crush them once more - the Stormhost never rests, and we shall not bow or yield to mud-born striplings! But I have a greater problem - my own vassals now whisper, their fear of me giving way to disgust and hatred. I shall have to put my own house into order first - then we shall return to the jungle and burn out the dogs."
  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0203.a: "I cannot anger my lessers further, though they be under my rule."
  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0203.b: "Fear is a power I shall use!"

  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0204.t: "Land of the Tandi"
  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0204.desc.new: "After shedding much blood across hill and jungle and coast, my [GetPlayer.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip] have prevailed against the [adunai|E]. Those who tried to stop the swords of the [GetPlayer.GetCulture.GetHeritage.GetNameNoTooltip] have been tossed back into the sea from whence they came. [GetTitleByKey('k_an_balkumagan').GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] has been declared - the forest of the coasts, the southernmost realm of the [GetPlayer.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip] and their kinsmen.\n\nAs I set out to another day of re-ordering my realm, as we heal from the righteous wars we have waged, [chancellor.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] comes up to me. "Grateful are the Tandi, your sundered brethren, oh [GetPlayer.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip]. But many of them desire more than freedom - they wish for a kingdom of their own." A bold proposal, I think as I ponder over the idea, but maybe it would be for the better. Who would I choose, if I wished for the Tandi to rule themselves? I begin to think..."
  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0204.desc: "Though the candidates that first spring to mind are not wholly unappealing to me, I know there are better vassals and kinsmen of mine that I might raise to this high post. I keep thinking, and more names come to me..."
  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0204.a: "Raise [guy1.GetFirstName] to the kingship of [GetTitleByKey('k_an_balkumagan').GetNameNoTierNoTooltip]!"

  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0205.desc: "We meet [antakwelai_king.GetTitledFirstName] in the old tower of [GetTitleByKey('c_tariketh_an_kharat').GetNameNoTierNoTooltip]. Once built and abandoned by the [adunai|E], [antakwelai_king.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip] laborers (alongside not a few of the [blacklock|E] dwarves from [GetTitleByKey('k_barazimab_ul').GetNameNoTierNoTooltip]) are already hard at work repairing the masonry and woodwork that they can. But I did not come here to admire architecture.\n\n[antakwelai_king.GetTitledFirstName] asks me: "How shall we go from here, we two kings of the forest, and our two folk?" I pause to think... what will [GetTitleByKey('k_an_balkumagan').GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] be like to [GetTitleByKey('k_zajantak').GetNameNoTierNoTooltip]?"

  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0300.t: "A Storm over the Forest"
  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0300.desc: "The time has come for the [GetPlayer.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip] of the Stormhost to put down these [Glossary('Mîyanâi','miyanai_gloss')] with dreams of glory and greatness, wearing the trappings of royalty and civlization. There is only one civilized people in the South, and they are under Zigûr, and they are ruled by the Storm-King.\n\nYea, but we shall show these thralls their place, and bring them under our rule once more. A great Storm has gathered, and the lightning it throws shall burn down the Forest!"

  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0301.t: "The Fall of Zajantak"
  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0301.desc: "The Kingdom of the Forest has fallen - we have taken some portion of its people as slaves. The former ruler and his vassals, once playing as nobles, have let their thin veneer of unity fall to pieces as they squabble over the ruins of their little lordship - they have been reduced to savages in the wake of our wrath. Now the whole South knows that [GetPlayer.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip] rule, from the shores of the bay to the forest. But we have not stopped yet.\n\nWe have been preparing for many years..."

  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0302.desc: "Our forest home sings a sorrowful song as she sees her sons carted back in wains and biers, and often not at all. Though we sent out our full force to stop the [stormhost_emperor.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip] swords and their rapacious wielders, we failed in our task, and our forest now lays despoiled, and our hearts are heavy.\n\nMy vassals quarrel, with me and themselves, and I have seen them break off all too easily with the crushing victory of the Stormhost. I am powerless to stop the baying wind and the roiling cloud. We have surrendered ourselves before the Storm."
  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0302.a: "There is no longer a King in the Forest - [GetPlayer.GetSheHe] has lost [GetPlayer.GetHerHis] crown."
