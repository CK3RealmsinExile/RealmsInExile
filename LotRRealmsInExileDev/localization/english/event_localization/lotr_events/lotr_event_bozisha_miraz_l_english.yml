And we diminished, as is the way of things. But now there is a lord upon the throne of the Zajantak, and we are once again strong.\n\nMy people rejoice in their newfound strength, but we are not fools. The Thôn an-Khârlôkh has always taken some interest in the kinsmen of their slaves, and seeing us strong must have them wrathful.\n\nNow we come to a great juncture - this may well be the great battle of our time, and though we may win or lose, songs will be sung through the forests by the very birds and apes themselves, and the great Mûmakil will trumpet the stories of the war to come."

How long have we waited for the day to challenge them? How many stories have we forgotten, and freedoms have we lost, in service to the ever-growing [stormhost|E]?

Was it our folly, then, to let some of their kinsmen stay in the North? Maybe.\n\nNow, those few scattered tribesmen have united! Under [zajantak_king.GetTitledFirstName], our old enemy, the [Glossary('Mîyanâi','miyanai_gloss')] of Zajantak, once crushed by our conquests and great raids, have risen again.

  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0313.desc: "As I awaited the reply of the Storm-Marshal, I worried that he would not prove reasonable and I was right to worry. In what can only be desrcibed as madness, the Marshal has refused my generous alliance terms on the grounds that I was no more than an insignificant barabarian. Though I was shocked by this reply at first, it dawned of me the I had wrongly interpreted the will of Khäz-gramaze. \n\nA people corrupted by the vile touch and worship of Maliciam can never know redemption! It is all so clear to me now. Not only must I purge [ray|e] of non believers and destroy the hated [bellakar|e], I must also conquer and subdue the Anbalûkkhôri. They have always been enemies of Rây and the faithful peoples of [harad|e] and must be destroyed like the monsters they are!"
