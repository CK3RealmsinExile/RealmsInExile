And we diminished, as is the way of things. But now there is a lord upon the throne of the Zajantak, and we are once again strong.\n\nMy people rejoice in their newfound strength, but we are not fools. The Thôn an-Khârlôkh has always taken some interest in the kinsmen of their slaves, and seeing us strong must have them wrathful.\n\nNow we come to a great juncture - this may well be the great battle of our time, and though we may win or lose, songs will be sung through the forests by the very birds and apes themselves, and the great Mûmakil will trumpet the stories of the war to come."

How long have we waited for the day to challenge them? How many stories have we forgotten, and freedoms have we lost, in service to the ever-growing [stormhost|E]?

We have kept our lands and majesty for a thousand-thousand years upon end, and those who serve us know their place well, or else have been reminded of it time and time again. Was it our folly, then, to let some of their kinsmen stay in the North? Maybe.\n\nNow, those few scattered tribesmen have united! Under [zajantak_king.GetTitledFirstName], our old enemy, the [Glossary('Mîyanâi','miyanai_gloss')] of Zajantak, once crushed by our conquests and great raids, have risen again.

[defender.GetTitledFirstName] has sworn that [defender.GetSheHe] would not end this war until he had utterly destroyed the Khäz-gramaze in [GetTitleByKey('k_ray').GetNameNoTier], no matter the cost. \n\nThough I know my victory assured thanks to the favour of Khäz-gramaze, I do worry that the coming war will be a hard won one. Together, the rebels far outnumber my own loyal forces, though a soldier of the true faith can surely defeat many mere heretic in battle."

  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0532.desc: "How? How! How?! I cannot lose! I am the chosen of Khäz-gramaze, the bringer of divine shadow to [harad|e]! This is impossible! Impossible! How could you have wished for this, oh great Khäz-gramaze? How! I had won. [ray|e] was mine, it was defensless, it was ripe for a glorious purge and a renewal under Khäz-gramaze. How could the blind and pitiful fools who could not see beyong their lesser gods have bested me! \n\nI will kill them all! I swear it! All these rebels, every last accursed heretic and heathen, I will slaugther them! They who have dared put me in chains will learn of my might! I will break them, torture them, enjoy every last one of their screams as their life leaves their body, humiliated and doomed to eternal suffering!"
  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0532.a: "Die, die, DIE!"

  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0533.desc: "The war is over, and I have won. As [attacker.GetTitledFirstName] is brought in chains before me I order my men to prepare themselves for the coming celebrations. At long last, the vile heretics of [ray|e] have been destroyed! Their leaders now rot in my dungeon, awaiting the day of their public and sure to be painful execution. Though a few petty lords may remain scattered across the realm, enforcing my rule is now only a matter of cleaning up the last pockets of resistance. \n\nNone in [GetTitleByKey('k_ray').GetNameNoTier] now dare challenge my rule. Soon, my men will be sent across the realm, striking into the now defensless heretic rebel hideouts and slaughtering any who hide inside. My allies have gathered at [GetTitleByKey('c_bozisha_dar').GetNameNoTier] and already they talk of proclaiming a new great dynasty of [GetTitleByKey('k_ray').GetNameNoTier], one under the divine shadow of Khäz-gramaze."
  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0533.a: "Let the celebrations begin with bloodshed!"

  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0534.desc.vatra: "Finally, after so much loss and pain, the divine land of [ray|e] once more belongs to the Vâtrans. The Khäz-gramaze order now lies broken and undone, their usurping leaders locked away in my dungeon. The long dusk of the purge is, at last, over. The sun now rises on a second dawn, for it is clear now that it will be me and my kin that shall be the replacers of the Kanivâtra as the chosen house of Vâtra. \n\nAs the preparations for my coronation as Kralyi begin, I must still make a decisive choice before this is truly over. [defender.GetTitledFirstName], at long last overthrown, is now kept securely in my dungeons. Many call for his execution, as punishement for his treason against the Kanivâtra and for his crimes against the people of the realm. Yet, there are some that believe that sparing [defender.GetTitledFirstName] would aid the normalization of the situation within [GetTitleByKey('k_ray').GetNameNoTier]."
  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0534.desc.ray: "Centuries of opression and decline have lead me to this point. At long last, [ray|e] is free. Free from Vâtra the destroyer, free from Khäz-gramaze the lord of shadow. The Kât-Polozây have endured much, too much, but through pain and sorrow we have rebuilt ourselves anew, and for the first time in untold generations we are ascendent. Already, there are many among the common people that have taken to calling me after Iunást, likening my overthrow of [defender.GetTitledFirstName] to that of Vâtra in the [legend_of_iunast|E]. \n\nBefore a new order can come to [GetTitleByKey('k_ray').GetNameNoTier], however, one final choice must be made. [defender.GetTitledFirstName], the bloody tyrant that ordered and commanded the purges, the madman who led the Khäz-gramaze fanatics, must now have [defender.GetHerHis] fate decided. Many among the people cry out for [defender.GetHerHis] execution, a more than deserved punishement for [defender.GetHerHis] crimes, yet some among my allies call for restraint to facilitate the return to normalcy within the realm."
  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0534.a: "[defender.GetTitledFirstName] will die so that [GetTitleByKey('k_ray').GetNameNoTier] may live!"

  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0535.desc: "I have lost, [ray|e] has lost. No matter how great the rebel coalition, no matter how hard or how desperately we fought, we were defeated by [defender.GetTitledFirstName]'s armies. The army of shadow marched deep into our lands, our bonds built out of desperation broken into pieces in the face of overwhelming Khäz-gramaze power. None now remain that could defend the common people of the realm. Be they Vâtran or Kât-Polozây, all will share the same sorrows, the same pain and the same doom. \n\nFor now, I rot in the dungeons of [GetTitleByKey('c_bozisha_dar').GetNameNoTier], awaiting the coming day of my execution. I am lucky enough to be the first to die, but I know my captor. My death will be painful, so horribly painful..."

  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0536.desc: "After so much suffering, peace has, at long last, returned to [ray|e]. The Khäz-gramaze, leaderless, demoralized and, for many, only loyal to faith for the power or safety it gave them, have begun abandoning the faith on mass. For the vast majority of them, they turn to authority, to me, when chosing what faith to follow. These many new converts are sure to bring my rule a stability and unity long unseen in [GetTitleByKey('k_ray').GetNameNoTier] as the realm is united in faith for the first time in centuries. \n\nHowever, a few pockets of truly fanatical Khäz-gramaze do remain, scattered across the realm awaiting any opportunity to cause trouble or to launch some doomed attempt at reconquest. The return of peace also does not mean the return of prosperity. The land is still ravaged, the purges having left untold destruction in their wake. It will be many long years until [GetTitleByKey('k_ray').GetNameNoTier] is more than a shadow of what it once was, but the road to our renewal is clear."
  lotr_bozisha_miraz.0536.a: "Now comes the time for careful rest."
