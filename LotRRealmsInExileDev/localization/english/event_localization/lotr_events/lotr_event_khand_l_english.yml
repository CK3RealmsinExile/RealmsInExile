 khand.0001.desc.male: "Since the first unification of Khand at the hands of Ôvatha I, the name has held great prestige and importance in the land. Ever after, other rulers who have unified the land have taken the name for their own.\n\nNow I too stand as the supreme master of Khand, and the choice lies before me - shall I assume the name of Ôvatha?"

Ever after, other rulers who have unified the land have taken the name for their own.\n\nNow I too stand as the supreme master of Khand, but the name Ôvatha is that of a man, not a woman - but perhaps its female equivalent, Ôvaizha, could one day become as revered?"

 khand.0100.t: "The Introduction of [heir.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]"
 khand.0100.desc: "My ascension to the throne was earned with sweat and blood, but just as much with diplomacy and negotiation. The meritocratic tradition of my people means that only one who has proven their honor, capability, and skill can hope to maintain the loyalty of the clans and ensure their fealty into the next generation.\n\n[heir.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] must prove [heir.GetHerHim]self to the clans, and so [heir.GetSheHe] will be tested in a grueling event, a free-for-all where my vassals shall have free reign to challenge and question [heir.GetHerHim]. If successful, this will win [heir.GetHerHim] great renown and respect, as it will prove [heir.GetHerHis] skill and ability beyond any proclamation I can make.\n\nThe relationships forged and respect won through this great event will be the foundation with which [heir.GetSheHe] shall begin laying the foundation of [heir.GetHerHis] own rule. But if [heir.GetSheHe] is not ready, this event may instead just imperil [heir.GetHerHis] rule - better no impression at all than a weak or poor one. With that in mind..."

They are in dispute over an agreement that they made some years ago. I have spent quite some time crafting my verdict, and was ready to give it when I was summoned for this event. With that in mind, I thought to put it to you - if you are one day to rule us, I think it fair to know if you can judge fairly."\n\nOn the surface, the case seems relatively straight-forward... if it was in my own territory, anyway.
