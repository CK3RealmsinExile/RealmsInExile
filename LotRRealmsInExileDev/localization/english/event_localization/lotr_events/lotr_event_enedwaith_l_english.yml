 enedwaith.0200.t:0 "Saralain Reborn?"
 enedwaith.0200.desc:0 "[saralain_claimer.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] has claimed for [saralain_claimer.GetHerselfHimself] the title of 'King of Saralain'. Though it long decayed and was finally destroyed, the people of Saralain have remained, and now it would appear that [saralain_claimer.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] plans to see them reunited under [saralain_claimer.GetHersHis] banner. \n\nAs a powerful leader of the Saralain clans, should I suppose this claimant to the fallen kingship, [saralain_claimer.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]?" 
 enedwaith.0200.a:0 "[saralain_claimer.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], my [saralain_claimer.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip], I swear myself to your banner!"
 enedwaith.0200.b:0 "[saralain_claimer.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] is but yet another in a long line of weak claimants..."
 enedwaith.0200.c:0 "I should be king, not [saralain_claimer.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]!"
 
 enedwaith.0300.t:0 "A Blade in the Night"
 enedwaith.0300.desc:0 "My halls are quiet, with only the dim light from candles to provide me with any real vision as I move towards my bedchamber. The guard typically in front of my door is absent, though that isn't an uncommon occurrence. Just as I am about to get into bed though, I notice a shadow coming in through my window. By the time he's actually in the room though I have already stood up and taken up a sword. \n\nWhat kind of idiot would have the audacity to come for me? I watch him pull out a knife and approach me. He must think I'm all bark ad no bite. Well can come as close as he'd like. This intruder will learn the hardway what happens when you piss off a Mad Dog."
 enedwaith.0300.a:0 "You really think you can kill ME?"
 
 enedwaith.0301.t:0 "Flying into a Rage"
 enedwaith.0301.desc:0 "There's blood on my face, though fortunately it is not my own. I watch as a pool of blood grows around the body of the would-be assassin that thought he could put down the Mad Dog. While the scoundrel might be dead, I can only feel the anger swell in my chest. Someone had sent this man for me, and that someone was still out there. \n\nI can feel my heart racing and a vein about to burst in my forehead. Someone tried to kill me. \n\nI would just have to kill them first. \n\nThere were two obvious suspects. My brother Shamis, the Snake, and Berddig the Weasel. Cowardly, disloyal folk they were absolutely the types to try something like this. It might be one of them or it might be both of them. So the only way to find out was to put them both down. "
 enedwaith.0301.a:0 "When I get my hands on those treacherous snakes they'll know suffering!"
 enedwaith.0301.b:0 "I can be patient, and strike them when I'm ready"
 
 enedwaith.0302.t:0 "The Traitor Revealed"
 enedwaith.0302.desc:0 "With the Weasel and the Snake in my dungeon, I look forward to the hours of torture of them and their comrades. Yet after days the screams grow boring, and I have no confession. Only a constant insistence that it wasn't either of them, it was Colan. If they had chosen any other name it likely would have fallen on deaf ears. But they picked exactly the right person to pin the blame on. \n\nIf it wasn't one of these two, then it had to be him. The Snake and the Weasel surely would have broken a while ago, meaning that for once in his life they were telling me the truth. /n/nThe rage begins to build in my chest again as I remember the days of my youth with that man. He had been right to flee south from me, I would have let him live in peace. But he couldn't leave things alone could he? If that bastard is still alive, he'll quickly learn that his days are numbered. \n\nFor now though, the other clans tremble in fear for what I have done to do the Weasel and the Snake. There will never be a better time to bring them into the fold."
 enedwaith.0302.a:0 "I'm coming for you Colan. You cannot hide from me!"
 enedwaith.0302.b:0 "Argh, I wanted to get my hands on the bastard!"
 
 enedwaith.0303.t:0 "The Mad Dog Commands us to Kneel"
 enedwaith.0303.desc:0 "When word reached my ears of an attempted assassination on King Madogh, I almost felt sorry for the poor souls that were to be the target of the Mad Dog's rage. Uet now I have learned that not only were the clans he made war on innocent of the crime, he is demanding all clans bend the knee to him so they might help him in his quest for revenge against the true culprit. \n\nIf I were to refuse, I would no doubt bring his rage upon me. It would be a humiliating outcome sure, but perhaps if our people need to be unified in this day and age?"
 enedwaith.0303.a:0 "We shall submit to the Mad Dog, lest he turn his rage upon us"
 enedwaith.0303.b:0 "We would never kneel before a Mad Dog"
