###   Restore the Iron Crown of Angmar
 forodwaith.0001.t:0 "The Heir of [GetTitleByKey('k_angmar').GetNameNoTier]"
 forodwaith.0001.desc:0 "Long-fallen [GetTitleByKey('k_angmar').GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] rises anew. For centuries, the wastes of the north lay uninhabited, the ruins of the long-lost realm of [GetTitleByKey('k_angmar').GetNameNoTierNoTooltip]. Once, it was among the greatest and mightiest realms of Middle-Earth under [witch_king.GetFirstNameNicknamed] of [GetTitleByKey('k_angmar').GetNameNoTierNoTooltip]. It laid waste to [GetTitleByKey('k_angmar').GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] and its successor states, destroying that wretched kingdom of the [dunedain|e] and striking fear into the hearts of men. Yet it too would fall against a combined onslaught of [men|e] and [elves|e] which would leave the region utterly uninhabited.\n\nYet no more! Under my rule, the Realm of [GetTitleByKey('k_angmar').GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] rises again. The northern wastes and ruins of the former kingdom have been resettled, and it is in my name that the memory of the Iron Crown of [GetTitleByKey('k_angmar').GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] is renewed."
 forodwaith.0001.a:0 "Let the north tremble, for I am the heir of the Iron Crown!"
