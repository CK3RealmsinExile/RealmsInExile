###   Restore the Iron Crown of Angmar
 forodwaith.0001.t:0 "The Heir of Angmar"
 forodwaith.0001.desc:0 "Long-fallen Angmar rises anew. For centuries, the wastes of the north lay uninhabited, the ruins of the long-lost realm of Angmar. Once, it was among the greatest and mightiest realms of Middle-Earth under the Witch-King of Angmar. It laid waste to Arnor and its successor states, destroying that wretched kingdom of the Dúnedain and striking fear into the hearts of men. Yet it too would fall against a combined onslaught of Men and Elves which would leave the region utterly uninhabited.\n\nYet no more! Under my rule, the Realm of Angmar rises again. The northern wastes and ruins of the former kingdom have been resettled, and it is in my name that the memory of the Iron Crown of Angmar is renewed."
 forodwaith.0001.a:0 "Let the north tremble, for I am the heir of the Iron Crown!"
