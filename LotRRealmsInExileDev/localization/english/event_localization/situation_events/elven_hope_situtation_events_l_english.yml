 elven_hope.0001.desc: "#TOLKIENQUOTE: “I have seen three ages in the West of the world, and many defeats, and many fruitless victories.” #!\n\nThe [elves|E] have long dwelt in [middleearth|E]. From their awakening at [cuivienen|E] to the present day, they have born witness to countless triumphs, and innumerable failures. Ever more do they grapple with the course of the world, for the [elderdays|E] are passing, and their strength wanes. Many of their number have begun to consider departing to the undying lands of [valinor|E] beyond the sea.\n\nYet not all hold that the Dominion of [men|E] is inevitable; many still love Middle-earth fiercely, in all its beauty and terrors. When this [age|E] finally passes, what shall come of the Elves? Shall they accept the Doom long-foreseen, or defy it, seeking still to make a home in Middle-earth, fair and free?"

A quiet yearning stirs in the hearts of my people. They speak of the sea not with fear, but with reverence. Some begin to dream of ships, white sails, and far green lands glimpsed only in sleep.\n\nI walk among the trees and see it in their eyes: the light of memory and the ache of something lost. They linger by the rivers, gazing west with wistful silence. Craftsmen fashion tokens shaped like waves or gulls; minstrels pluck melodies that echo the rhythm of the tide. There is a shift in the spirit of the realm, as if the sea calls to us in earnest.\n\nBut I must ask myself: what shall I do with this tide of longing? Will I speak of hope and purpose here in [middleearth|E]? Or shall I prepare the harbors for ships to sail beneath the stars?"

 elven_hope.0101.desc: "There is a stillness in the woods that I cannot ignore. The birds all seem to have fallen silent, and the breeze no longer dances through the branches with its old lightness. The trees themselves seem withdrawn; not dead, but hushed, as if listening for something that no longer comes. I walk beneath their boughs and feel the weight of silence pressing down upon me.\n\nI remember when the leaves would rustle like laughter and the forest would hum with life. Now, even the oldest groves stand motionless. My people speak of it only in whispers. Some believe it is sorrow, others say it is fear. But whatever the cause, it is not natural. Something has changed, and the land feels weary.\n\nIf the earth itself begins to lose its voice, what [hope|E] remains for those of us who dwell in it? I must decide whether to rouse my people with new songs, or to listen, as the trees do, and try to understand what silence seeks to tell us."

 elven_hope.0102.desc: "Today, the air feels warmer, the light softer, and in my halls, laughter rings out like a song. A child has been born among us. An elven child. So rare is such a birth that many among us cannot recall the last time this happened. It is as if the world, long subdued beneath sorrow, has exhaled in joy.\n\nI gaze upon the babe, so small and new, and yet bound to an ancient line that stretches back through Ages. For a moment, I feel no burden, no weight of years; only wonder. Songs echo through the trees, and my people gather, not to mourn the past but to celebrate the future. There is something sacred in this; not just life, but renewal. A quiet defiance of despair.\n\nHope does not always come with trumpets or triumph. Sometimes, it comes wrapped in linen, with starlight in its eyes."
 elven_hope.0102.a: "What hopeful news! A great blessing indeed."
 elven_hope.0102.b: "Let mother and child rest. Well done, [new_mother.GetFirstName]."

 elven_hope.0103.t: "A Nightly Departure"
 elven_hope.0103.desc: "The hour is late, and yet I find myself pulled from my rest. A courtier comes, pale and breathless, whispering of movement by the shore. I follow in silence, heart tight with unspoken knowing. There, beneath the veiled stars, a ship rocks gently in the harbor, its deck already laden with figures cloaked in moonlight. They are [elves|E] of my realm, preparing to depart without farewell.\n\nI step forward, and a hush falls over them. One turns to face me: an elder whose counsel once shaped our songs, now silent. His eyes are filled not with sorrow, but with peace. I ask no questions. I know the answers. Weariness, longing, the call of the sea; it has claimed them. They bow low, and I return the gesture, though my heart cries out like gulls soaring overhead.\n\nAt length, I look towards the ship, offering one last word of advice to those who can no longer be held by these shores."
 elven_hope.0103.a: "May you find the Straight Road without issue."

 elven_hope.0104.t: "The Lay of Kin Long Lost"
 elven_hope.0104.desc: "It begins with a hush. Not one of fear, but of reverence. [elder_courtier.GetFirstName], my [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMeShort', SCOPE.sC('elder_courtier'))], stands before us, [elder_courtier.GetHerHis] voice low and steady, summoning words not spoken aloud for an [age|E]. The song is older than any child of the younger years, drawn from the grief and glory of [beleriand|E]. Names long vanished from our scrolls bloom again in melody, and the hall grows still as stone.\n\nI feel it stir within me; the pull of memory, the ache of loss that transcends lifetimes. Faces of those I once loved rise unbidden, their laughter hidden in the chords of the lay. Though I know these moments are long past, for the span of that song, I dwell among them once more. The Firstborn, proud and radiant. The world as it was before its breaking.\n\nWhen the final note fades, silence holds us captive. Then a breath, one after another, and the room exhales. I see tears in the eyes of those who still remember, and wonder in those who do not. Hope does not always come as a banner or a sword. Sometimes, it is a song that reminds us who we are."
 elven_hope.0104.a: "Great were our deeds of the past."

 elven_hope.0105.t: "A World Marred by Evil"
 elven_hope.0105.desc: "Whispers reach me long before the messengers do. Murmurs of dark tidings; of shadows coiling far from our borders, yet creeping ever closer in the thoughts of my people. The names of places once peaceful now carry the scent of fear, and even the wind seems to hesitate when passing through the trees.\n\nI walk the halls of my residence and see it: the quiet unease behind every smile, the wary glance toward the horizon. [elves|E] who once sang freely now fall silent, their hearts turned to a distant dread. We speak little of it, yet the presence is felt; not just in stories, but in the trembling of leaves that once knew only joy.\n\nThis evil may lie far beyond our own lands, but its weight presses upon us all the same. I know not if it will reach us, or if it will fade like so many storms before it. But in the hearts of my kin, it has already made a mark; one I must strive to heal, before it takes root too deep."
 elven_hope.0105.a: "We are an island in the sea of darkness."

 elven_hope.0106.t: "The Waning of Light"
 elven_hope.0106.desc: "I pass beneath the boughs a particularly ancient tree, as I have done since the early days of my rule. Its leaves, once radiant green even in the fading light of autumn now lie scattered in dull drifts upon the earth: fallen far too soon, far too quietly. The bark is dry to the touch, the song of its spirit dimmed to a brittle whisper. Some among my people say the tree is sick. Others do not speak at all, as if fearing that naming their grief would lend it power.\n\nThe scholars say that such trees do not die as mortal plants do; they wane with the spirit of the land, with the hearts of those who dwell nearby. I kneel at its roots, my hand pressed to the soil, and feel no rot, no worm, no poison. Only silence. It is not just this single tree that suffers. It is we who fade, little by little, from within.\n\nThis tree has stood through ages, through fire and shadow, through joy and sorrow. Yet even it bends now toward slumber. I must decide: will I let it fade quietly, plant anew, or call for those who still remember the hidden ways of renewal? Whatever I choose, I know the tree’s grief is not its own. It is ours."

 elven_hope.0107.desc: "The statue lies in pieces upon the cold stone. I remember it from my earliest years: made of white marble, its surface smooth as starlight, crafted long ago beyond the Sundering Seas. It was said to reflect not the present alone, but memory and meaning, echoing the spirit of the one who gazed upon it. Now, the fragments catch only the pale light of morning, and in them I see nothing but loss.\n\nWhispers spread like frost through the court. Some fear this is a sign; a portent of decay not only in marble, but in us. Others believe it is only an object, and that mourning it gives it more power than it deserves. Yet I cannot help but wonder what force, what moment, could have caused such a thing to break.\n\nI kneel beside the statue's remnants, and my thoughts are heavy. Was this a warning… or an invitation? Is it ruin, or is it renewal?
 elven_hope.0107.a: "Let it be remade. Beauty can still be born anew."

 elven_hope.0108.desc: "Tonight, the halls ring with song. Someone begins a melody I haven’t heard in centuries, and others join in without hesitation; voices twining like silver threads through the air. The hearths blaze bright, casting amber light across long tables and shining eyes. There is dancing, too, and laughter that rises like birds startled into flight.\n\nFor a moment, the weight lifts from our shoulders. The long memory of sorrow, the silence that has haunted these walls, the ache of time: it all fades beneath the stars. I watch as the youngest [elves|E] are pulled into the steps of dances older than the mountains, and I see the light rekindled in the eyes of the eldest among us.\n\nI find myself smiling, unguarded and true. Whatever doom may lie ahead, whatever shadow creeps from afar, we are still here. Still singing. Still dancing. Still alive."

It sings of the depths of the earth, of green frogs and wildflowers.\n\nBut as I make my way towards it once more, I can't recognise it anymore. All I hear is a deathly silence, and when I reach it I understand. The water is fouled by burnt, fallen trees and the decomposing bodies of slaughtered wild animals.

I follow them out, out of my great hall and into the open, and all about me people look eagerly upwards.\n\nI descry a flock of nigh a thousand birds, I guess, their flock dancing and twisting in great movements back and forth. And the wind is fair and cool, and the world quiet save for their joyful song, and their thousand voices rise and fall. So I gaze towards rose-painted heaven, and the sun westers, and it turns gold and fair, and the silver moon peeks its head from the east, and a few faint stars accompany it. Time is forgotten."

No, it is the miserable and wretched gloominess, more dreary than any winter in many years. The heavens are grey and black, and in day and night the clouds reveal glimpse of neither star nor sun.\n\nEvery time I step outside I feel sorrow, for the shadows are long and grey, and the warmth of the sun and the twinkling of the stars feel like distant memories.

Peculiarly, however, it is also dry and windless. There is no alleviating and cool breeze which makes one feel as if they have plunged into a clear lake, nor is there cleansing rain. There has not even been a cloud in the sky for weeks.\n\nThe bushes have dried out, the grass has turned the colour of sand, and leaves abandon trees and reveal bare boughs. Once sweet-sounding streams have turned quiet, leaving bone-dry riverbeds, as have once teeming and deep lakes. Perhaps worst of all, the birds and insects too have gone quiet. They have passed on in search of solace and shade and to quench their thirst, and now there is only still and sweltering quietness."

I hear the faint babble of a stream.\n\nYet my attention is turned to a patch of bare earth, dry and forgotten and quiet, and I feel in my heart some deep pity and sorrow. I observe, and in my mind arises a vision, and I hear the singing of songbirds in spring. What this bare earth could be! What plants and scentful flowers could grow here, and what shrubs could provide shade and solace for the slithering creatures of the earth, if only by some tending and little effort."

Upon a low bough of a short tree I spot the maker of that fair melody, a robin with an effulgent orange breast. Yet that is not all. In the bushes hop tiny little chaffinches and titmice, and butterflies painted blue and red flutter from flower to flower.\n\nI hear the deep ribbit of some frogs, and for a second see them hop from their stream, green as spring grass. Now in the grass below slithers softly a grass snake off on some grand and epic hunt, and scarlet-streaked grasshoppers trill from atop tall and majestic grasses. I cannot help but smile, and gazing upon this one garden I feel the hope of Ages."
 elven_hope.0117.a: "My heart is quieted by joy."

 elven_hope.0118.t: "A Withering Garden"
 elven_hope.0118.desc: "I am passing along some old paths that wind behind my hall, to visit the garden I planted all that time ago. It has been some time since I visited it last, so I had decided now on this fine and warm morning to pay it a visit.\n\nYet as I turn the corner and see it, shock fills my heart. I cannot hear the babbling of the stream anymore, and all the plants and trees that I planted that while ago are drooping over, some having turned almost wholly brown. Fallen dead leaves litter the ground.\n\nThere is no singing of the birds anymore, nor the chirping of crickets and grasshoppers. Only silence. Deep sorrow replaces shock."
 elven_hope.0118.a: "What a shame..."
 elven_hope.0118.b: "I will bring renewed life here!"
 elven_hope.0118.b.success: "You manage to restore the garden"
 elven_hope.0118.b.failure: "Your efforts to restore the garden fail"

 elven_hope.0119.t: "A Burning Tree"
 elven_hope.0119.desc: "I am awoken at night by the pealing of thunder. My guards are visibly startled. I wait for a moment, before I see a flash outside, followed nigh instantly by thunder. That could only mean one thing. I make my way out of the hall to ascertain the situation.\n\nStormclouds roll overhead, but there is no rain. Lightning flashes on the horizon, like a thin finger. I feel a foreboding premonition in my heart. After each flash the sky resounds and shudders, and black clouds swirl above. It is not long before my premonition comes true.\n\nThe sky is separated by a white crack, which ends in flame. It disappears immediately, but the flame does not. A great and ancient tree, one beloved by our people, shudders, and flame has caught on its canopy. Its bough shakes, and sparks fall from it. If it is to be saved, we must act now, though it would be an undoubtedly risky endeavour."
 elven_hope.0119.a: "We cannot risk it."
 elven_hope.0119.b: "Long has this tree stood, long it may yet stand!"
 elven_hope.0119.b.success: "You put out the fire and save the tree"
 elven_hope.0119.b.failure: "You cannot save the tree"

 elven_hope.0120.t: "Paradise Lost"
 elven_hope.0120.desc: "It is dark when I arise, and I hear the crackle of flame, which grows deafening by the time I reach my door. As I throw open the doors I am face to face with orange flame, from which marches a figure black as the Void, emanating malice and hate, black as the Void, speaking in a vile tongue and beckoning me.\n\nI heft my blade and drive it into the dark figure. There is an ear-splitting screech before he fades into nothingness, and all falls silent. Before me is [elven_capital.GetNameNoTier], but as I walk out, and there is no trace of anyone, not in any house or street or watchtower. All is quiet. There is a wicked roar behind me, and before I can react a blade plunges into my heart.\n\nThe grey curtain of the world is rolled back, but as I open my eyes I see around me a fair and green land, and are white shores. Upon an emerald hill stands a mighty city of gleaming pearl and marble and crystal. The horns of Tirion boom, and their sound is fair as a fountain glittering in the light of spring's dawn. Yet as I arise I am jolted from my dream, and it is morning in Middle-Earth."
 elven_hope.0120.a: "How blessed is Tirion, how fair is Aman?"
 elven_hope.0120.b: "No! Middle-Earth is my abode, in sorrow and hope."
 elven_hope.0120.b.success: "Your words are convincing"
 elven_hope.0120.b.failure: "You fail to convince anyone"
 
 elven_hope.0121.t: "A Valorous Sight"
 elven_hope.0121.desc: "As I wander across the markets of [my_capital_county.GetNameNoTier], I come across a few of the sentinels who are engaged in training. I stop and watch for a while, amazed by their sheer prowess and skill at arms on display.\n\nAmong them, [mighty_courtier.GetName] stands out the most, wielding blade and shield in a flurry of movements that take an elf-eye to follow. If this is the might of the [elves|E] in their waning days, how powerful must the lords of the Eldar have been in the Noon of [valinor|E]?\n\nI find solace that even in these later days, such gallant fighters are still to be found among us."
 elven_hope.0121.a: "How comforting it is to see such prowess on display."
 
 elven_hope.0122.t: "An Inspiring Song"
 elven_hope.0122.desc: "In the well-tended gardens of [my_capital_county.GetNameNoTier], singing can be heard. Curiosity draws me closer, and as I arrive at the scene, I spot a few [elves|E] performing one of the songs from the Years of the Trees, when the stars still shone uncontested in the ever-present, gentle night.\n\n[musical_courtier.GetName] takes up the lute and begins to play as the song continues. I find myself standing still, with no thoughts disrupting my listening experience. When the song ends, I feel my heart lightened, and find that my sorrows have been lessened, for a while."
 elven_hope.0122.a: "We should sing such songs more often."
 
 elven_hope.0123.t: "Impressions in Paint"
 elven_hope.0123.desc: "As I retire from my court and walk towards my private chambers, [painting_courtier.GetName] beckons to me, holding a recently finished painting. "This is my gift to you," [painting_courtier.GetSheHe] says, turning the painting around so I can see what is depicted in it.\n\nI behold a green country, nestled between sharply-rising cliffs on both sides, and a rising sun at the horizon. "A masterful work of hand," I say as its maker hands me the painting. "Thank you for this gift."\n\nMy heart is gladdened as I search for a place on the walls to hang the painting. It is little things like this that are worth fighting for in a world that grows chill."
 elven_hope.0123.a: "I will treasure this."
