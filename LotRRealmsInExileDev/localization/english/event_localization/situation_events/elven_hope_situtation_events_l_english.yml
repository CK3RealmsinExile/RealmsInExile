 elven_hope.0001.t: "The Long Defeat"
 elven_hope.0001.desc: "#TOLKIENQUOTE: “I have seen three ages in the West of the world, and many defeats, and many fruitless victories.” #!\n\nThe [elves|E] have long dwelt in [middleearth|E]. From their awakening at [cuivienen|E] to the present day, they have born witness to countless triumphs, and innumerable failures. Ever more do they grapple with the course of the world, for the [elderdays|E] are passing, and their strength wanes. Many of their number have begun to consider departing to the undying lands of [valinor|E] beyond the sea.\n\nYet not all hold that the Dominion of [men|E] is inevitable; many still love Middle-earth fiercely, in all its beauty and terrors. When this [age|E] finally passes, what shall come of the Elves? Shall they accept the Doom long-foreseen, or defy it, seeking still to make a home in Middle-earth, fair and free?"
 elven_hope.0001.a: "May the [valargods|E] guide us."

 elven_hope.0100.t: "Dreams of the Sea"
 elven_hope.0100.desc: "Lately, the wind brings strange longings with it. I find my thoughts adrift, drawn westward to the shores beyond my grasp. And I am not alone in this. A quiet yearning stirs in the hearts of my people. They speak of the sea not with fear, but with reverence. Some begin to dream of ships, white sails, and far green lands glimpsed only in sleep.\n\nI walk among the trees and see it in their eyes: the light of memory and the ache of something lost. They linger by the rivers, gazing west with wistful silence. Craftsmen fashion tokens shaped like waves or gulls; minstrels pluck melodies that echo the rhythm of the tide. There is a shift in the spirit of the realm, as if the sea calls to us in earnest.\n\nBut I must ask myself: what shall I do with this tide of longing? Will I speak of hope and purpose here in [middleearth|E]? Or shall I prepare the harbors for ships to sail beneath the stars?"
 elven_hope.0100.a: "One day, all of us will sail."
 elven_hope.0100.b: "I shall sing a song of hope that is not yet lost."

 elven_hope.0101.t: "The Trees Do Not Sing"
 elven_hope.0101.desc: "There is a stillness in the woods that I cannot ignore. The birds all seem to have fallen silent, and the breeze no longer dances through the branches with its old lightness. The trees themselves seem withdrawn; not dead, but hushed, as if listening for something that no longer comes. I walk beneath their boughs and feel the weight of silence pressing down upon me.\n\nI remember when the leaves would rustle like laughter and the forest would hum with life. Now, even the oldest groves stand motionless. My people speak of it only in whispers. Some believe it is sorrow, others say it is fear. But whatever the cause, it is not natural. Something has changed, and the land feels weary.\n\nIf the earth itself begins to lose its voice, what [hope|E] remains for those of us who dwell in it? I must decide whether to rouse my people with new songs, or to listen, as the trees do, and try to understand what silence seeks to tell us."
 elven_hope.0101.a: "Their songs will return with the changing of the season."
 elven_hope.0101.b: "I must investigate this matter."
 elven_hope.0101.b.success: "You uncover the source of the silence"
 elven_hope.0101.b.failure: "Your search proves to be fruitless"

 elven_hope.0102.t: "The Child of Spring"
 elven_hope.0102.desc: "Today, the air feels warmer, the light softer, and in my halls, laughter rings out like a song. A child has been born among us. An elven child. So rare is such a birth that many among us cannot recall the last time this happened. It is as if the world, long subdued beneath sorrow, has exhaled in joy.\n\nI gaze upon the babe, so small and new, and yet bound to an ancient line that stretches back through Ages. For a moment, I feel no burden, no weight of years; only wonder. Songs echo through the trees, and my people gather, not to mourn the past but to celebrate the future. There is something sacred in this; not just life, but renewal. A quiet defiance of despair.\n\nHope does not always come with trumpets or triumph. Sometimes, it comes wrapped in linen, with starlight in its eyes."
 elven_hope.0102.a: "What hopeful news! A great blessing indeed."
 elven_hope.0102.b: "Let mother and child rest. Well done, [new_mother.GetFirstName]."
 elven_hope.0102.c: "We shall celebrate this joyous event."

 elven_hope.0103.t: "A Nightly Departure"
 elven_hope.0103.desc: "The hour is late, and yet I find myself pulled from my rest. A courtier comes, pale and breathless, whispering of movement by the shore. I follow in silence, heart tight with unspoken knowing. There, beneath the veiled stars, a ship rocks gently in the harbor, its deck already laden with figures cloaked in moonlight. They are [elves|E] of my realm, preparing to depart without farewell.\n\nI step forward, and a hush falls over them. One turns to face me: an elder whose counsel once shaped our songs, now silent. His eyes are filled not with sorrow, but with peace. I ask no questions. I know the answers. Weariness, longing, the call of the sea; it has claimed them. They bow low, and I return the gesture, though my heart cries out like gulls soaring overhead.\n\nAt length, I look towards the ship, offering one last word of advice to those who can no longer be held by these shores."
 elven_hope.0103.a: "May you find the Straight Road without issue."
 elven_hope.0103.b: "Linger here a few short hours longer to allow for a proper farewell."

 elven_hope.0104.t: "The Lay of Kin Long Lost"
 elven_hope.0104.desc: "It begins with a hush. Not one of fear, but of reverence. [elder_courtier.GetFirstName], my [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMeShort', SCOPE.sC('elder_courtier'))], stands before us, [elder_courtier.GetHerHis] voice low and steady, summoning words not spoken aloud for an [age|E]. The song is older than any child of the younger years, drawn from the grief and glory of [beleriand|E]. Names long vanished from our scrolls bloom again in melody, and the hall grows still as stone.\n\nI feel it stir within me; the pull of memory, the ache of loss that transcends lifetimes. Faces of those I once loved rise unbidden, their laughter hidden in the chords of the lay. Though I know these moments are long past, for the span of that song, I dwell among them once more. The Firstborn, proud and radiant. The world as it was before its breaking.\n\nWhen the final note fades, silence holds us captive. Then a breath, one after another, and the room exhales. I see tears in the eyes of those who still remember, and wonder in those who do not. Hope does not always come as a banner or a sword. Sometimes, it is a song that reminds us who we are."
 elven_hope.0104.a: "The deeds of the past are lost to us."
 elven_hope.0104.b: "Let the memory strengthen our resolve."
 elven_hope.0104.c: "I shall arrange for this song to be sung more often."

 elven_hope.0105.t: "A World Marred by Evil"
 elven_hope.0105.desc: "Whispers reach me long before the messengers do. Murmurs of dark tidings; of shadows coiling far from our borders, yet creeping ever closer in the thoughts of my people. The names of places once peaceful now carry the scent of fear, and even the wind seems to hesitate when passing through the trees.\n\nI walk the halls of my residence and see it: the quiet unease behind every smile, the wary glance toward the horizon. [elves|E] who once sang freely now fall silent, their hearts turned to a distant dread. We speak little of it, yet the presence is felt; not just in stories, but in the trembling of leaves that once knew only joy.\n\nThis evil may lie far beyond our own lands, but its weight presses upon us all the same. I know not if it will reach us, or if it will fade like so many storms before it. But in the hearts of my kin, it has already made a mark; one I must strive to heal, before it takes root too deep."
 elven_hope.0105.a: "We are an island in the sea of darkness."
 elven_hope.0105.b: "Even in a world ever-darkening, we have endured."

 elven_hope.0106.t: "The Waning of Light"
 elven_hope.0106.desc: "I pass beneath the boughs a particularly ancient tree, as I have done since the early days of my rule. Its leaves, once radiant green even in the fading light of autumn now lie scattered in dull drifts upon the earth: fallen far too soon, far too quietly. The bark is dry to the touch, the song of its spirit dimmed to a brittle whisper. Some among my people say the tree is sick. Others do not speak at all, as if fearing that naming their grief would lend it power.\n\nThe scholars say that such trees do not die as mortal plants do; they wane with the spirit of the land, with the hearts of those who dwell nearby. I kneel at its roots, my hand pressed to the soil, and feel no rot, no worm, no poison. Only silence. It is not just this single tree that suffers. It is we who fade, little by little, from within.\n\nThis tree has stood through ages, through fire and shadow, through joy and sorrow. Yet even it bends now toward slumber. I must decide: will I let it fade quietly, plant anew, or call for those who still remember the hidden ways of renewal? Whatever I choose, I know the tree’s grief is not its own. It is ours."
 elven_hope.0106.a: "One by one, all things must fade."
 elven_hope.0106.b: "We shall plant new seeds, and tend them with care."
 
 elven_hope.0107.t: "A Shattered Statue"
 elven_hope.0107.desc: "The statue lies in pieces upon the cold stone. I remember it from my earliest years: made of white marble, its surface smooth as starlight, crafted long ago beyond the Sundering Seas. It was said to reflect not the present alone, but memory and meaning, echoing the spirit of the one who gazed upon it. Now, the fragments catch only the pale light of morning, and in them I see nothing but loss.\n\nWhispers spread like frost through the court. Some fear this is a sign; a portent of decay not only in marble, but in us. Others believe it is only an object, and that mourning it gives it more power than it deserves. Yet I cannot help but wonder what force, what moment, could have caused such a thing to break.\n\nI kneel beside the statue's remnants, and my thoughts are heavy. Was this a warning… or an invitation? Is it ruin, or is it renewal?
 elven_hope.0107.a: "Let it be remade. Beauty can still be born anew."
 elven_hope.0107.b: "Its time has passed. Leave the fragments where they fell."
 elven_hope.0107.c: "Distribute the pieces among my people as reminders of our trials."
 
 elven_hope.0108.t: "Merriment Under the Stars"
 elven_hope.0108.desc: "Tonight, the halls ring with song. Someone begins a melody I haven’t heard in centuries, and others join in without hesitation; voices twining like silver threads through the air. The hearths blaze bright, casting amber light across long tables and shining eyes. There is dancing, too, and laughter that rises like birds startled into flight.\n\nFor a moment, the weight lifts from our shoulders. The long memory of sorrow, the silence that has haunted these walls, the ache of time: it all fades beneath the stars. I watch as the youngest [elves|E] are pulled into the steps of dances older than the mountains, and I see the light rekindled in the eyes of the eldest among us.\n\nI find myself smiling, unguarded and true. Whatever doom may lie ahead, whatever shadow creeps from afar, we are still here. Still singing. Still dancing. Still alive."
 elven_hope.0108.a: "Let their merriment continue into the dawn."
 elven_hope.0108.b: "I will join them, and share in the joy."
 elven_hope.0108.c: "We must not forget the work still ahead of us."
 
 elven_hope.0109.t: "A Good Harvest"
 elven_hope.0109.desc: "As I prepare to hold court before the throne, [happy_courtier.GetName] approaches me happily. "The gathering of your realm's bounties has concluded, my liege. We have been blessed with a plentiful harvest this season."\n\nMy heart is gladdened at the news, for good food, drink, and provisions will do much to uplift the spirits of the [elves|E] in my care. It falls to me to decide how best to distribute the harvest now, as I have done many times before."
 elven_hope.0109.a: "Distribute all that is not urgently needed among the populace."
 elven_hope.0109.b: "Let us thank the Lady [yavannacharacter|E] for her blessings."
 elven_hope.0109.c: "The excess goods should go towards trade and commerce."
 
 elven_hope.0110.t: "Colonial Successes"
 elven_hope.0110.desc: "While going for a walk in the glades nearby, [colonist_courtier.GetName] approaches me, bearing a missive. "I bring tidings from [colony_county.GetName], my [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord]. The work goes well, and exceeds our expectations, and they are sure to be finished much sooner than anticipated."\n\nI nod in approval and my heart grows lighter. As my realm expands, [hope|E] is renewed among those who live in it. I must make sure to guide the settlers of [colony_county.GetName] with care, for their industry and endurances shines as a bright light of renewal in times of growing darkness."
 elven_hope.0110.a: "Send them any aid they require."
 elven_hope.0110.b: "Their diligence shall be made known to all."

 elven_hope.0111.t: "A Polluted Stream"
 elven_hope.0111.desc: "I have always enjoyed the song of a particular stream, that runs through [border_county.GetNameNoTier], on the edges of our lands. It sings of the depths of the earth, of green frogs and wildflowers.\n\nBut as I make my way towards it once more, I can't recognise it anymore. All I hear is a deathly silence, and when I reach it I understand. The water is fouled by burnt, fallen trees and the decomposing bodies of slaughtered wild animals. Its banks have been vandalised with a cruelty I can barely conceive. This is truly an [alignment_evil|E] deed."
 elven_hope.0111.a: "With time, the stream will heal."
 elven_hope.0111.b: "We shall restore it to its former self."
 elven_hope.0111.b.success: "The stream sings joyously once again"
elven_hope.0111.b.failure: "The stream will never be the same again"
