 court_ongoing.2001.summer_opening:0 "Today marks the opening of the Festival of Tarnin Austa, the Gates of Summer, when Arien sails Anor close to Middle-Earth and dispels [morgothcharacter|E]'s cold from the lands. We wait eagerly for the coming dawn to sing our welcome to the new season."

 court_ongoing.2001.distant_opening:1 "I have made my way to the court in [court_of_residence.GetNameNoTier] in time for the festival at the [court_owner.Custom('ResidenceBuilding')]. I secured an invitation, for I have to see [target.GetTitledFirstName]."
 court_ongoing.2001.close_opening:1 "I am attending the festival not simply because I am the [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|U] of the [court_owner.Custom('ResidenceBuilding')], but because I want to see [target.GetTitledFirstName] there."
 court_ongoing.2001.desc:1 "\n\n[target.GetSheHe|U] looks resplendent. As the music starts, signaling the first dance, my gaze meets [target.GetHersHis] and soon our hands meet and we dance with abandon, oblivious to our surroundings.\n\nWhen the music subsides and when we finally have a quiet moment, I offer my suggestion."
 court_ongoing.2001.a:0 "With you, I could dance all night, my [target.GetLadyLord]."

 court_ongoing.2001.b.tt:0 "#F Appeal to [target.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] thoughtful side.#!"
 court_ongoing.2001.c:0 "Shall we sit by the fire, and hear the bard's tale?"

 court_ongoing.2003.story:0 "\n\nWe went to listen to the bard's tales, and we sat listening together for most of the night. It was captivating!"
 court_ongoing.2003.fallback:0 "\n\nWe ended up having so much fun, we danced almost the entire duration of the celebration!"
 court_ongoing.2003.a:0 "I had such a good evening!"

 court_ongoing.2004.dance:0 "[owner.GetSheHe|U] failed to take the hint that I was not interested in dancing, and after a few reluctant spins I had to ask [owner.GetHerHim] to let me go."
 court_ongoing.2004.walk:0 "While a walk in the garden was bracing, [owner.GetFirstNamePossessive] chatter bored me immensely.\n\nI soon made my excuses, and found my way back to the dance."
 court_ongoing.2004.story:0 "While I was not opposed to [owner.GetHerHis] presence, the entire evening [owner.GetSheHe] wanted to sit and listen to stories. I was quickly bored, and made my excuses to go dancing instead."
 court_ongoing.2004.fallback:0 "[owner.GetSheHe|U] kept suggesting ways of spending time at the celebrations, but there is only so much [owner.GetSheHe] can do when [owner.GetSheHe] is such dreadful company by [owner.GetHerselfHimself]."

 court_ongoing.2005.story:0 "I asked the bard to sing all of [target.GetTitledFirstName]'s favourite stories, and as the evening went by we delighted in every tale that the halls of [court_of_residence.GetNameNoTier] have to offer. That Elf certainly has a taste for romance and adventure."
 court_ongoing.2005.fallback:0 "[target.GetTitledFirstName] and I ended up having so much fun, we danced almost the entire duration of the celebration!"
 court_ongoing.2005.a:0 "What an evening we had!"

 court_ongoing.2006.dance:0 "I thought I was set once [target.GetSheHe] agreed to dance, but even though I handled myself deftly, [target.GetTitledFirstName] soon made some excuses and left me standing by myself among the other dancers."
 court_ongoing.2006.walk:0 "I thought it a pleasant walk, but perhaps it was too cold, or perhaps I spoke too much, for [target.GetSheHe] soon made [target.GetHerHis] excuses and returned to the dance, not even waiting to see if I was coming along.\n\nBy the time I made it back, [target.GetSheHe] was busy having fun with the other dancers."
 court_ongoing.2006.story:0 "Perhaps there was something wrong with the tales I had the bard sing for [target.GetTitledFirstName]? Even after [target.GetSheHe] had made [target.GetHerHis] excuses the stories never ended, as I listened to them alone."
 court_ongoing.2006.fallback:0 "I kept suggesting ways we could spend time at the celebrations, but [target.GetTitledFirstName] seemed completely uninterested. Did I do something wrong?"
 court_ongoing.2006.a:0 "This went poorly."
