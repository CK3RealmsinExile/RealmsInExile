 elven_yearly.0001.desc: "As I stroll down the streets of [capital_province.GetNameNoTooltip], a Noldorin Elf approaches. [gardener_character.GetNameNoTooltip]'s garb is simple and [gardener_character.GetHerHis] hands are stained with dirt.\n\n"My [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip], they call me the Garden Gnome because I share my Sindarin mother's love for all that is green and grows in the earth. Your domain is full works of stone and metal, but would it not be more beautiful if the Aulë and Yavanna worked together?"
 elven_yearly.0001.a: "You are right, please join my court as gardener."
 elven_yearly.0001.b: "Please teach [physician.GetNameNoTooltip] about medicinal herbs."
 elven_yearly.0001.c: "Will you teach me the art of gardening?"
 elven_yearly.0001.c.tooltip_b: "You fail to learn anything"
 elven_yearly.0001.d: "Maybe we should all to a little gardening?"

 elven_yearly.0002.t: "A Bejewelled Garden"
 elven_yearly.0002.desc: "I step into my garden for a break, taking a deep breath and closing my eyes. The sky is blue, and the birds are #italic whistling#!? I open my eyes to see a person in front of me, hand full with shining crystals. He notices me before I can get a word in.\n\n"My [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetLadyLord|U]! I was reading yesterday of the beauty of Tirion, back when the [noldorelves|E] still lived in [aman|E]." [jewel_elf.GetSheHe|U] says cheerfully. "Apparently, in those days, the Noldor scattered jewels and crystals within their gardens! I thought that was brilliant, and perhaps that I could increase the splendour of your own gardens, in the same way!"\n\nHe smiles merrily, though where he got the jewels from I have no idea. The grass around me glimmers."
 elven_yearly.0002.a: "You and your jewels, out!"
 elven_yearly.0002.b: "A wonderful idea! Keep at it!"
 elven_yearly.0002.b.success: "The idea is a hit among your court"
 elven_yearly.0002.b.failure: "People keep stepping on sharp jewels"
 elven_yearly.0002.c: "How nice, I should chip in too!"
 elven_yearly.0002.d: "How about you line my #italic pockets#! with jewels, instead!"
 elven_yearly.0002.e: "It was the in fact the shores and pools that had jewels, #italic not#! the gardens."
