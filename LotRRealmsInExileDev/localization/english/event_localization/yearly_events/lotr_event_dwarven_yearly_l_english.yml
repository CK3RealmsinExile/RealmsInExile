 ### Introduction Events
 dwarven_yearly.0001.t:0 "Hazardous Quaffing"
 dwarven_yearly.0001.desc:0 "I'm enjoying a quiet evening beer when my steward [steward.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] comes to me, a worried look upon [steward.GetHerHis] face.\n\n"My liege, look at how battered and dented our tankards are! You can't quaff properly with these things. Half our guests end up with their clothes ruined after being soaked in alcohol. Something must be done!""
 dwarven_yearly.0001.a:0 "I'll send for the best tankards money can buy!"
 dwarven_yearly.0001.b:0 "I'll commission a local artisan to make new ones."
 dwarven_yearly.0001.c:0 "Why can't they all learn to drink properly?"
 
 dwarven_yearly.0002.t:0 ""A Hunting Rivalry"
 dwarven_yearly.0002.desc:0 "As I am making my way through my halls I take notice of a rather vivid discussion between two of my courtiers seemingly about hunting.. \n\n"My liege, this man here seems so arrogant as to claim that he would best me in a hunting competition which is quite frankly outrageous!""

 dwarven_yearly.0003.t:0 "Grudge-bearer"
 dwarven_yearly.0003.desc:0 "Walking through the halls, I find a small leatherbound book left out on a table. Well-worn, it bears no name, but curiosity compels me to open it.\n\nWithin I find page upon page of writing in a sharp, cramped hand. After taking a moment to puzzle it out, my curiosity turns to befuddlement. Page upon page of minor slights and grievances, some going back years or decades! Accompanying many of them are notes of how to best 'avenge' the author's honor. How to repay someone who ate the last roll, the time and date of someone sitting in a favorite chair, the time a childhood toy was borrowed and returned late - the sheer vehemence of the author to the scale of the 'slights' is unbelievable!\n\nClosing it and placing it down, my brow furrows, before the harsh voice of [dwarven_char.GetName] bellows down the hall, "Have you seen a book around here? It should be small, well-worn, and leatherbound."
 dwarven_yearly.0003.a:0 "Do you mean this book?"
 dwarven_yearly.0003.b:0 "Did you write this, [dwarven_char.GetName]? We must speak!"

 dwarven_yearly.0004.desc:0 "As I study maps of my realm by lamplight, [dwarven_char.GetName] approaches me.\n\n"Sire, a group of miners have uncovered the entrance to a vast cavern system. They feared to explore it further without your leave. What shall be done?"\n\nSuch caverns can contain natural treasures, but also myriad dangers. Sending [dwarven_char.GetName] would avoid personal risk to me, but they would expect a cut of any profits. But if I were to lead the expedition through the cave myself..."

 dwarven_yearly.0005.t:0 "Wandering in the Dark"
 dwarven_yearly.0005.desc:0 "After a long day at court I decide to take a break outside of my halls to clear my mind.\n\nThe old path that I choose leads through cleared tunnels and around glimmering underground streams. I walk until the path disappears into a canyon buried under boulders.\n\nI was about to turn around and leave when I heard a sound from behind the boulders."
 dwarven_yearly.0005.a:0 "What was that? I have to find out."
 dwarven_yearly.0005.b:0 "It's getting late. I have to return to my court." 

 dwarven_yearly.0006.t:0 "A Beautiful Sight"
 dwarven_yearly.0006.desc:0 "Peeking behind the boulders reveals a waterfall which leads into a small hidden cave. Entering it I find an array of shimmering gems. Iridescent crystals, rubies, stalactites and stalagmites glitter and shine, lit by reflections of a central gleaming lake. The sight of the cave with its dancing colors is breathtaking.\n\nI spend the rest of the day in the hidden cave watching and wandering around the lake before I return to do my duties."
 dwarven_yearly.0006.a:0 "Thank you, O Mahal, for such wonders!"

 dwarven_yearly.0007.t:0 "A Dwarf in Need"
 dwarven_yearly.0007.desc:0 "As I walk around the boulders I hear piercing screams of pain coming from around the corner.\n\nWhen I get to the source of the screams I see the remains of the battle that just ended. Bodies of dead goblins lay strewn about, and in the center lies a single dwarf. As I cautiously approach, [dwarven_char.GetName] spots me.\n\n"Please, help me..."\n\nI can try to save [dwarven_char.GetName]... or I can kill [dwarven_char.GetHerHim] and collect all this loot, including a heavy pouch of gokd. If I want to save [dwarven_char.GetName] I must to take [dwarven_char.GetHerHim] to my court and leave everything here as it is."

 dwarven_yearly.0007.b:0 "This gold is MINE!"

 dwarven_yearly.0008.t:0 "Goblins!"
 dwarven_yearly.0008.desc:0 "As I walk between the boulders I distinguish the sound of goblin screeching. I go closer to the source and spot a goblin camp, yet there are not many goblins present. Their screaming is loud but still unintelligible. It looks like they are collecting loot and preparing to leave.\n\nI must kill them here and now, lest they leave while I gather reinforcements."
 dwarven_yearly.0008.a:0 "Die, goblin filth!"

 dwarven_yearly.0008.b:0 "There are too many of them, I must gather reinforcements."

 dwarven_yearly.0009.t:0 "The ‘Knockers"
 dwarven_yearly.0009.desc:0 "Tippy-tap, tippy-tap. My folks are being driven mad by mysterious knocking sounds that appear suddenly and vanish just as fast. Echoes resound through tunnels and shafts, as eerie as they are startling. As yet no source has been discovered, but rumours abound that they are being created by some diminutive species native to the roots of the mountain.\n\nOld men in their cups have begun mumbling about grey-skinned creatures with bulbous heads, whose distracting tapping will soon be followed by the theft of tools… or even children."
 dwarven_yearly.0009.a:0 "Preposterous! I will not be frightened by echoes."
 dwarven_yearly.0009.a.tt:0 "You are too scared to wander into the dark halls"
 dwarven_yearly.0009.b:0 "Send Marshall [marshal.GetNameNoTooltip] to investigate the problem."
 dwarven_yearly.0009.b.tt:0 "Your marshal comes back with harrowing tales"

 dwarven_yearly.0010.t:0 "Mischievous Sprites"
 dwarven_yearly.0010.desc:0 "What began as quiet whispers is now a constant burble of complaint. Things are going missing.\n\nIt began with small things - candles, nails, the occasional rivet. Then things of more import - chisels, awls, and small hammers. Now word comes that still larger things are being carried off; even a whole crate of ore!\n\nIt seems that the blame is being placed on some form of mischievous sprite haunting the lower levels, though the more level-headed are worried that one of our own folk has been thieving. The complaints now come to me in droves, and I’m starting to worry that I’ll soon have a riot on my hands."
 dwarven_yearly.0010.a:0 "Dispatch Loremaster [loremaster.GetNameNoTooltip] to drive out the sprites! [piety cost]"
 dwarven_yearly.0010.b:0 "This sounds like a job for [spymaster.GetNameNoTooltip] - we must root out the thief! [intrigue challenge?]"
 dwarven_yearly.0010.c:0 "It’s a mine. It’s dark. Things go missing all the time."

 dwarven_yearly.0011.t:0 "The Sweet Smell of Death"
 dwarven_yearly.0011.desc:0 "For days now my miners have complained of a curious stench drifting up from the old abandoned mineshafts in the north of [selected_province.GetName]. It catches in the back of throat, and at first seems like the death-reek of some putrefying beast. Yet it also has a sweet tang that is almost enticing, despite the nausea it causes.On inspection the source has been discovered - the almost legendary death flower has taken root in the darkness.\n\nThis rose-like plant needs not the sun, but feeds on insects and other scavengers drawn into the depths by its foetid scent."
 dwarven_yearly.0011.a:0 "Bring wood and oil - we must torch it before it spreads!"
 dwarven_yearly.0011.b:0 "Interesting. Cut a flower and present it to that wretched cur [random courtier/rival?]."
 dwarven_yearly.0011.c:0 "Yes it stinks… but what does it taste like?"
 dwarven_yearly.0011.learning_skill.desc:0 "Discover whether the flower is edible"

 dwarven_yearly.0012.t:0 "A Challenger Approaches"
 dwarven_yearly.0012.desc:0 "Taking a break from poring over documents late into the night, I enter the great dining hall I turn and walk towards the pantry, hoping to get a bite to eat. The hall is abuzz with chatter, yet I quickly slip through the crowds.\n\nMy plan on going unbothered is quickly interrupted as a red-faced [drunkdwarf.GetWomanMan] who is surrounded by a crowd hails out to me, standing on a bench and holding up a mug filled to the brim with beer.\n\n"What's the matter, my serene liege? You look a bit overworked!" [drunkdwarf.GetSheHe] drunkenly exclaims, my stress evident on my face. "Why not take a bit of a break from the toils of being a ruler, and join me in a good old drinking challlenge?"\n\nThe crowd erupts in cheer. [drunkdwarf.GetName] grins toothily. "Unless of course, your highness, yer a little afraid?""
 dwarven_yearly.0012.a:0 "I have no desire for any childish challenge!"
 dwarven_yearly.0012.b:0 "If it's a challenge you want, it's a challenge you'll get!"
 dwarven_yearly.0012.b.success:0 "You bested [drunkdwarf.GetName]"
 dwarven_yearly.0012.b.success.desc:0 "You quaff down pint after pint with ease"

 dwarven_yearly.0012.b.failure.desc:0 "[drunkdwarf.GetName] manages to outdrink you"
 dwarven_yearly.0012.c:0 "Perhaps sobering up in a dungeon will teach you sense!"

 dwarven_yearly.0200.t:0 "Fresh Mountain Air"
 dwarven_yearly.0200.desc:0 "This morning, I woke up feeling tired and restless. After breakfast, I quickly snuck out of my quarters and past my many courtiers and servants, past the gates, and up many, many flights of stairs, until finally, I reached the highest point of my stronghold. I push open the door to an old access shaft, and before me, a great, vast emptiness unfolds - The morning sky, high in the mountains. A fresh breeze caresses my beard as I stretch and take in the fresh air. Though us [dwarves|E] prefer our underground tunnel networks to the open plains of [middleearth|E], its nice to feel the winds in my hair once in a while."
 dwarven_yearly.0200.a:0 "Nothing better to keep a fresh mind!"
 dwarven_yearly.0201.t:0 "A Heated Argument"
 dwarven_yearly.0201.desc:0 "There are some tunnel systems that have been abandoned due to their remoteness, and are mostly completely uninhabited. Two [dwarves|E] recently got into a scuffle about some ore rock found in one of these old tunnels. The first claims to have discovered and taken it, the second claims to have the prospecting rights to this particular tunnel system. It has been brought to my attention, and they hope I can make a ruling on the matter."
 dwarven_yearly.0201.a:0 "The first clearly has the more convincing case."
 dwarven_yearly.0201.b:0 "The second bought the rights, fair and square."
 dwarven_yearly.0201.c:0 "Clearly, this is a gift for the [ROOT.Char.GetTitleTierName]!"
 dwarven_yearly.0201.d:0 "I have no time for dealing with these folks' problems."
 dwarven_yearly.0202.t:0 "Deep Blue"
 dwarven_yearly.0202.desc:0 "Ah, lapis lazuli, the precious blue stone, valued since ancient times! It is rather rare in these parts, and only really has artistic and decorative applications, so when some is found it is often used as a gift to the ruler. A group of local [dwarves|E] has come to present me some as a gift."
 dwarven_yearly.0202.a:0 "This is much appreciated."
 dwarven_yearly.0203.t:0 "[selected_province.GetNameNoTooltip]: Labor Strikes"
 dwarven_yearly.0203.desc:0 "Recently, there have been strikes in my large mines in [selected_province.GetName], a source of much wealth for the region. The miners claim that the taskmasters are ruthless and overwork them, even causing unnecessary injuries among the workers in some cases. With nowhere to turn to, they appeal to me. Both sides present their cases, but both sides seem rather convincing, alas."
 dwarven_yearly.0203.a:0 "The taskmasters are in the wrong, here."
 dwarven_yearly.0203.b:0 "Clearly the miners are in wrong. They are lazy and want less work!"
 dwarven_yearly.0203.c:0 "Help both sides negotiate an agreement before any conflict arises."

 dwarven_yearly.0207.desc:0 "My realm is host to a number of underground hot springs, supplied from natural aquifiers. Today I decided to go visit one of the lesser-known ones, mainly so I could be undisturbed. It feels really relaxing, and helps take my mind of things, if only for a little while. Some say these springs were blessed by [mahalcharacter|E] and even have healing properties!"
 dwarven_yearly.0207.a:0 "I am glad to have made the trip."

 dwarven_yearly.0208.desc:0 "Though it may be hard for some to imagine, picturesque lakes can be found even in the deepest depths below [middleearth|E]. Today, I decided to visit one, to reflect and relax. The lakes color is of the deepest of blues, like lapis lazuli, and the surrounding cave walls seem to rise endlessly into the darkness."
 dwarven_yearly.0208.a:0 "I will relax and take in the atmosphere."

Some workers have informed me that they have come upon a previously undiscovered wall of Cirth text, likely written dozens of centuries ago. Though so much time has passed, the inscription is still legible, a testament to the [khazad|E] ability to preserve the language of [mahalcharacter|E] perfectly."
 dwarven_yearly.0209.picto.desc:0 "For most of our history, us [dwarves|E] had no true written script, utilizing basic runes or idographic and pictographic writing.

 dwarven_yearly.0210.desc:0 "Today I've come to [selected_province.GetName] to inspect the local workshops.

I could, if I so desired, order my workers to very quickly mine out as much of the deposit as possible. This would lead to a significant boost in immediate quarterly profits, but would likely reduce the long term profits of the mine as hastily built tunnels have to be reinforced and some deposits are overlooked.
