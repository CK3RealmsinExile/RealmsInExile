Since they have returned to these halls they have been arguing about who their plunder belongs to. Their argument starts to quickly escalate and a fight between them is imminent.\n\nI could just observe their fight... or I could fight one of them personally and take their loot while the other runs away with their part. Or perhaps I could try to fight both of them and take all their plunder as mine. Alternatively, I could try to convince them that the loot belongs mainly to me and then equally to both of them."

 goblin_yearly.0102.t: "Duel Turned Sour"
 goblin_yearly.0102.desc: "The duel was meant to be sport — a clash to settle words, nothing more. But when [orc_potential_rival.GetName]’s blade struck me to the ground, he stood over me sneering.\n\n"Yield, worm," he hissed, loud enough for the crowd to hear.\n\nRespect dies in that moment.

 goblin_yearly.0105.b: "Keep it. I’ll take coin instead."

 goblin_yearly.0106.t: "Training Accident"
 goblin_yearly.0106.desc: "We fought like beasts in a pit.

Not a grin of apology, but of triumph.\n\n"You’ll live… though weaker for it."\n\nThe scar may fade, but hatred does not."

 goblin_yearly.0131.t: "Bloodied Banner"
 goblin_yearly.0131.desc: "My war-banner was dragged through the muck and hung upside down in the village square. Orcs laughed as they passed, spitting on it, knowing well whose hand had done it.

 goblin_yearly.0132.t: "Insult at the Feast"
 goblin_yearly.0132.desc: "The firepit crackled, the mead ran strong, and the hall was thick with the stench of sweat and roasted flesh. My rival raised his cup high, bellowing: ‘A toast! To warriors with tusks! And to those without the bite to use them!’ His eyes burned into mine as the hall erupted in savage laughter, fists pounding the tables. Orc feasts thrive on mockery, but this was no drunken jest — this was a challenge to my blood."
 goblin_yearly.0132.a: "I’ll rip his tongue from his skull."
 goblin_yearly.0132.b: "Choke it down with the grog."

 goblin_yearly.0133.t: "Desecrated Grave"
 goblin_yearly.0133.desc: "My war camp was raided in the night — not by outsiders, but by his hand. My weapons, my furs, my spoils, torn apart and scattered in the dirt like a dog’s leavings. He wants the clan to see me weakened, stripped of what I’ve taken by right. For an orc, plunder is not wealth — it is proof of strength. And now my strength lies in tatters."
 goblin_yearly.0133.a: "I’ll scatter his skull across the mud."

 goblin_yearly.0135.t: "Whispers of Weakness"
 goblin_yearly.0135.desc: "Everywhere in my halls I hear the same venom: ‘Too soft… too slow… too weak to rule.’ He has poisoned ears with lies, turned laughter into knives aimed at my back. Even those who feast at my fire glance at me with smirks, as if waiting for my strength to falter.\n\nAmong orcs, weakness is blood in the water. One rumor breeds ten, and ten will see a warband split apart. This is not mere insult — it is a blade pressed against my rule itself, waiting for the push."
 goblin_yearly.0135.a: "I’ll tear his jaw off."
 goblin_yearly.0135.b: "Snarl, but walk away."

 goblin_yearly.0136.t: "Stolen Trophies"
 goblin_yearly.0136.desc: "My trophies — skulls ripped from foes, banners torn from burning halls, clawed hides from beasts I slew with my own hand — gone. Later I found them strung across his hall, hung high so that every orc could see them, as if he had carved the kills himself.\n\nHe drinks beneath them, smirking, daring me to act. Orcs live by their trophies — they are proof of every kill, every raid, every victory. To have them stolen is not shame. It is theft of my very strength. And strength demands blood."
 goblin_yearly.0136.a: "I’ll take them back in his screams."
 goblin_yearly.0136.b: "Let him choke on false glory."

 goblin_yearly.0137.t: "Mockery of the Hunt"
 goblin_yearly.0137.desc: "On the hunt, I brought down a beast with my own hand. Yet before I could claim it, my rival stepped forth, split the carcass open, and bellowed: ‘See how he needs me to finish his kill!’ The hunters laughed, their eyes gleaming. To be mocked in the hunt is to be mocked as an orc."
 goblin_yearly.0137.a: "His hide will hang beside the beast’s."
 goblin_yearly.0137.b: "Laugh along, bile burning my throat."

 goblin_yearly.0138.t: "Defied in Council"
 goblin_yearly.0138.desc: "In the council, as we debated war, my rival rose and roared: ‘Why listen to him? He has no teeth, no strength! I should be chief, not this one!’ The other orcs stirred, some even nodding. His words were not just insult — they were challenge."
 goblin_yearly.0138.a: "He’ll choke on those words."
 goblin_yearly.0138.b: "Dismiss him, bleeding pride."

 goblin_yearly.0139.t: "Spilled Blood in Sport"
 goblin_yearly.0139.desc: "We drank deep, the hall thick with grog and smoke. The chants began — fists pounding, tusks bared — until someone shoved us into the circle. Clashes like these are common, drunk with rage and laughter. But my rival struck with more than grog in his belly. His blade caught me deep, and as I bled onto the floor, he laughed and said: ‘Didn’t know it was your blood I was spilling.’\n\nAmong orcs, brawls mean broken bones and pride. But his cut was no accident — it was a warning."
 goblin_yearly.0139.a: "From this day, we are blood-foes."
 goblin_yearly.0139.b: "Stumble off, blood in my beard."

 goblin_yearly.0140.t: "Scorned Kin"
 goblin_yearly.0140.desc: "After the raid, as the spoils were divided, my rival stood before the warband and roared: ‘Why follow him? He brings back scraps, while I would bring back feasts! His commands lead to nothing but empty bellies!\n\nThe others jeered, tusks gleaming, some pounding their chests in agreement. This was no petty insult. He cut at my ability to lead raids, to command warriors — the heart of orc rule itself."
 goblin_yearly.0140.a: "I’ll shatter him before the warband."
 goblin_yearly.0140.b: "Let the insult burn in silence."
