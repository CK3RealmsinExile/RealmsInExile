It is sharpened and polished, so I see a fraction of my own visage within it.\n\n"You should carry this for your own sake. Dissenters scurry through your court like diseased rats, and each time we attend a public function, I wonder if it is our last."\n\n[marshal.GetSheHe|U] stares out of the window. "Perhaps we ought to increase the guard patrols... There is a sickly taste to this morning's air, and I am afraid.""
 yearly.7001.a:0 "It will unnerve the guests! This is mere paranoia."
 yearly.7001.b:0 "Add a few more patrols in for luck."

I wish for your life to be spared, but try as I may, I cannot stop my heart from bleeding for the cause of the [coup_faction.GetName].\n\nI have dashed into exile. We shall not meet again."
 yearly.7002.a:0 "I can trust no one!"

I keep losing my grip."\n\nAs the voices bicker, I quite easily struggle enough for them to drop the bag.

 yearly.7010.desc:0 "A trip out to one of the villages in your holding has led me into an intriguing situation. What appears to be the vast majority of the village has turned out into the market square, and two motley groups of people have formed.\n\nEquidistant to both of them – visible from my position only by virtue of the rather apprehensive-looking villager holding it – appears to be an inflated pig’s bladder.\n\nPerhaps noticing my quizzical expression, a valet quickly explains the situation: it turns out this is some form of popular game!"

 yearly.7011.desc:0 "It is with some anxiety that my trusty valet informs me of the rules and regulations of the coming event. As it happens, this game of so-called #EMP ‘foot ball’ #! is very widely played, and encompasses all manner of people.\n\nSupposedly, both sides endeavor to move the ‘ball’ – as the pig’s bladder is known – to the side of the village that their group is not defending by any means necessary.\n\nThat final part was intoned with significant gravitas, and the explanation was swift: whilst death is rare, injury is not."
 yearly.7011.a:0 "Do you think there’s a spot for me?"

 #Pre-game: Literal Under Armour

 yearly.7012.desc:0 "As I stand amongst the townspeople, I spy one middle-aged [dummy_gender.GetWomanMan] adjusting some leather straps beneath [dummy_gender.GetHerHis] tunic. Now that I notice, in fact, [dummy_gender.GetHerHis] entire midriff looks entirely too bulky for someone of [dummy_gender.GetHerHis] relatively scraggy stature, [dummy_gender.GetHerHis] chest and stomach straining somewhat against the confines of [dummy_gender.GetHerHis] clothes. Noticing my interest, he grins, beckons me closer, and lifts the fabric.\n\nBeneath [dummy_gender.GetHerHis] tunic, wrapped around [dummy_gender.GetHerHis] body, are layers of crude wooden slats in the approximation of armor.\n\n“I call it #EMP ‘under-armor’#!!” [dummy_gender.GetSheHe] says proudly, with an accompanying wink."

Dressed in rich furs and with a small retinue of people, [dummy_gender.GetSheHe] is engaged in lively conversation with another, significantly larger [dummy_gender.GetWomanMan]. Wending my way through the crowd, I arrive in their vicinity just to see the wealthy merchant drop a small coin purse into the other’s hand.\n\n”...pleasure doing business with you. Now make sure my bet is a safe one!” the jowly merchant smirks.\n\nAs the large [dummy_gender.GetWomanMan] begins to walk over to the other team’s group, it appears some care not for the sanctity of the game…"

 yearly.7013.b:0 "Disgusting. Would never have happened in my day!"

 yearly.7014.desc:1 "An enterprising local baker has clearly noted the gathering crowds, and [dummy_gender.GetHerHis] two rickety carts full of freshly-baked pies are in high demand.\n\nSauntering over to the cart that the opposition team are crowding around, I note the spokes of one of the wheels is practically splintering. No sooner does the thought come to my mind than an opportunity arise to put it into practice, as the sonorous crash of something falling over on the far side of the square causes everyone to turn and gawp.\n\nOne swift kick to that spoke, and…"
 yearly.7014.desc.1:0 "An enterprising local baker has clearly noted the gathering crowds, and [dummy_gender.GetHerHis] two rickety carts full of freshly-baked meat pies are in high demand.\n\nSauntering over to the cart that the opposition team are crowding around, I take a glance over the racks of piping-hot pastries. No sooner does the thought come to my mind than an opportunity arise to put it into practice, as the sonorous crash of something falling over on the far side of the square causes everyone to turn and gawp.\n\nMy hand flits to the small pouch of hemlock at my waist…"
 yearly.7014.a:0 "Let’s see how well you play now…"

 yearly.7015.desc:0 "As I ready myself for the coming exertion, I spy a [dummy_gender.GetWomanMan] on the fringes of the crowd taking swigs from a flask, [dummy_gender.GetHerHis] eyes darting around in between gulps. Normally this wouldn’t be overly-suspect, but [dummy_gender.GetHerHis] furtiveness is, and even more so when [dummy_gender.GetSheHe] quails before my inquisitive tap on the shoulder.\n\nWhatever [dummy_gender.GetSheHe] is drinking isn’t water: the liquid is somewhat opaque, and it’s clear from [dummy_gender.GetHerHis] wincing whenever [dummy_gender.GetHerHis] lips touch it that it’s surely not pleasant to taste. Fortunately, [dummy_gender.GetSheHe] is almost eager to spill [dummy_gender.GetHerHis] secrets when gently prodded.\n\n’Performance enhancing’, you say?"
 yearly.7015.a:0 "...how much do you want for that?"
 yearly.7015.b:0 "You should be ashamed of yourself!"

 yearly.7020.desc:0 "With all the pre-game niceties taken care of, all that remains is to initiate the event. The town crier, leaning dangerously out of the first-floor window of a house overlooking the square, bundles the pig’s bladder through the frame.\n\nThe crowd look up expectantly and, after a short pause, the ‘ball’ takes flight.\n\nThe stampede begins."

 #First half: A villager comes at you with a rock!
 yearly.7021.t:0 "The Beautiful Game: Rock On"
 yearly.7021.desc:0 "The so-called ‘game’ is far more than you’d bargained for. The reputation of violence is not unwarranted, either.\n\nTo your left, one [dummy_gender.GetWomanMan] has another in a makeshift headlock, the pair of them staggering past a full-on fistfight between - seemingly - four people at once.\n\nAs I distance myself from that particular melee, another villager - wild-eyed underneath a mask of blood streaming down from a forehead cut - approaches me with a rock in hand."

The ball carrier is a good-looking young [dummy_gender.GetWomanMan], and clearly a crafty one too; having secured the ball, [dummy_gender.GetSheHe] is in the process of scaling a house to get away from the baying crowd below.\n\nWhilst [dummy_gender.GetHerHis] plan initially seems watertight, it seems [dummy_gender.GetSheHe] has reckoned without [dummy_gender.GetHerHis] base desires: as I haul myself up to [dummy_gender.GetHerHis] level on the facade of the house, [dummy_gender.GetSheHe] is clearly distracted by a particularly winsome [same_gender.GetWomanMan] at the window.\n\nThe two of them seem quite smitten by each other. I'm just within arm’s reach..."

As the group recoils from the walls, several people hang on to whatever outcroppings they can as others try and rip them away to get to the ball carrier.\n\nThe sound of splintering wood and crumpling wattle rings around the market square, and as the crowd retreats several sections of the house's thatched roof tumbles to the ground."

Someone staggers by me, bruising already evident on their head.\n\nSuddenly, one more man from the group drops at my feet with an earsplitting scream.

But it is pitch black.\n\nI carefully approach the hole and try to peer inside, confused as to it's origin and purpose."
 yearly.7053.a: "The groundskeeper should know more about this."
 yearly.7053.b: "I think I see something..."

 yearly.7054.t: "A Brisk Awakening"
 yearly.7054.intro: "I am carefully shaken awake by one of the servants. [7054_servant.GetSheHe|U] looks at me anxiously and exclaims: "My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord]! Are you alright?" as I look around the corridor, dazed.\n\nDid I black out?"
 yearly.7054.desc_pouch: "Still in my hand, I clutch the pouch with gold that I managed to pull from the... hole?"
 yearly.7054.desc_scratch: "There's a burning sensation on my arm; the one I put in the... hole?"
 yearly.7054.desc: "I vaguely recall something about a conversation I was to have with the groundskeeper... about a hole?"
 yearly.7054.outro: "\n\nRushing to my feet, I stare at the wall. "There was a hole here," I mumble as my gaze sweeps across the bright walls of the corridor."
 yearly.7054.a: "... I must have been imagining things."
 yearly.7054.a.flavor_pouch: "I clutch the pouch tightly."

 #It was the dog all along
 yearly.7055.t: "A Holding for a Dog"
 yearly.7055.desc: "As I cross the courtyard, a stray mutt comes running out of nowhere and stops right in front of me. Some strange pieces of metal are attached to its collar.\n\nThe dog looks at me expectantly as I peer down into its brown eyes, slightly annoyed at the interruption. My annoyance quickly fades away though, and I get the weird sense that the dog is controlling... things?\n\nI truly am losing my marbles, I think, as I grasp the dog collar and remove the ridiculous pieces of metal. When I turn to leave, the dog looks at me sternly. I guess... it belongs to me now?"
 yearly.7055.a: "Here, dog."
 yearly.7055.b: "Go #EMP away#!, you mangy dog!"
 yearly.7055.b.flavor: "The dog looks at you with hurt in its eyes."
