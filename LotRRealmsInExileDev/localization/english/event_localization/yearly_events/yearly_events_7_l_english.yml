 ## Desperate faction vassals attempt a coup by Isabella Welch
 yearly.7001.t:0 "The Last Day"
 yearly.7001.desc:0 "My [marshal.GetCouncilTitle], [marshal.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip], hands me my favorite [ROOT.Char.Custom('signature_weapon')]. It is sharpened and polished, so I see a fraction of my own visage within it.\n\n"You should carry this for your own sake. Dissenters scurry through your court like diseased rats, and each time we attend a public function, I wonder if it is our last."\n\n[marshal.GetSheHe|U] stares out of the window. "Perhaps we ought to increase the guard patrols... There is a sickly taste to this morning's air, and I am afraid.""
 yearly.7001.a:0 "It will unnerve the guests! This is mere paranoia."
 yearly.7001.b:0 "Add a few more patrols in for luck."
 yearly.7001.c:0 "Do you #EMP know#! something, [marshal.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip]?"
 yearly.7001.c.tt:0 "[marshal.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] tells you more of [marshal.GetHerHis] suspicions"
 yearly.7001.tt:0 "[marshal.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] brushes aside your questions"
 yearly.7001.d:0 "Pack the [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('FortifiedBuilding')] with guards. Let no room remain unwatched!"
 yearly.7001.d.tt:0 "You scare everyone who comes to court"
 yearly.7001.d.win.tt:0 "You scare factions targeting you"

## Letter of warning from your marshal who is a sympathizer

 yearly.7002:0 "You are in immediate peril, my [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetLadyLord|U]"
 yearly.7002.d:0 "I feel nothing but shame as I scribe these words. [coup_leader.GetTitledFirstName] has spent months bribing your guards. [coup_leader.GetSheHe|U] plans to stage an attack on your life in front the court... I wish for your life to be spared, but try as I may, I cannot stop my heart from bleeding for the cause of the [coup_faction.GetName].\n\nI have dashed into exile. We shall not meet again."
 yearly.7002.a:0 "I can trust no one!"
 yearly.7002.b:0 "I must trust some of my closest [ROOT.Char.Custom('KnightCulturePluralNoTooltipLowercase')] to guard me!"
 yearly.7002.b.tt:0 "[knight_1.GetTitledFirstName] and [knight_2.GetTitledFirstName] are some of my finest warriors. I must hope they will protect me."
 yearly.7002.c:0 "I can defend myself!"
 yearly.7002.b.tt.2:0 "You confide in two of your guards"
 yearly.7002.c.tt:0 "You keep this a secret"

#### Traitor knights carry you off in a sack
 yearly.7004.desc:0 ""Hurry! [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetSheHe|U] is waking up!"\n\nAs I awaken, my pillow feels coarser than usual. My head is spinning, but the rest of my body goes with it and everything remains dark. I am not in my bed, but being dragged along the ground in a sack.\n\n"[ROOT.GetCharacter.GetSheHe|U] is squirming too much! I keep losing my grip."\n\nAs the voices bicker, I quite easily struggle enough for them to drop the bag. When I crawl free, I realize they've barely gotten a few paces beyond the [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('FortifiedBuilding')] garden."
 yearly.7004.tt:0 "The plots of the faction have been foiled"
 yearly.7004.a:0 "You call this a kidnapping? I'd at least expect you to get to [neighbor_county.GetNameNoTier]."
 yearly.7004.b:0 "Traitors! You shall both languish in sacks in my dungeon!"
 yearly.7004.c:0 "Carry me back to my bed at once!"
 yearly.7004.c.tt:0 "You are returned to the sack and ferried to your chamber"

#### Assassination attempt

 yearly.7005.increased_security:1 "The [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('FortifiedBuilding')] is quiet, a few groups whisper. All are on edge seeing my throne room lined with guards."
 yearly.7005.throne_approach:0 "[coup_leader.GetTitledFirstName] approaches my throne."
 yearly.7005.liberty_faction:0 ""It seems the only way to break the chains around our necks is to slit both mine and yours.""

 yearly.7005.populist_faction:0 ""It sorrows me, I swear, that I cannot but grant you a fairer death than the agonies of all those who have been crushed under your foot. At least my end shall be that of a hero.""

 yearly.7005.no_death:0 "This brash madness is quickly ended as my [ROOT.Char.Custom('KnightCulturePluralNoTooltipLowercase')] swiftly encircle [coup_leader.GetHerHim]."
 yearly.7005.failure:0 "As the guards grasp [coup_leader.GetHerHim], I realize [coup_leader.GetSheHe] is furiously trying to push the blade into [coup_leader.GetHerHis] own heart rather than be caught."
 yearly.7005.ruler_death:1 "Their blood soon mingles with my own as I feel the [coup_leader.Custom('SignatureWeaponNameOrType')] strike my chest."
 yearly.7005.success:1 "It is foolish to think [coup_leader.GetSheHe] could take my throne in this tiny coup, but as [coup_leader.GetSheHe] turns a blade to [coup_leader.GetHerHis] own throat, I realize this was never what [coup_leader.GetSheHe] wanted."
 yearly.7005.a:0 "Guards, restrain [coup_leader.GetHerHim], [coup_leader.GetSheHe] cannot become a martyr for dissidents."
 yearly.7005.b:0 "Let [coup_leader.GetHerHim] do it."
 yearly.7005.c:0 "You deserve a far worse fate than to die here!"
 yearly.7005.c.tt:0 "You blind and imprison [coup_leader.GetTitledFirstName]"

 yearly.7010.t:0 "The Beautiful Game"
 yearly.7010.desc:0 "A trip out to one of the villages in your holding has led me into an intriguing situation. What appears to be the vast majority of the village has turned out into the market square, and two motley groups of people have formed.\n\nEquidistant to both of them – visible from my position only by virtue of the rather apprehensive-looking villager holding it – appears to be an inflated pig’s bladder.\n\nPerhaps noticing my quizzical expression, a valet quickly explains the situation: it turns out this is some form of popular game!"
 yearly.7010.a:0 "How fascinating! What are the rules?"
 yearly.7010.b:0 "Well, we better leave them to it."
 yearly.7010.tt.yes:0 "Investigate the goings-on."
 yearly.7010.tt.win:0 "This may help you win!"
 yearly.7010.tt.lose:0 "Choosing this might lessen your chances of victory!"

 yearly.7011.t:0 "The Beautiful Game: Weighing The Risks"
 yearly.7011.desc:0 "It is with some anxiety that my trusty valet informs me of the rules and regulations of the coming event. As it happens, this game of so-called #EMP ‘foot ball’ #! is very widely played, and encompasses all manner of people.\n\nSupposedly, both sides endeavor to move the ‘ball’ – as the pig’s bladder is known – to the side of the village that their group is not defending by any means necessary.\n\nThat final part was intoned with significant gravitas, and the explanation was swift: whilst death is rare, injury is not."
 yearly.7011.a:0 "Do you think there’s a spot for me?"
 yearly.7011.b:0 "Typical commoner pastime. Leave them to it."
 yearly.7011.tt:0 "Fetch me my boots!"

 yearly.7012.t:0 "The Beautiful Game: All The Gear..."
 yearly.7012.desc:0 "As I stand amongst the townspeople, I spy one middle-aged [dummy_gender.GetWomanMan] adjusting some leather straps beneath [dummy_gender.GetHerHis] tunic. Now that I notice, in fact, [dummy_gender.GetHerHis] entire midriff looks entirely too bulky for someone of [dummy_gender.GetHerHis] relatively scraggy stature, [dummy_gender.GetHerHis] chest and stomach straining somewhat against the confines of [dummy_gender.GetHerHis] clothes. Noticing my interest, he grins, beckons me closer, and lifts the fabric.\n\nBeneath [dummy_gender.GetHerHis] tunic, wrapped around [dummy_gender.GetHerHis] body, are layers of crude wooden slats in the approximation of armor.\n\n“I call it #EMP ‘under-armor’#!!” [dummy_gender.GetSheHe] says proudly, with an accompanying wink."
 yearly.7012.a:0 "How much do you want for it?"
 yearly.7012.b:0 "What a ridiculous premise."
 
 yearly.7013.t:0 "The Beautiful Game: A Big Signing"
 yearly.7013.desc:0 "Observing the mass of people, I can see a [dummy_gender.GetWomanMan] who looks curiously out of place. Dressed in rich furs and with a small retinue of people, [dummy_gender.GetSheHe] is engaged in lively conversation with another, significantly larger [dummy_gender.GetWomanMan]. Wending my way through the crowd, I arrive in their vicinity just to see the wealthy merchant drop a small coin purse into the other’s hand.\n\n”...pleasure doing business with you. Now make sure my bet is a safe one!” the jowly merchant smirks.\n\nAs the large [dummy_gender.GetWomanMan] begins to walk over to the other team’s group, it appears some care not for the sanctity of the game…"
 yearly.7013.a:0 "Wait! Whatever [dummy_gender.GetSheHe] paid you, I’ll double it!"
 yearly.7013.b:0 "Disgusting. Would never have happened in my day!"
 yearly.7013.c:0 "Looks like we’ll just have to win without [dummy_gender.GetHerHim]!"

 yearly.7014.t:0 "The Beautiful Game: Eyes On The Pies"
 yearly.7014.desc:1 "An enterprising local baker has clearly noted the gathering crowds, and [dummy_gender.GetHerHis] two rickety carts full of freshly-baked pies are in high demand.\n\nSauntering over to the cart that the opposition team are crowding around, I note the spokes of one of the wheels is practically splintering. No sooner does the thought come to my mind than an opportunity arise to put it into practice, as the sonorous crash of something falling over on the far side of the square causes everyone to turn and gawp.\n\nOne swift kick to that spoke, and…"
 yearly.7014.desc.1:0 "An enterprising local baker has clearly noted the gathering crowds, and [dummy_gender.GetHerHis] two rickety carts full of freshly-baked meat pies are in high demand.\n\nSauntering over to the cart that the opposition team are crowding around, I take a glance over the racks of piping-hot pastries. No sooner does the thought come to my mind than an opportunity arise to put it into practice, as the sonorous crash of something falling over on the far side of the square causes everyone to turn and gawp.\n\nMy hand flits to the small pouch of hemlock at my waist…"
 yearly.7014.a:0 "Let’s see how well you play now…"
 yearly.7014.b:0 "Oh no, all the pies fell into the dirt!"
 yearly.7014.c:0 "I’d better not."
 yearly.7014.hemlock:0 "Sprinkle a little extra ingredient on the pies..."

 yearly.7015.t:0 "The Beautiful Game: Performance-Enhancing Drafts"
 yearly.7015.desc:0 "As I ready myself for the coming exertion, I spy a [dummy_gender.GetWomanMan] on the fringes of the crowd taking swigs from a flask, [dummy_gender.GetHerHis] eyes darting around in between gulps. Normally this wouldn’t be overly-suspect, but [dummy_gender.GetHerHis] furtiveness is, and even more so when [dummy_gender.GetSheHe] quails before my inquisitive tap on the shoulder.\n\nWhatever [dummy_gender.GetSheHe] is drinking isn’t water: the liquid is somewhat opaque, and it’s clear from [dummy_gender.GetHerHis] wincing whenever [dummy_gender.GetHerHis] lips touch it that it’s surely not pleasant to taste. Fortunately, [dummy_gender.GetSheHe] is almost eager to spill [dummy_gender.GetHerHis] secrets when gently prodded.\n\n’Performance enhancing’, you say?"
 yearly.7015.a:0 "...how much do you want for that?"
 yearly.7015.b:0 "You should be ashamed of yourself!"

 yearly.7020.t:0 "The Beautiful Game: Kickoff"
 yearly.7020.desc:0 "With all the pre-game niceties taken care of, all that remains is to initiate the event. The town crier, leaning dangerously out of the first-floor window of a house overlooking the square, bundles the pig’s bladder through the frame.\n\nThe crowd look up expectantly and, after a short pause, the ‘ball’ takes flight.\n\nThe stampede begins."
 yearly.7020.a:0 "Follow me, team!"
 yearly.7020.b:0 "AAAAAAAAAAARGGGHHHH!"

 yearly.7021.t:0 "The Beautiful Game: Rock On"
 yearly.7021.desc:0 "The so-called ‘game’ is far more than you’d bargained for. The reputation of violence is not unwarranted, either.\n\nTo your left, one [dummy_gender.GetWomanMan] has another in a makeshift headlock, the pair of them staggering past a full-on fistfight between - seemingly - four people at once.\n\nAs I distance myself from that particular melee, another villager - wild-eyed underneath a mask of blood streaming down from a forehead cut - approaches me with a rock in hand."
 yearly.7021.a:0 "Hey! That’s illegal!"
 yearly.7021.b:0 "I’LL MAKE YOU EAT THAT ROCK!"
 yearly.7021.c:0 "Time to get out of here!"
 yearly.7021.a.tt.win:0 "You knock the rock away!"

 yearly.7022.t:0 "The Beautiful Game: A Comely Spectator"
 yearly.7022.desc:0 "The opposition team has the ball! The ball carrier is a good-looking young [dummy_gender.GetWomanMan], and clearly a crafty one too; having secured the ball, [dummy_gender.GetSheHe] is in the process of scaling a house to get away from the baying crowd below.\n\nWhilst [dummy_gender.GetHerHis] plan initially seems watertight, it seems [dummy_gender.GetSheHe] has reckoned without [dummy_gender.GetHerHis] base desires: as I haul myself up to [dummy_gender.GetHerHis] level on the facade of the house, [dummy_gender.GetSheHe] is clearly distracted by a particularly winsome [same_gender.GetWomanMan] at the window.\n\nThe two of them seem quite smitten by each other. I'm just within arm’s reach..."
 yearly.7022.a:0 "Yoink!"
 yearly.7022.b:0 "Ah, young love!"
 yearly.7022.c:0 "Ha! I'll show you what a real [ROOT.Char.GetWomanMan] looks like!"

 yearly.7023.t:0 "The Beautiful Game: The Hand Of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]"
 yearly.7023.desc:0 "The pig bladder is loose! A nervous pair of hands fumble it, and it bounces once before being grabbed by… a member of the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.AltPriestTermPlural]?\n\n[dummy_clergy_gender.GetSheHe|U] grins and stumbles forward, the crowd parting uncertainly before [dummy_clergy_gender.GetHerHim]. Nobody is quite sure what to make of this holy person playing such a violent game and, moreover, seemingly getting away with it!\n\nI step forward dubiously..."
 yearly.7023.a:0 "...and punch [dummy_clergy_gender.GetHerHim] right in the face."
 yearly.7023.b:0 "...and step aside. Let someone else deal with [dummy_clergy_gender.GetHerHim]."

 yearly.7024.t:0 "The Beautiful Game: Thatch Of The Hay"
 yearly.7024.desc:0 "The mob surges and crashes against the walls of a nearby house like a wave. As the group recoils from the walls, several people hang on to whatever outcroppings they can as others try and rip them away to get to the ball carrier.\n\nThe sound of splintering wood and crumpling wattle rings around the market square, and as the crowd retreats several sections of the house's thatched roof tumbles to the ground."
 yearly.7024.a:0 "I’ll pay for the refurbishments!"
 yearly.7024.b:0 "All’s fair in love and football!"

 yearly.7030.t:0 "The Beautiful Game: Never A Pen"
 yearly.7030.desc:0 "As the game wears on, more and more of the villagers have to drop out. Someone staggers by me, bruising already evident on their head.\n\nSuddenly, one more man from the group drops at my feet with an earsplitting scream. The noise is enough to even distract the participants, and both the crowd and I step back away from his writhing - though I could’ve #EMP sworn#! I saw one eye open there...\n\nThe moment enough daylight shows through the crowd, the ‘injured’ man leaps to his feet and scoops up the ball, haring towards me across the square!"
 yearly.7030.a:0 "I-... wuh-... #EMP ref!#!"

 yearly.7031.desc:0 "The game continues, and I note my team’s ranks beginning to thin. Several participants are strewn across the market square, all of them nursing ankle injuries. #EMP Serious#! ankle injuries, by the looks. As I battle with those around me, a glint near the floor catches my eye, and I realise with some horror exactly what fate has befallen my comrades.\n\nSome particularly bloodthirsty villager has sewn small blades into their shoes, and even as I watch they rake it brutally into another’s shins. I consider pushing forward to confront them."
 yearly.7031.a:0 "Get those shoes off them!"
 yearly.7031.b:0 "I like my shins how they are!"

 yearly.7032.desc:0 "The horde lurches sideways, expelling me from its depths with some force. Staggering over to a wall to get both my bearings and my breath, I spy a couple of traders laden with various refreshments. They must be doing good business, given what hard work this is!\n\nI could do with some sustenance, as it happens. I wonder what they have for sale?"

 yearly.7033.desc:0 "Fighting the opposition during these games is extremely common, but it’s with some confusion that I can see what appears to be two of my teammates fighting #EMP! each other#!. You recognize each; one is the local bowyer, the other a dyer of textiles. The two are locked in ferocious combat, so much so their teammates have begun to notice.\n\nThis petty dispute is beginning to tie up significant portions of my team, and the mass of people begins to grind towards the side of the village we're defending..."
