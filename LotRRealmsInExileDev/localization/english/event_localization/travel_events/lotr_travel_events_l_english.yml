After some time, I eventually come across a colossal wreck - Two vast and trunkless legs of stone stand on a pedestal in the desert.\nNear them, on the sand, half sunk, a shattered visage lies. On the pedestal, these words appear:\n\n#V "MY NAME IS AR-ZÎMANDÂS, KING OF KINGS: LOOK ON MY WORKS, YE MIGHTY, AND DESPAIR!"#!\n\nNothing else remains beside that colossal wreck.

 lotr_travel_events.0002.desc:0 "Dawn is setting as we make our way through the seemingly endless Dune Sea. Suddendly, I notice the sands beginning to shift a short distance to my left. A smooth, black shell appears, then three pairs of burning red eyes. Two giant pincers and a deadly stinger, large enough to impale a man, arise from the dunes.\n\nJust as I and my companions spring back, a giant scorpion emerges from its hiding spot, raising its claws and chittering angrily. My companions are terrified, why did we choose this path!?"
 lotr_travel_events.0002.desc.again:0 "The sun is still high in the sky as we continue to make our way through the seemingly endless Dune Sea. Suddendly, I notice the sands beginning to shift a short distance to my right, with some now oh-so familiar chittering sounds.\n\nThis time, three giant scorpions burst from the sands, giant pincers clacking and with deadly stingers large enough to impale a man. These things must really hold a grudge!"

 lotr_travel_events.0003.desc:0 "As we make our way through the endless ocean of sand, dubbed the "Mirror of Fire" by the locals, we see something strange on the horizon: A great wall seems to stretch across the entire horizon in front of us. No, not a wall... a storm!\n\nPanic breaks out among my people, as we begin to hastily set camp - The Dune Sea is feared for its deathly dust storms known as the 'Breath of Sanbaiz'.

 lotr_travel_events.0004.desc:0 "Today, my entourage makes their way past the woods of Rhosgobel. The birds are chirping and we are rather relaxed.\n\nPerhaps I could spend some time relaxing in the woods by myself? They do not seem particularly dangerous, and this could be a good moment to reflect."

 lotr_travel_events.0005.desc:0 "Soon I am back on the road, although this road is more of an overgrown path, and on my way through Rhosgobel. I spend many hours in the forest, inhabited by an unusually large number of animals and I reflect on my rule and the life behind me.\nEventually I turn back out of the forest and prepare to return to my entourage."
 lotr_travel_events.0005.a:0 "At least the weather was nice."
 lotr_travel_events.0005.att:0 "You return to your travel companions"

 #lotr_travel_events.0006.desc.intro:0 "Soon I am back on the road and on my way through Rhosgobel. I spend many hours in the forest, which seems to be house an unusually large number of animals. It is a nice day, though I can only barely make out the sun through the crowns of the trees."
 lotr_travel_events.0006.desc.intro:0 "I spend many hours in the forest. It is a nice day, though I can only barely make out the sun through the crowns of the trees."
 lotr_travel_events.0006.desc.advice1:0 " I walk deeper and deeper into the woods, and eventually I realize I have gotten lost. After a while, I encounter a peculiar wanderer, an old man clad in brown garb wearing an unusual hat. He seems to be collecting mushrooms. I greet him and respectfully ask for a way out of the forest. He replies, though he doesn't really seem to pay attention to me:\n\n"Out of the forest? Very simple, just climb up a tree and look around! Ooh, this is a nice one..."\n\nI follow his advice and from the top of the tree I am able to make out the road! When I climb down, I realize he has disappeared and it slowly dawns on me this may have been the [sageofthewoods|E] himself! But did his advice have any deeper meaning?"
 lotr_travel_events.0006.desc.advice2:0 " As I make my way through a dense bush, I suddenly spot an odd figure, an old man clad in brown garb and wearing an unusual hat, some distance away. He appears to be mumbling at someone else, though I can only make out a few words: \n\n"...there, there, I have enough. Hah! You are a funny one. Yes, perhaps they truly are the pinnacle of creation!"\n\nUpon closer inspection, he appears to be feeding acorns to a large deer. Moments later, he seems to have disappeared between two trees. It slowly dawns on me that this may have been the [sageofthewoods|E] himself! But do his words have any deeper meaning?"
 lotr_travel_events.0006.desc.advice3:0 " Eventually an old man, clad in brown garb and wearing an unusual hat, appears from the foliage to my right, intending to cross the road. He seems to be upset. As we cross paths he grumbles something vaguely directed at me:\n\n"Ho there! Have you seen my hat? Its a nice hat, very big, but I lost it!" He then lets out a long sigh. "Well, it can't be that far! It'll show up again eventually, always does, so I suppose it's not too bad."\n\nI am too baffled to respond to him and he passes me quickly, going off into the deep woods to my left. It slowly dawns on me that this may have been the [sageofthewoods|E] himself! But do his words have any deeper meaning?" 
 lotr_travel_events.0006.desc.advice4:0 " Eventually, I come across a large bush of blueberries and decide to rest for a bit. While I am holding my impromptu berry-feast, a peculiar wanderer, an old man clad in brown garb wearing an unusual hat, walks by. He takes a moment to smell the bush, then picks a single berry and puts it into his mouth.\n\n"I like blueberries, but they taste sweetest when you eat them one at a time!"\n\nWith that, he continues to make his way through the forest, soon disappearing between two trees. After I finish my rest, it slowly dawns on me that this may have been the [sageofthewoods|E] himself! But do his words have any deeper meaning?"
 
 lotr_travel_events.0006.b:0 "I am reading too much into this."
 lotr_travel_events.0006.a:0 "But what does this mean?"

### Travelling Past Fangorn

 lotr_travel_events.0007.desc:0 "As my entourage travels past the edge of the deep and dark Forest of Fangorn, I cannot help but feel uneasy. The locals told us that nobody ever enters the forest, because it is haunted. Suddendly, I am startled - What was that noise? Did those branches just move? I notice that my courtiers seem to be uneasy too, exchanging fearful looks."
 lotr_travel_events.0007.a:0 "Its just a forest! Get a grip."
 lotr_travel_events.0007.a.tt:0 "You are just imaginging things, surely."

 lotr_travel_events.0008.desc.outro:0 "\nHow long have we been travelling through these tunnels? Has it been days? weeks? months? This deep, it is impossible to tell the flow of time.\n\n[caravan_leader.GetFirstName] approaches me: "The darkness seems impenetrable. I hope we can escape this blackened abyss soon."\n[caravan_leader.GetSheHe|U] is most certainly correct. The lack of sunlight is starting to get to me and I find my mind drifting off more and more often. I need some way to distract myself!"
 lotr_travel_events.0008.a:0 "I actually find the darkness rather comforting."
 lotr_travel_events.0008.b:0 "Discretely push [chasm_victim.GetFirstName] into a chasm."
 lotr_travel_events.0008.c:0 "At least this place has some interesting fungi!"
 lotr_travel_events.0008.d:0 "Thoughts of my beloved [beloved.GetFirstName] warm my heart."

 # The Swift and the Stout Men

 lotr_travel_events.0009.tale_stout_men.desc:0 "#italic \"In ancient times, two peoples shared this land. In the plains and forests dwelled the Swift Men, our distant forebears, who could run as fast as the autumn winds. And in the mountains and hills dwelled the Stout Men, who were of small statue and made of rock. In friendship, they made a pact in stone and bronze, carved into the great gate dividing their homelands.\n\nBut one day, a deep, unending fog appeared, from which came forth dark creatures, monsters, and goblins, who sought to destroy both of their realms! Together, the two peoples fought valiantly, and after many great battles, too mighty to recount, they came close to defeating their foes once and for all. But in the final hour before their victory, the monsters smashed the pact-gate.\n\nTheir bond now broken, the Swift Men and the Stout Men began to squabble, and the Stout Men dug themselves deep into the rock, where they began brooding far from the sun. The terrors came upon the Swift Men, who fought valiantly, but eventually had to flee to the fae realm, where the King of Spring and his wife, the Queen of Autumn granted them refuge. The terrors then swarmed unto the Stout Men, destroying their remaining dwellings atop the mountains and driving them deeper and deeper into the earth, until they became one with the rock and disappeared for many centuries.\"#!"

 lotr_travel_events.0009.tale_woodmen_king.desc:0 "#italic \"...is just one of the tales on the origin of the [woodmen_scope.GetName]. Another claims that [tale_character.GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal]'s mother made a pact with the Fae-King of the Woods, who ruled all the trees in the world and was himself a mighty oak, as large as the [mistymountains|E]! She gave him her firstborn child to raise in exchange for wealth and many horses, to feed her starving children. The Fae-King then spoke to [tale_character.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]: 'Thou shall liveth as we do, thy hair shall turn to leaf, and thou shall never die of old age, as long as thou respect the forest and its trees!'\n\nThus he was raised among the fae, drinking their tree-sap for nourishment. He learned to speak the language of the winds, to craft magical tools out of moss and to live in the wood as they do. Over twelve centuries, he sired twelve sons and many more, and he was crowned king of these men. But when his children came of age, they took their axes and began to cut down the trees, who whispered in fear and cried to their king for help. Thus the Fae-King spoke, with a booming voice: 'Thou hath broken our trust and cut down thine elders! For this, I banish thee and thy kin to the edge of the woods for twelve dozen moons!'\n\n[tale_character.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] was devastated, for he realized he had failed to teach his children how to act among the woods. He and his kin moved to the edge of the forest, where he took great care in educating them for twelve moons. But he began to fade and his leaves turned orange and brown. Eventually, he sat down upon a hill in the south, from whence he could see the heart of the woods. Struck with grief, he sprouted roots and remained there, forever whispering his sorrow into the winds. Though he would never know this, the Fae-King had long forgiven him, for his children were moved deeply by his teachings, and had sworn to forever protect the forest and its inhabitants from harm. His descendants still dwell there, now known to us as the [woodmen_scope.GetName] of [mirkwood|E]!\"#!"

 lotr_travel_events.0009.tale_captain_suramir.desc:0 "#italic \"...on his ninth voyage, Captain Sûramir came into a great storm. It blew him far off course, for [storyteller.GetFaith.WaterGodName] held a grudge against him for deflowering his daughter, the fair nymph Kîrmael. Four of his ship were sunk that night, but his flagship, the 'Unreliant', which he had stolen from the Ashen Harbour of the Nereids, prevailed. Its' hull, from bow to stern, was painted with liquid moonlight and was thus unsinkable, for the moon's reflection can't ever sink beneath the waves!\n\nAfter seven days and seven nights, he came upon a strange towering figure, rising from the depths. It was a king's visage, long weathered from the tides, that arose next to his ship from the deep but clear waters, its' stone-carved body submerged below its chin. There, beneath the waves, he saw a great metropolis with large, domed structures, citadels of great beauty and high towers, emerging from further below. He had come upon the great sunken empire of Vanwa Atalantë, where the fish-folk had since ages past dwelled in old splendor.\n\nLong ago, it had been a great and powerful dominion of Men - Until, out of envy, the gods awoke a great water-beast known as the Belraeg, which laid waste to the great realm, before falling asleep upon its corpse - raising the water levels, creating the Belegaer as we know it today. Those few who survived were known as the Atalantëatani, the Sunken Folk, cursed by the gods to become creatures of the deep, never to breathe air again.\n\nCaptain Sûramir knew this, of course, as he had learned the secret knowledge of ages past from the great Craken Tûrmak during his voyage to the ocean beneath the great grottos of Rûrk. His silver eye soon spotted some of the Sunken Folk, bloated and scaly, who were known to drown sailors with their nets, which they threw out beneath the waves. He heroically drew his saber and jumped overboard, eagerly challenging their leader to a duel of wits...\"#!"
