After some time, I eventually come across a colossal wreck - Two vast and trunkless legs of stone stand on a pedestal in the desert.\nNear them, on the sand, half sunk, a shattered visage lies. On the pedestal, these words appear:\n\n#V "MY NAME IS AR-ZÎMANDÂS, KING OF KINGS: LOOK ON MY WORKS, YE MIGHTY, AND DESPAIR!"#!\n\nNothing else remains beside that colossal wreck.

 lotr_travel_events.0002.desc: "Dawn is setting as we make our way through the seemingly endless Dune Sea. Suddenly, I notice the sands beginning to shift a short distance to my left. A smooth, black shell appears, then three pairs of burning red eyes. Two giant pincers and a deadly stinger, large enough to impale a man, arise from the dunes.\n\nJust as I and my companions spring back, a giant scorpion emerges from its hiding spot, raising its claws and chittering angrily. My companions are terrified, why did we choose this path!?"
 lotr_travel_events.0002.desc.again: "The sun is still high in the sky as we continue to make our way through the seemingly endless Dune Sea.

 lotr_travel_events.0003.desc: "As we make our way through the endless ocean of sand, dubbed the "Mirror of Fire" by the locals, we see something strange on the horizon: A great wall seems to stretch across the entire horizon in front of us. No, not a wall... a storm!\n\nPanic breaks out among my people, as we begin to hastily set camp - The Dune Sea is feared for its deathly dust storms known as the 'Breath of Sanbaiz'.

The birds are chirping and we are rather relaxed.\n\nPerhaps I could spend some time relaxing in the woods by myself? They do not seem particularly dangerous, and this could be a good moment to reflect."

 lotr_travel_events.0005.desc: "Soon I am back on the road, although this road is more of an overgrown path, and on my way through Rhosgobel. I spend many hours in the forest, inhabited by an unusually large number of animals and I reflect on my rule and the life behind me.\nEventually I turn back out of the forest and prepare to return to my entourage."
 lotr_travel_events.0005.a: "At least the weather was nice."
 lotr_travel_events.0005.att: "You return to your travel companions"
 
 lotr_travel_events.0006.t: "$travel_event_prefix$ An Encounter in Rhosgobel"
 #lotr_travel_events.0006.desc.intro: "Soon I am back on the road and on my way through Rhosgobel. I spend many hours in the forest, which seems to be house an unusually large number of animals. It is a nice day, though I can only barely make out the sun through the crowns of the trees."
 lotr_travel_events.0006.desc.intro: "I spend many hours in the forest. It is a nice day, though I can only barely make out the sun through the crowns of the trees."
 lotr_travel_events.0006.desc.advice1: " I walk deeper and deeper into the woods, and eventually I realize I have gotten lost. After a while, I encounter a peculiar wanderer, an old man clad in brown garb wearing an unusual hat. He seems to be collecting mushrooms. I greet him and respectfully ask for a way out of the forest. He replies, though he doesn't really seem to pay attention to me:\n\n"Out of the forest? Very simple, just climb up a tree and look around! Ooh, this is a nice one..."\n\nI follow his advice and from the top of the tree I am able to make out the road! When I climb down, I realize he has disappeared and it slowly dawns on me this may have been the [sageofthewoods|E] himself! But did his advice have any deeper meaning?"
 lotr_travel_events.0006.desc.advice2: " As I make my way through a dense bush, I suddenly spot an odd figure, an old man clad in brown garb and wearing an unusual hat, some distance away. He appears to be mumbling at someone else, though I can only make out a few words: \n\n"...there, there, I have enough. Hah! You are a funny one. Yes, perhaps they truly are the pinnacle of creation!"\n\nUpon closer inspection, he appears to be feeding acorns to a large deer. Moments later, he seems to have disappeared between two trees. It slowly dawns on me that this may have been the [sageofthewoods|E] himself! But do his words have any deeper meaning?"
 lotr_travel_events.0006.desc.advice3: " Eventually an old man, clad in brown garb and wearing an unusual hat, appears from the foliage to my right, intending to cross the road. He seems to be upset. As we cross paths he grumbles something vaguely directed at me:\n\n"Ho there! Have you seen my hat? Its a nice hat, very big, but I lost it!" He then lets out a long sigh. "Well, it can't be that far! It'll show up again eventually, always does, so I suppose it's not too bad."\n\nI am too baffled to respond to him and he passes me quickly, going off into the deep woods to my left. It slowly dawns on me that this may have been the [sageofthewoods|E] himself! But do his words have any deeper meaning?" 
 lotr_travel_events.0006.desc.advice4: " Eventually, I come across a large bush of blueberries and decide to rest for a bit. While I am holding my impromptu berry-feast, a peculiar wanderer, an old man clad in brown garb wearing an unusual hat, walks by. He takes a moment to smell the bush, then picks a single berry and puts it into his mouth.\n\n"I like blueberries, but they taste sweetest when you eat them one at a time!"\n\nWith that, he continues to make his way through the forest, soon disappearing between two trees. After I finish my rest, it slowly dawns on me that this may have been the [sageofthewoods|E] himself! But do his words have any deeper meaning?"
 
 lotr_travel_events.0006.b: "I am reading too much into this."
 lotr_travel_events.0006.a: "But what does this mean?"
 lotr_travel_events.0006.att: "You ponder the deeper meaning of the sage advice you have been granted."

 ### Travelling Past Fangorn
 lotr_travel_events.0007.t: "$travel_event_prefix$ The Forest of Fangorn"
 lotr_travel_events.0007.desc: "As my entourage travels past the edge of the deep and dark Forest of Fangorn, I cannot help but feel uneasy. The locals told us that nobody ever enters the forest, because it is haunted. Suddenly, I am startled - What was that noise? Did those branches just move? I notice that my courtiers seem to be uneasy too, exchanging fearful looks."
 lotr_travel_events.0007.a: "It's just a forest! Get a grip."
 lotr_travel_events.0007.a.tt: "You are just imaginging things, surely."

 ### Endless Darkness

 lotr_travel_events.0008.desc.dwarfhold: "Mostly shrouded in darkness, it is hard to admire the works of dwarven masonry that surround us as we cross through their halls."
 lotr_travel_events.0008.desc.caverns: "The labyrinthine caverns seemingly twist endlessly into the dark, offshoots and crevices surrounding us on all sides."
 lotr_travel_events.0008.desc.outro: "\nHow long have we been travelling through these tunnels? Has it been days? weeks? months? This deep, it is impossible to tell the flow of time.\n\n[caravan_leader.GetFirstName] approaches me: "The darkness seems impenetrable. I hope we can escape this blackened abyss soon."\n[caravan_leader.GetSheHe|U] is most certainly correct. The lack of sunlight is starting to get to me and I find my mind drifting off more and more often. I need some way to distract myself!"
 lotr_travel_events.0008.a: "I actually find the darkness rather comforting."
 lotr_travel_events.0008.b: "Discretely push [chasm_victim.GetFirstName] into a chasm."
 lotr_travel_events.0008.c: "At least this place has some interesting fungi!"
 lotr_travel_events.0008.d: "Thoughts of my beloved [beloved.GetFirstName] warm my heart."

 lotr_travel_events.0009.tale_stout_men.desc: "#italic \"In ancient times, two peoples shared this land. In the plains and forests dwelled the Swift Men, our distant forebears, who could run as fast as the autumn winds. And in the mountains and hills dwelled the Stout Men, who were of small statue and made of rock. In friendship, they made a pact in stone and bronze, carved into the great gate dividing their homelands.\n\nBut one day, a deep, unending fog appeared, from which came forth dark creatures, monsters, and goblins, who sought to destroy both of their realms! Together, the two peoples fought valiantly, and after many great battles, too mighty to recount, they came close to defeating their foes once and for all. But in the final hour before their victory, the monsters smashed the pact-gate.\n\nTheir bond now broken, the Swift Men and the Stout Men began to squabble, and the Stout Men dug themselves deep into the rock, where they began brooding far from the sun. The terrors came upon the Swift Men, who fought valiantly, but eventually had to flee to the fae realm, where the King of Spring and his wife, the Queen of Autumn granted them refuge. The terrors then swarmed unto the Stout Men, destroying their remaining dwellings atop the mountains and driving them deeper and deeper into the earth, until they became one with the rock and disappeared for many centuries.\"#!"

 lotr_travel_events.0009.tale_woodmen_king.desc: "#italic \"...is just one of the tales on the origin of the [woodmen_scope.GetName]. Another claims that [tale_character_center.GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal]'s mother made a pact with the Fae-King of the Woods, who ruled all the trees in the world and was himself a mighty oak, as large as the [mistymountains|E]! She gave him her firstborn child to raise in exchange for wealth and many horses, to feed her starving children. The Fae-King then spoke to [tale_character_center.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]: 'Thou shall liveth as we do, thy hair shall turn to leaf, and thou shall never die of old age, as long as thou respect the forest and its trees!'\n\nThus he was raised among the fae, drinking their tree-sap for nourishment. He learned to speak the language of the winds, to craft magical tools out of moss and to live in the wood as they do. Over twelve centuries, he sired twelve sons and many more, and he was crowned king of these men. But when his children came of age, they took their axes and began to cut down the trees, who whispered in fear and cried to their king for help. Thus the Fae-King spoke, with a booming voice: 'Thou hath broken our trust and cut down thine elders! For this, I banish thee and thy kin to the edge of the woods for twelve dozen moons!'\n\n[tale_character_center.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] was devastated, for he realized he had failed to teach his children how to act among the woods. He and his kin moved to the edge of the forest, where he took great care in educating them for twelve moons. But he began to fade and his leaves turned orange and brown. Eventually, he sat down upon a hill in the south, from whence he could see the heart of the woods. Struck with grief, he sprouted roots and remained there, forever whispering his sorrow into the winds. Though he would never know this, the Fae-King had long forgiven him, for his children were moved deeply by his teachings, and had sworn to forever protect the forest and its inhabitants from harm. His descendants still dwell there, now known to us as the [woodmen_scope.GetName] of [mirkwood|E]!\"#!"

 lotr_travel_events.0009.tale_captain_suramir.desc: "#italic \"...on his ninth voyage, Captain Sûramir came into a great storm. It blew him far off course, for [storyteller.GetFaith.WaterGodName] held a grudge against him for deflowering his daughter, the fair nymph Kîrmael. Four of his ship were sunk that night, but his flagship, the 'Unreliant', which he had stolen from the Ashen Harbour of the Nereids, prevailed. Its' hull, from bow to stern, was painted with liquid moonlight and was thus unsinkable, for the moon's reflection can't ever sink beneath the waves!\n\nAfter seven days and seven nights, he came upon a strange towering figure, rising from the depths. It was a king's visage, long weathered from the tides, that arose next to his ship from the deep but clear waters, its' stone-carved body submerged below its chin. There, beneath the waves, he saw a great metropolis with large, domed structures, citadels of great beauty and high towers, emerging from further below. He had come upon the great sunken empire of Vanwa Atalantë, where the fish-folk had since ages past dwelled in old splendor.\n\nLong ago, it had been a great and powerful dominion of Men - Until, out of envy, the gods awoke a great water-beast known as the Belraeg, which laid waste to the great realm, before falling asleep upon its corpse - raising the water levels, creating the Belegaer as we know it today. Those few who survived were known as the Atalantëatani, the Sunken Folk, cursed by the gods to become creatures of the deep, never to breathe air again.\n\nCaptain Sûramir knew this, of course, as he had learned the secret knowledge of ages past from the great Craken Tûrmak during his voyage to the ocean beneath the great grottos of Rûrk. His silver eye soon spotted some of the Sunken Folk, bloated and scaly, who were known to drown sailors with their nets, which they threw out beneath the waves. He heroically drew his saber and jumped overboard, eagerly challenging their leader to a duel of wits...\"#!"
 
 lotr_travel_events.0009.tale_weeping_pass.t: "The Battle of the Weeping Pass" #by Juke
 lotr_travel_events.0009.tale_weeping_pass.desc: "#italic \"Let me recount the Battle of the Weeping Pass next. Hear that at this time, [khand|E] was contested by several warlords, some of which had entered into an alliance under [tale_character_left.GetFirstNameNicknamed], who had consolidated a large part of [GetTitleByKey('k_upper_khand').GetNameNoTier] under his realm. He was opposed by [tale_character_right.GetFirstNameNicknamed], who had earned a reputation as a cunning mercenary during his time as captain of the company known as the Middle Army. These two gathered their hosts near [GetTitleByKey('b_obamarl').GetNameNoTier]. [tale_character_left.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] had gained the support of [tale_character_center.GetFirstNameNicknamed], as well as several minor lords, two mercenary warbands known as the 'Reckless Sons' and the 'Blood-Drunk Host' and a sizeable number of [igath_scope.GetName] Auxiliaries. [tale_character_right.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] was outnumbered three to one, but his warriors were much better experienced, having skirmished with the [chelkari_scope.GetName] for much of their life. It was also said they could outrun a heavy charriot on foot.\n\nThe battle was finally opened by [tale_character_left.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], who ordered his warriors to charge their enemy, hoping to simply overpower them with their superior numbers. Immediately, the thundering sound of thousands of warriors charging into battle reverberated through the gap. [tale_character_right.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] had of course hoped for this, and sacrificed twenty eagles the week prior in hopes of gaining the favor of Tûmrakhi. The ground had become wet and unsturdy from the ensuing rain, and with a gushing sound like that of an opened wound, a great part of the muddied terrain began to come loose and slide down, causing the charge to falter and the men to stumble and fall. [tale_character_right.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] then dissolved his formation, and his lightly armored veterans, some on horseback, descended upon their enemies in a bloody dance of death, sowing death wherever they came. While his commanders were trying to restore order among the now panicked soldiers, [tale_character_left.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] was forced to bring his reserve units in early, so that the men at the front could not flee from battle.\n\nHowever, [tale_character_left.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] had not anticipated the enemy within. [tale_character_center.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], sensing that the battle was lost, betrayed him alongside what remained of the Blood-Drunk Host. Four hours later, [tale_character_left.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]'s head and spine were presented to [tale_character_right.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] and a pact was signed. Eighteen Thousand men lied dead in the mud, and the Gap's sands are still red from their blood today. [tale_character_left.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]'s domain was carved up by his enemies, with [tale_character_center.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] absorbing the  remaining clans into his own realm. So young warriors, heed my warning: Favorable terrain and devotion to the gods goes a long way in securing victory!

Razarac, 'Drought-Bringer', the old tribes called it. For wherever it came, it brought pain and destruction. Its' breath unleashed droughts and its' gaze drained oases. It was cursed by the gods with unending thirst, never to be sated. So it sought out life where it could, to drain the springs and rivers of [harad|E]. A great many tribes were sundered until the Windlord heard the peoples' cries and chose a champion, brave and resolute, to face the demon. His champion's name was Tarik and he was a legendary swordsman - In combat, he wielded three scimitars, and no foe had ever escaped his blade. Blessed by the Windlord with unending resolve, he set out to face the creature and to bring it to ruin, guided by a great eagle along his path. After many days of travel, he finally found Razarac in the ruins of a great city. Mere days ago it was a bustling metropolis, now ruined by its' evil.\n\n'Face me, Destroyer!', called Tarek, for he was a man of few words and many blades. Razarac glared at him with disgust and silence, for its throat had long dried out and it was unable to speak. A great battle ensued, and Tarek swiftly engaged his foe,  cutting his foe with blades swift as the wind. They fought fiercely, from dawn to dusk and dusk to dawn. The demon struck with the might of earth and thunder and it's hide was fierce and coarse as sand. But Tarek's strikes were quick, precise, and, like a scorpion's, always found a weak spot. Eventually, he had worn down Razarac enough to land a finishing blow. He felled it and pierced it's foul heart, destroying its mortal form. But the creature was cunning and with its last rattling breath, whispered it's spirit into the sandy winds, where he knew no mortal could harm it.\n\nBut the Windlord had seen this coming and had his eagle whisper the true name of the winds into Tarek's ear, allowing him to pursue the demon. And so, wherever Razarac's vile spirit rests to regain his strength, Tarek is sure to soon follow and engage in combat once more in a great cycle. Their divine duels appear to us as the great sandstorms that bring drought and destruction. They are fiercest in the dunes where Razarac's form was felled, in the eternal battlefield now known as the Dune Sea, as the Mirror of Fire.\"#!"

Born in the hills of [GetTitleByKey('d_briy_miyesec').GetNameNoTier], he was once a simple goatherder, like some of you, a shepherd providing for his tribe in those days. During his nineteenth year, while he slept beneath the bright sky and the full moon, he had a vague strange dream: He saw a flame, searingly hot and yet bitterly cold, threatening to burn a palm tree.\n\nHe thought little of it until a full cycle later, he had the same dream, clearer this time, whilst once again sleeping under the starry moonlit sky: He saw a fiery figure,  inconceivably dark and yet blindingly bright, laying waste to a beautiful garden.\n\nFinally, after another cycle had passed, he received his third and final vision, his purpose made clear: He saw the sun god Vâtra, inconceivably powerful and yet momentarily vulnerable, despoiling the lands of [farharad|E] with his presence. It was then that Ladnôca, moon goddess,  spouse of Vâtra, and caring mother of mankind, revealed herself to him: The words she chose are known only to Iunást, but her voice is said to have been so beautiful that once he awoke, he found himself resting in a blooming field of flowers. His purpose was made clear: He had to travel to the Land of the Sun, where Vâtra was attempting to channel his terrible strength into a physical avatar. While it was forming there, it was still vulnerable, and so perhaps his plan to could still be prevented.\n\nThe following day, Iunást told his tribe of the divine mission he had received from the goddess. Gatara, who was in those days already a well known seer and mystic, quickly proclaimed that he would accompany his childhood friend on his arduous journey north. In total twelve of his tribe, his closest friends, chose to accompany him on his travels. Yet only one of them would return to tell the tale...\"#!"

The land was rich and lush, and the dowry yet unsundered. Each of these clans built their dwellings from the gifts they had received: bone, gold, copper, jewels, bronze, and spice.\n\nAll was good for twenty cycles and six, but eventually, disaster brewed. Rumors reached through the Dâr road, rumors of a great flood far in the west, and that the Isle of Restless Winds had been swallowed by the elements. This was terrible, as the Isle was known in these days as the home of a great many wind spirits, which had been terribly upset. The wind spirits thus rode the eastward currents, until they came upon the rain men, a people that dwelt at those shores, whom they mantled. Some even fled into the Bay, where they sought refuge and warned the clans of their wrathful kin in the west.\n\nThe rain men, wrathful and upset, had become the storm men, an unkind folk of baleful temperament. That spring, they blew east across the mountains into Sîrayn, where the clans were given little time to prepare. When the storm fell upon them, they could do little but pray to the gods and seek shelter in their homes. In its blind rage, the ravenous storm first fell upon the warlike among them, destroying their houses of bone. The prideful among them, who'd built their homes of jewels and precious metals, were devoured next, though they too fought bravely. Finally, the storm fell upon the last clan, those who built their home out of spice. But when it tore apart their dwelling, preparing to devour them as well, the winds took in their spices, and they quickly spread throughout the storm. The storm men, utterly unprepared, all began to sneeze violently. Their assault quickly collapsed, causing the storm men, who had never tasted something so intense, to flee.\n\nNow it was the storm's turn to fall. The clan celebrated with a great feast, and then decided to act quickly - They set out in great caravans, and spread their gifts to all the peoples of the world. Everywhere they came, the people welcomed them, for they too had been plagued by thunder, wind, and lightning. After three cycles, the world was freed, and the gods were pleased. Yet now that they were sharing their spices with the world, they had not enough left to build themselves a home.

But some men were angry, and demanded the gods grant them better lands, more lush and richer in jewels and silver. In their wisdom, the Gods elected to fulfill their request, seeking to teach them humility.

At once, the mist cleared and Alrúz was apalled to see what was transpiring under his watch. He sent his flock to the mainland, alongs with the few men still loyal to the gods. Then Eagle and Dragon fought, and in the frenzy of their struggle the isle, already crumbling under the weight of the Sea-Peoples' treasure, finally collapsed, drowning the evil men that had corrupted it in an act of divine punishment.\"#!"

 lotr_travel_events.0504.b: "The sun sets every night, time to move!"

 lotr_travel_events.0505.t: "$travel_event_prefix$ The Straggler"
 lotr_travel_events.0505.desc: "We are passing along a remote road in the [ROOT.Char.GetCurrentLocation.GetTerrain.GetNameNoTooltip] of [location.GetName], and for a while we have descried no fellow travellers. Yet as the sun reaches its peak in the sky and it grows hot, one of my companions spots far ahead a bedraggled man limping forward. As soon as he spots us, he rushes forth, begging for help.\n\n"Please, help me! I was part of a caravan, but got lost some time ago, and for days I've had but a few scraps of food and drops of water. Please, have a heart!" Before we can speak, his eyes widen in terror, and he falls to his knees. "You're Elves! Oh no, oh no, please don't put a curse on me! I have a family!" He is evidently considering whether to make a run for it."
 lotr_travel_events.0505.a: "Out of our way."
 lotr_travel_events.0505.b: "Here, have some food and water at least."
 lotr_travel_events.0505.c: "Join us, you'll have food, water, and safety at least."

 lotr_travel_events.0506.t: "$travel_event_prefix$ A Realization"
 lotr_travel_events.0506.desc: "It has been a long, dready week of travel, and as dusk approaches I stop off at a flowing river to bathe. The water is cool and refreshing, and I feel myself relax as the dust washes off, and I hear the melody of the water babbling over rocks and pebbles. I open my eyes, and a realization enters my mind.\n\nAll this toil and weariness has made these happy and peaceful moments all the sweeter. Often I think of departing [middleearth|E], departing all worries and hurts and resting in the light of the [valargods|E]. What a sweet draught that would be! But what good is sweetness if you cannot taste sourness? What good is peace if you do not know the alternative? How can one rest when one does not know weariness?"
 lotr_travel_events.0506.a: "The One shall reward our toils, I am sure of this now."
