 ### A Colossal Wreck ###
 lotr_travel_events.0001.t:0 "$travel_event_prefix$ A Colossal Wreck"
 lotr_travel_events.0001.desc:0 "As we make our way through the [ROOT.Char.GetCurrentLocation.GetTerrain.GetNameNoTooltip|l] of [ROOT.Char.GetCurrentLocation.GetNameNoTooltip], I find myself falling behind the rest of the group. After some time, I eventually come across a colossal wreck - Two vast and trunkless legs of stone stand on a pedestal in the desert.\nNear them, on the sand, half sunk, a shattered visage lies. On the pedestal, these words appear:\n\n#V "MY NAME IS AR-ZÎMANDÂS, KING OF KINGS: LOOK ON MY WORKS, YE MIGHTY, AND DESPAIR!"#!\n\nNothing else remains beside that colossal wreck. The lone and level sands stretch far away."

 ### Giant Scorpion Attack ###
 lotr_travel_events.0002.t:0 "$travel_danger_prefix$ Giant Scorpion Attack"
 lotr_travel_events.0002.desc:0 "Dawn is setting as we make our way through the seemingly endless Dune Sea. Suddendly, I notice the sands beginning to shift a short distance to my left. A smooth, black shell appears, then three pairs of burning red eyes. Two giant pincers and a deadly stinger, large enough to impale a man, arise from the dunes.\n\nJust as I and my companions spring back, a giant scorpion emerges from its hiding spot, raising its claws and chittering angrily. My companions are terrified, why did we choose this path!?"
 lotr_travel_events.0002.desc.again:0 "The sun is still high in the sky as we continue to make our way through the seemingly endless Dune Sea. Suddendly, I notice the sands beginning to shift a short distance to my right, with some now oh-so familiar chittering sounds.\n\nThis time, three giant scorpions burst from the sands, giant pincers clacking and with deadly stingers large enough to impale a man. These things must really hold a grudge!"
 lotr_travel_events.0002.desc.victim:0 "\n\n#EMP "WATCH OUT!"#!, [beast_victim.GetFirstName] yells, raising his spear towards the monstrous foe."

 ### Sandstorm! ###
 lotr_travel_events.0003.t:1 "$travel_danger_prefix$ Sandstorm!"
 lotr_travel_events.0003.desc:0 "As we make our way through the endless ocean of sand, dubbed the "Mirror of Fire" by the locals, we see something strange on the horizon: A great wall seems to stretch across the entire horizon in front of us. No, not a wall... a storm!\n\nPanic breaks out among my people, as we begin to hastily set camp - The Dune Sea is feared for its deathly dust storms known as the 'Breath of Sanbaiz'. I fear I shall not live to see another day if I try to survive on luck alone."
 lotr_travel_events.0003.a:0 "Our guide is organizing our camp! I will be fine."

 ### Encounter in Rhosgobel
 lotr_travel_events.0004.t:0 "$travel_event_prefix$ The Woods of Rhosgobel"
 lotr_travel_events.0004.desc:0 "Today, my entourage makes their way past the woods of Rhosgobel. The birds are chirping and we are rather relaxed.\n\nPerhaps I could spend some time relaxing in the woods by myself? They do not seem particularly dangerous, and this could be a good moment to reflect."
 lotr_travel_events.0004.desc.sage:0 " Who knows, I may even stumble upon the [sageofthewoods|E]!"
 lotr_travel_events.0004.a:0 "No time! We move on swiftly, folks."
 lotr_travel_events.0004.b:0 "Some time in the woods will help me clear my mind."
 lotr_travel_events.0004.btt:0 "You decide to spend some time strolling through the woods of Rhosgobel, with a chance to stumble upon the [sageofthewoods|E]."
 
 lotr_travel_events.0005.t:0 "$travel_event_prefix$ Nothing but Brambles and Bark"
 lotr_travel_events.0005.desc:0 "Soon I am back on the road, although this road is more of an overgrown path, and on my way through Rhosgobel. I spend many hours in the forest, inhabited by an unusually large number of animals and I reflect on my rule and the life behind me.\nEventually I turn back out of the forest and prepare to return to my entourage."
 lotr_travel_events.0005.a:0 "At least the weather was nice."
 lotr_travel_events.0005.att:0 "You return to your travel companions"
 
 lotr_travel_events.0006.t:0 "$travel_event_prefix$ An Encounter in Rhosgobel"
 #lotr_travel_events.0006.desc.intro:0 "Soon I am back on the road and on my way through Rhosgobel. I spend many hours in the forest, which seems to be house an unusually large number of animals. It is a nice day, though I can only barely make out the sun through the crowns of the trees."
 lotr_travel_events.0006.desc.intro:0 "I spend many hours in the forest. It is a nice day, though I can only barely make out the sun through the crowns of the trees."
 lotr_travel_events.0006.desc.advice1:0 " I walk deeper and deeper into the woods, and eventually I realize I have gotten lost. After a while, I encounter a peculiar wanderer, an old man clad in brown garb wearing an unusual hat. He seems to be collecting mushrooms. I greet him and respectfully ask for a way out of the forest. He replies, though he doesn't really seem to pay attention to me:\n\n"Out of the forest? Very simple, just climb up a tree and look around! Ooh, this is a nice one..."\n\nI follow his advice and from the top of the tree I am able to make out the road! When I climb down, I realize he has disappeared and it slowly dawns on me this may have been the [sageofthewoods|E] himself! But did his advice have any deeper meaning?"
 lotr_travel_events.0006.desc.advice2:0 " As I make my way through a dense bush, I suddenly spot an odd figure, an old man clad in brown garb and wearing an unusual hat, some distance away. He appears to be mumbling at someone else, though I can only make out a few words: \n\n"...there, there, I have enough. Hah! You are a funny one. Yes, perhaps they truly are the pinnacle of creation!"\n\nUpon closer inspection, he appears to be feeding acorns to a large deer. Moments later, he seems to have disappeared between two trees. It slowly dawns on me that this may have been the [sageofthewoods|E] himself! But do his words have any deeper meaning?"
 lotr_travel_events.0006.desc.advice3:0 " Eventually an old man, clad in brown garb and wearing an unusual hat, appears from the foliage to my right, intending to cross the road. He seems to be upset. As we cross paths he grumbles something vaguely directed at me:\n\n"Ho there! Have you seen my hat? Its a nice hat, very big, but I lost it!" He then lets out a long sigh. "Well, it can't be that far! It'll show up again eventually, always does, so I suppose it's not too bad."\n\nI am too baffled to respond to him and he passes me quickly, going off into the deep woods to my left. It slowly dawns on me that this may have been the [sageofthewoods|E] himself! But do his words have any deeper meaning?" 
 lotr_travel_events.0006.desc.advice4:0 " Eventually, I come across a large bush of blueberries and decide to rest for a bit. While I am holding my impromptu berry-feast, a peculiar wanderer, an old man clad in brown garb wearing an unusual hat, walks by. He takes a moment to smell the bush, then picks a single berry and puts it into his mouth.\n\n"I like blueberries, but they taste sweetest when you eat them one at a time!"\n\nWith that, he continues to make his way through the forest, soon disappearing between two trees. After I finish my rest, it slowly dawns on me that this may have been the [sageofthewoods|E] himself! But do his words have any deeper meaning?"
 
 lotr_travel_events.0006.b:0 "I am reading too much into this."
 lotr_travel_events.0006.a:0 "But what does this mean?"
 lotr_travel_events.0006.att:0 "You ponder the deeper meaning of the sage advice you have been granted."
 lotr_travel_events.0006.a.success:0 "You successfully interpret his sage advice"
 lotr_travel_events.0006.a.failure:0 "You fail to interpret his strange ramblings"

### Travelling Past Fangorn
lotr_travel_events.0007.t:0 "$travel_event_prefix$ The Forest of Fangorn"
lotr_travel_events.0007.desc:0 "As my entourage travels past the edge of the deep and dark Forest of Fangorn, I cannot help but feel uneasy. The locals told us that nobody ever enters the forest, because it is haunted. Suddendly, I am startled - What was that noise? Did those branches just move? I notice that my courtiers seem to be uneasy too, exchanging fearful looks."
lotr_travel_events.0007.a:0 "Its just a forest! Get a grip."
lotr_travel_events.0007.a.tt:0 "You are just imaginging things, surely."
lotr_travel_events.0007.b:0 "We should take a detour..."
lotr_travel_events.0007.b.tt:0 "You order your entourage to take a detour, to travel further away from the edge of the forest."
