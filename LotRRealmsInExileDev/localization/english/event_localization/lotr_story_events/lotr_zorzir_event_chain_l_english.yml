 zorzir_event_chain.0100.t: "Setting up Camp"
 zorzir_event_chain.0100.desc: "It is settled then, the battle for Mablâd-dûm will continue.\n\nNevertheless, [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofvarakh101').GetName] urges caution. In our current position, we are mere miles from the site of our last defeat. If the [orcs|E] were to return, we would be sitting moles. Returning scouts say that they have found evidence of an old [blacklock|E] survey outpost in a cave further south. It is well-supplied, and well-hidden. Such a site could be transformed into a formidable base camp, far from prying eyes.\n\nThis plan is not without its detractors, however. [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofthanul83').GetName] cries that such a move would abandon any lost [dwarves|E] making their way to us. If we remain close by to the battlefield, we will find more survivors."
 zorzir_event_chain.0100.a: "We will not abandon our brothers! Here we shall stay."
 zorzir_event_chain.0100.b: "Remaining here is a death sentence. We march for the survey outpost."

 zorzir_event_chain.0200.t: "The Missing Expeditionaries"
 zorzir_event_chain.0200.desc: "As our battle-line crumbled against the [orcish|E] assault, our forces were split into four groups. Though the bulk made their way here, three captains and their companies were lost.\n\nWe must find our brothers and bring them back, no matter the cost."
 zorzir_event_chain.0200.a: "We will find them!"
 zorzir_event_chain.0200.b: "One down, two to go."
 zorzir_event_chain.0200.c: "One captain remains."
 zorzir_event_chain.0200.d: "What news of the last captain?"
 
 
 zorzir_event_chain.0300.t: "Expedition in Despair"
 zorzir_event_chain.0300.desc: "We have scarcely departed when unsettling murmurs reach my ears. My companions whisper that it is hopeless, that none of the other companies have survived.\n\nThey darken the mood with grotesque speculation as to the captains' fates. They say that we will be lucky to find even their broken bodies."
 zorzir_event_chain.0300.a: "Hopeless? It is never hopeless!"
 zorzir_event_chain.0300.b: "They are [axesofnargubraz|E]. We do not break so easily."
 zorzir_event_chain.0300.c: "In my heart, I fear they are right."
 
 zorzir_event_chain.0310.t: "Spoiled Supplies"
 zorzir_event_chain.0310.desc: "Ill news from the porter: some foul rot in the air here has seeped into the food supply, rendering it all but inedible. Here, deep behind enemy lines, we cannot simply procure more at a local settlement.\n\nThough we are hardy enough to survive on meager rations, the incessant groaning of your dwarves is irritating enough to demand a solution."
 zorzir_event_chain.0310.a: "There must be something to hunt down here."
 zorzir_event_chain.0310.b: "Organize a team of foragers." 
 zorzir_event_chain.0310.c: "We have already prepared for this! Bring up the reserve supplies." 
 
 zorzir_event_chain.0320.t: "Tormog's Troubles"
 zorzir_event_chain.0320.desc: "I am awoken to cheers. A dozen-odd survivors have found their way to our camp and are being given a proper [dwarven|E] welcome.\n\nAmong them is my lost captain [tormog.GetFirstName]. He explains that his company, several hundred strong, are trapped in a nearby tunnel, blocked in by thick webbing and hunted relentlessly by spiders.\n\nHe pleads for our aid and swears to rejoin the mission if they are rescued."
 zorzir_event_chain.0320.a: "Spiders, eh? They are no match for us."
 zorzir_event_chain.0320.b: "Bring up the engineers. We'll cut through those webs in no time." 
 zorzir_event_chain.0320.c: "You must lure the spiders away Tormog, it is the only way."
 tormog_troops: "Tormog's Battalion"
 
 zorzir_event_chain.0400.t: "KHROATOAN"
 zorzir_event_chain.0400.desc: "Not but a few days pass before we pick up the trail.\n\n We have discovered the remnants of a dwarven camp, freshly abandoned. Though empty, it does not look like the dwarves here left under duress. There are no signs of battle and the previous occupants left the campsite neatly packed.\n\nThere is one oddity, however. Carved into a makeshift palisade is a single word, written in [cirth|E] runes. It reads: 'KHROATOAN'.\n\nThis is no [khuzdul|E] word, nor [adunaic|E]. Is it a place? The name of a people or tribe? Surely this is a clue..."
 zorzir_event_chain.0400.a: "Ah! I know just what this means."
 zorzir_event_chain.0400.b: "There must be other clues that we are missing..." 
 zorzir_event_chain.0400.c: "This is a petty distraction."
 
 zorzir_event_chain.0410.t: "Goblin Patrols"
 zorzir_event_chain.0410.desc: "Our company comes upon a pass, guarded by a [goblin|E] patrol. Their numbers are few, but they carry drums and horns- no doubt for signalling reinforcements.\n\nWe could destroy them easily enough, but a brazen assault could risk alerting every [orc|E] in the area."
 zorzir_event_chain.0410.a: "We'll organize an ambush. They'll be dead before a horn reaches their lips."
 zorzir_event_chain.0410.b: "We can sneak past them." 
 zorzir_event_chain.0410.c: "They won't sound the alarm for a single dwarf. I will face them alone."
 
 zorzir_event_chain.0420.t: "The Treason of Khibilun"
 zorzir_event_chain.0420.desc: "Wind whips through my beard as I stand atop the cliffs of [GetTitleByKey('c_fhul').GetNameNoTier]. Behind me, the broken spires and orc-swarmed passes of [GetTitleByKey('c_tul_askar').GetNameNoTier]. Before me, my lost captain [khibilun.GetFirstName], gazing out at the green pastures of [GetTitleByKey('e_sirayn').GetNameNoTier]. His company stands by, some five hundred strong, awaiting his command.\n\n'We were not ready...' He pauses, for a moment, weighing the situation. 'Why should we sacrifice so much for a heap of molten slag? Are there not other lands that we may liberate from the Shadow? I will not fight and die in some dark hole when I could grow rich in green and fertile country.'"
 zorzir_event_chain.0420.a: "You swore an oath, Khibilun, to fight alongside your brothers."
 zorzir_event_chain.0420.b: "You will find me a more bitter foe than [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineoflughasya23').GetFirstName]."
 zorzir_event_chain.0420.c: "Let any leave that wish to."

 zorzir_event_chain.0500.t: "Hunted in the Dark"
 zorzir_event_chain.0500.desc: "Our final expedition is met with immediate resistance. [orcish|E] saboteurs dog us at every turn, quickly striking out to burn supplies, before slinking back into the darkness. Though they have not yet attacked us outright, it is only a matter of time before they escalate.\n\nMy companions urge me to pursue the orcs when next they strike, but I worry at the possibility of a trap."
 zorzir_event_chain.0500.a: "Trap be damned, we will have their heads!"
 zorzir_event_chain.0500.b: "Perhaps we should lay a trap of our own..." 
 zorzir_event_chain.0500.c: "Cover our tracks, we'll lose them in the tunnels."
 
 zorzir_event_chain.0510.t: "Axes Besieged"
 zorzir_event_chain.0510.desc: "The sounds of pitched battle draw us to the ruins of an old [blacklock|E] aqueduct. Arrows soar through smoke-choked air as blasting powder ignites all around us. A battalion of [axesofnargubraz|E] hold the bridge against a horde of [orcs|E].\n\nThe orcs are far too numerous for us to take with the few companions I've brought. We'll need to be creative to save our allies."
 zorzir_event_chain.0510.a: "Signal for the [dwarves|E] to retreat- we'll collapse the aqueduct behind them."
 zorzir_event_chain.0510.b: "These orcs are superstitious. Let us frighten them with a bad omen." 
 zorzir_event_chain.0510.c: "I may not be able to defeat the orcs, but I can buy our dwarves time to escape!"

 zorzir_event_chain.0520.t: "A Fallen Son of the Axe"
 zorzir_event_chain.0520.desc: "As the battle rages, I am brought face-to-face with the leader of the [orcs|E], [boss_orc.GetFirstNameNicknamed]. 'Behold, [blacklock|E], I bring you a gift, a token from our last battle together!' The orc tosses a bloody sack at your feet.\n\nInside, you see the severed head of the third lost captain, your prince, [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('thirdlineofthrar89').GetName]."
 zorzir_event_chain.0520.a: "You will pay for this."
 zorzir_event_chain.0520.b: "[boss_orc.GetFirstName] will rue this day." 
 zorzir_event_chain.0520.a.tt: "Duel [boss_orc.GetFirstName] to the death."
 
 zorzir_event_chain.0522.t: "A Host Reforged"
 zorzir_event_chain.0522.desc: "[boss_orc.GetFirstNameNicknamed] falls to the floor, defeated. With a final swing of my sword, he is dispatched. What [orcs|E] survive wail and flee, hurling curses as they go.\n\nThough we are victorious, this is only the beginning of our war. We have lost one brother, but we have gained many more. With all captains accounted for, we must ready ourselves to strike [GetTitleByKey('k_mablad_dum').GetNameNoTier] proper."
 zorzir_event_chain.0522.a: "For [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('thirdlineofthrar89').GetName]!"
 
 zorzir_event_chain.0523.t: "The First of Many"
 zorzir_event_chain.0523.desc: "In the chaos of the ensuing battle, [boss_orc.GetFirstName] disappears. What [orcs|E] survive wail and flee, hurling curses as they go.\n\nThough we are victorious, this is only the beginning of our war. We have lost one brother, but we have gained many more. With all captains accounted for, we must ready ourselves to strike [GetTitleByKey('k_mablad_dum').GetNameNoTier] proper."

 zorzir_event_chain.0524.a: "Avenge me, brothers!"
 
 zorzir_event_chain.0530.t: "The Last Captain"
 zorzir_event_chain.0530.desc: "Scouts report that the third lost captain, [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('thirdlineofthrar89').GetName], has been found in [GetTitleByKey('c_medandushathur').GetNameNoTier]. He did not survive.\n\nWe have lost one brother, but we have gained many more. With all captains accounted for, we must consolidate [GetTitleByKey('k_mablad_dum').GetNameNoTier] proper."

zorzir_event_chain.0600.desc: "At last, at long last, [GetTitleByKey('k_mablad_dum').GetNameNoTier] is in [blacklock|E] hands once more.\n\nSimply holding the land was not enough to convince the [dwarven|E] world of our success. Many centuries have passed since our kind last set foot in these halls, and with them many tragic failures. Millenia of disappointment had made cold their hearts, and so they called us mercenaries and zealots. It was necessary that we prove, unquestionably, that we were the masters of this realm.\n\nNow, there is no doubt. The [axesofnargubraz|E] hold every symbol of power.\n\nBy ancient right, Mablâd-dûm belongs to House [adunabar.GetDynastyHouseName], and we are duty-bound to return it to them. Regardless, I cannot help but reflect on our journey to this point. It was not [adunabar.GetFirstName] that fought, and bled, for this hold, but the [GetTitleByKey('d_zorzirs_expedition').GetNameNoTier]! If we wished to keep Mablâd-dûm as a war-mansion, what could [adunabar.GetSheHe] do to stop us?"
zorzir_event_chain.0600.a: "We fight in the name of House [adunabar.GetDynastyHouseName]."
zorzir_event_chain.0600.b: "It is ours, and ours alone."
zorzir_event_chain.0600.a.tt_1: "Transfer all held titles to the ruler of [GetTitleByKey('k_thrars_folk').GetNameNoTier]"

zorzir_event_chain.0601.desc: "Though the world outside roils in chaos, within the Yellow Mountains, all is right. With [GetTitleByKey('k_mablad_dum').GetNameNoTier] returned to its rightful owner, I am able to rest for the first time in a long time.\n\nAlas, my spirit is not one to stay idle, and it is not long before my mind is filled with fanciful visions of far off lands, and futures that might have been.\n\nI think of [adunabar.GetFirstName], and the challenges that he will face in restoring these halls, but I dream also of Shadow-shrouded jungles, and tall distant peaks, waiting for braving blades to claim them."
zorzir_event_chain.0601.a: "[adunabar.GetFirstName] will bring glory to our people."
