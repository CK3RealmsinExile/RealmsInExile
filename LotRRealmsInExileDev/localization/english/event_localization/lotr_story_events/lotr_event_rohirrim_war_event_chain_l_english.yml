Suddenly, he lets out a booming laugh, his grin widening into something unnerving. “A marriage and an alliance, you say? And what, pray, makes you think you deserve such gifts?”\n\nBefore I can answer, he stands abruptly, pacing with a heavy tread. “The mountains demand more than words,” he says, gesturing grandly toward the peaks visible through the open doorway. “They demand endurance, strength, and favour with the gods who rule these heights.”\n\nHe stops and points a massive finger at me, his grin sharp. “Prove yourself, boy. Survive the snowy peaks alone. No provisions, no weapons, no comforts. Strip yourself bare and face the mountain as the gods intended. Return alive, and I will grant you my daughter’s hand and my support. Fail, and…” He chuckles darkly, “well, my men will see you safely home. Or whatever is left of you.”\n\nA murmur of discontent ripples through my men, their unease plain."

My bare skin burns with every gust, but I find warmth in motion, refusing to let the cold claim me. I chew on strips of bark and frozen moss, their bitterness sharp on my tongue, to keep hunger at bay.\n\nMy thoughts wander as exhaustion sets in. I picture the Mountainfather’s mocking grin and the suspicious stares of his men. These visions fuel my resolve. This ordeal is not for glory or pride - it is for survival, for power, for the throne that must be mine.\n\nOn the third day, the peaks seem less cruel.

If I remain, I will die.\n\nI force myself to my feet, staggering back in the direction of the hall. Each step is an agony, each breath a rasp.

What was all this for? Vengeance? Or was it pride, the same blind hubris that led my father to his death? I think of Helm Hammerhand, the man who took everything from me, and wonder if he would laugh to see me now - broken and alone on the side of a mountain, all for the hand of a child and the chance of power.\n\nThe snow falls gently, the wind howls softly, and I let my eyes close as a white blanket falls over me."

The flicker of a smirk touching his lips. “We both know what’s at stake. I won’t pretend this is without risk, for either of us! But if you’re bold enough to make this move, then I’ll be bold enough to follow.”\n\nOur hands clasp firmly and the deal is done. A secret alliance forged in ambition, and perhaps necessity.\n\nAs the firelight flickers, Thorne nods once, a final gesture of resolve. “When the banners are raised, send word. The Wold will march with you.”"

Helm would show me no mercy if this failed. I’ve no intention of seeing my bloodline wiped out for a gamble, no matter how bold it may be.”\n\nHe turns, the faintest hint of regret in his expression, and starts for the edge of the outpost. My mind races as I watch him leave, his words echoing in my ears. He knows my plans now... my intent to claim Rohan, to take what is mine.\n\nIf he speaks of this to the wrong ears, it could ruin everything. Worse, it could bring Helm’s wrath down on me before I’m ready. The question hangs like a blade in the air: do I let him go and risk it, or silence him before it’s too late?"

A second swing ends it, the axe splitting his chest with a sickening crack. His dagger clatters to the ground as he collapses, gasping for breath that will never return.\n\nAll falls silent save for my ragged breathing.

Pain blossoms, sharp and unbearable, as I fall to my knees.\n\nThorne stands over me, his breathing steady, the dagger dripping with my blood. "I warned you, Wulf... boldness alone isn’t enough." he says quietly, shaking his head. “And now, it’s cost you everything.”\n\nThe world darkens around me, the firelight fading as my strength leaves me.

"Marshal Thorne has shown his loyalty to me, and loyalty shall not go unrewarded. As promised..."\n\nAs I give my proclamation, each word draws murmurs from the gathered crowd. Yet my voice remains firm, making public promises once whispered in the shadows.\n\nThorne inclines his head, his expression unreadable as he turns to leave the hall. These alliances won me the throne, but will they come to haunt me? In victory, I have made my enemies kneel - but perhaps I have also empowered others who may one day seek to rise."

Their voices rise in ancient oaths, invoking the honour of their forebears and the watchful gaze of the gods who dwell in the wind and mountain. Each vow carries the weight of lives pledged to my cause, binding warriors and fates alike to my banner.\n\nWhen the last words fade into the air, a silence falls, heavy and sacred. From among their kin, warriors step forward - strong, resolute, and sworn to fight for me. Whether few or many, the promises made here will shape the battles to come.\n\nThe runestones bear their promise. The gods bear witness. Now, there is no turning back."
