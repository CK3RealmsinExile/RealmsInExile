 war_of_the_rohirrim.0311.desc:0 "Adorn sits at the head of a long hall, his sheer size matching the tales I have heard. His presence commands the room, though his mannerisms are unlike anything I expected.\n\nAs I lay out my proposal, his people exchange glances, their distrust palpable. Adorn listens, tapping the armrest rhythmically, tilting his head as if amused by the very idea. Suddenly, he lets out a booming laugh, his grin widening into something unnerving. “A marriage and an alliance, you say? And what, pray, makes you think you deserve such gifts?”\n\nBefore I can answer, he stands abruptly, pacing with a heavy tread. “The mountains demand more than words,” he says, gesturing grandly toward the peaks visible through the open doorway. “They demand endurance, strength, and favour with the gods who rule these heights.”\n\nHe stops and points a massive finger at me, his grin sharp. “Prove yourself, boy. Survive the snowy peaks alone. No provisions, no weapons, no comforts. Strip yourself bare and face the mountain as the gods intended. Return alive, and I will grant you my daughter’s hand and my support. Fail, and…” He chuckles darkly, “well, my men will see you safely home. Or whatever is left of you.”\n\nA murmur of discontent ripples through my men, their unease plain."

The snow beneath my feet shifts treacherously, but I press on.\n\nI dig shallow hollows in the snow at night, curling into them as best I can to keep the wind at bay. My bare skin burns with every gust, but I find warmth in motion, refusing to let the cold claim me. I chew on strips of bark and frozen moss, their bitterness sharp on my tongue, to keep hunger at bay.\n\nMy thoughts wander as exhaustion sets in. I picture the Mountainfather’s mocking grin and the suspicious stares of his men. These visions fuel my resolve. This ordeal is not for glory or pride - it is for survival, for power, for the throne that must be mine.\n\nOn the third day, the peaks seem less cruel. The horizon stretches before me, and though my limbs are leaden, I take another step, and then another. The mountain has battered me, but I have endured."

I move steadily at first, my steps deliberate as I search for any semblance of shelter. My hands are raw from clawing through the snow, scraping together meagre hollows to block the wind when night falls.\n\nThe days bleed together as the cold gnaws at my resolve. I press onward, determined to prove myself, yet the mountain gives no quarter. My limbs grow heavier, my vision blurs, and the once-bright fire in my heart fades to embers.\n\nOn the second night, I awaken to find my fingers numb, my body shaking violently. The snow presses down around me, and the distant peaks seem like mocking sentinels. My thoughts falter, and fear takes hold. If I remain, I will die.\n\nI force myself to my feet, staggering back in the direction of the hall. Each step is an agony, each breath a rasp. The weight of failure presses down on me, sharper than the cold. I have no choice but to return, defeated but alive."

I can barely feel my legs, and my hands are numb, lifeless extensions of my will. The world blurs before me, the peaks fading into an endless expanse of white.\n\nI sink to my knees, the snow cradling me like an unfeeling embrace. My breath comes in shallow gasps, the chill wrapping itself around my chest. For a moment, I think of rising, but my strength is gone. All that remains are my thoughts.\n\nHow did I get here? What was all this for? Vengeance? Or was it pride, the same blind hubris that led my father to his death? I think of Helm Hammerhand, the man who took everything from me, and wonder if he would laugh to see me now - broken and alone on the side of a mountain, all for the hand of a child and the chance of power.\n\nThe snow falls gently, the wind howls softly, and I let my eyes close as a white blanket falls over me."

I must admit, boy, I’m impressed.” He claps his hands together, the sound echoing like the crack of thunder. “You’ve endured where many would have perished. Strength like that deserves respect.”\n\nHe rises, spreading his arms theatrically as the hall erupts in cheers. “The girl, the alliance, it’s yours. And I’ll even send you home with an honour guard.

The eyes of [mountainfather.GetFirstNamePossessive] warriors follow my every move, their faces unreadable - some filled with scorn, others with pity. My own men glance at me, their worry poorly masked, the weight of their disappointment pressing down on me.\n\nAdorn’s laughter booms through the hall, shattering the silence. He leans forward in his great chair, his grin wide and wicked. “So, the mighty suitor returns,” he says, his tone dripping with mockery. “Did the spirits of the mountain prove too harsh for you, boy? Or was it simply the snow that bested you?”\n\nI clench my fists as his warriors laugh and jeer and I struggle with my thoughts.

The hall falls silent, then erupts in disbelief as Adorn slaps the ground in surrender.\n\nHe rises slowly, laughing and spreading his arms wide. “Well fought, boy! Perhaps the spirit of Gobha blesses you after all. You can have it. The girl, the alliance, all of it!” His slap on my back nearly topples me. “And you’ll return to Dunland with an honour guard.

Héra.\n\nI remember those days of youth, running together beneath skies like this. The fields were endless then, a world without borders or burdens. Her laughter would rise with the wind, bright and unyielding, a sound that lingers still. She was my dearest companion, her spirit fierce and free.\n\nBut the years have been cruel. She stands now on the side of my enemy, her father, the man who shattered my world. I wonder if she thinks of me at all, or if my name is one she can no longer bear to speak.\n\nStill, my choice is clear.
