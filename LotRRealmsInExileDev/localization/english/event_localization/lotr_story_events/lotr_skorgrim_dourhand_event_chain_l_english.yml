 skorgrim_dourhand.0100.t: "The Words of the Watcher"
 skorgrim_dourhand.0100.desc: "Within the bounds of [GetTitleByKey('c_zillinakhur').GetNameNoTier], news reaches me of a crumbling scroll discovered among the ruins of an ancient library. Its surface is cracked and dim with age, yet the runes are still legible. Written upon it is the account of [khathza_the_watcher.GetFirstNameNicknamed]. It describes the wrath of [king|E] [naugladur.GetFirstName] of the [firebeards|E] following the betrayal of [elu_thingol|E] of [GetTitleByKey('k_doriath').GetNameNoTier] after the reshaping of the [nauglamir|E] by [dwarven|E] craftsmen to hold a [silmaril|E]. Khathzâ recounts his role as an envoy to [elu_thingol.GetFirstName] and one of only two Dwarves to survive the treachery.\n\nAfter returning to [nogrod|E], Khathzâ went on to teach all who would listen the ways of the [GetFaithByKey('faith_firebeards').GetAdherentNamePlural], declaring that those who rely on the judgment of others are destined to fail.\n\nHis words strike deep. The treachery he endured feels little different from the ridicule I suffer, dismissed, restrained, and left to falter while my liege looks on. Perhaps I was meant to hear this tale, to remember, as Khathzâ taught, that the memory of past betrayals is the only safeguard against future ones."
