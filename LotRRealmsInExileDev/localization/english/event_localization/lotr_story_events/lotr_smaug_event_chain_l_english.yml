 smaug_event_chain.0100.title:0 "Fire and Death"
 smaug_event_chain.0100.dwarf.desc:0 "In the night I awake suddenly, stirred by the sounds of chaos, in the dale ring bells wildly. Fellow Dwarves rush around me, faces pale, and I am grabbed before I even know what is happening. Amidst the clamour I make out a single word:\n\n#emp Dragon#!.\n\nThere is screaming, distant and faint, but it is drowned out as my ears are consumed by the hideous screech of flame. I rush to the great windows, possessed by shock, and I see only billowing black smoke and snarling red fire.\n\nIt is all consuming. All of it. The shadow of great wings fall upon me. I stumble. There is a flash of scales, red and golden, yet before I get a full view of the [dragon|E] I am pulled aside by my guards."
 smaug_event_chain.0100.elf.desc:0 "Elf desc"
 smaug_event_chain.0100.orc.desc:0 "I am up patrolling the parapets with my iron-clad bodyguard, idly inspecting some good Orcish stonework, when heat envelops me - the hot air cracks my lips and in the distance, I hear great gales of wind roaring ever closer. We Orcs have dark-eyes but I don't need them - the smell hits me first. The stink of charred wood and flesh assails my nose, creeping into my nostrils and watery eyes, and I shy away from the wall. My soldiers haven't had a good raid for a little while. So who is...?\n\nThen I see it, against the ever-growing dimness of the smog in the vale, high in the night before the moon. A great shadow, with smoke and fire trailing behind it, carried in the sky by a raging wind. And though I have never seen this thing before, somehow I know its nature, from age-old memories of torture and death felt in my body. I can feel my eyes growing wide with fear and awe even as the clouds of ash force them closed. Then my mouth speaks without my command, and I shout:\n\n#emp Dragon#! My bodyguards, loyal as can be for Orcs, jump to, and we break for the back-entrance, long-loping legs in our favor. Bells and cries, and shouts of rage and fear, begin to ring."
 smaug_event_chain.0100.desc:0 "First I hear the wind, moaning in the black and balmy night, like a hurricane descending from the north. It stirs me from my rest, and I wander to my balcony to see what is happening. With each step my eyes droop, and sleep calls to me. The air feels dry upon my skin.\n\nThen ring the bells. They are loud, piercing the night, and they jolt me awake as if a rushing torrent of icy water was thrown upon me. My eyes fall immediately upon the guards of the wall, and I see they look into the sky with pale faces. The howling wind grows louder, and I look up too.\n\nAgainst the of the moon expands the shadow of a pair of great black wings, and before I can even gasp, my ears are filled with the hideous screech of flame. Immediately I am grabbed by my shouting guards, and the bells grow louder."

 smaug_event_chain.0101.title:0 "The Escape"
 smaug_event_chain.0101.dwarf.desc:0 "I feel the heat of the flame, and I see the shadow upon the floors, but I stand. The men, women, and children of [GetTitleByKey('k_erebor').GetNameNoTier] rush past me, but I heft my axe and stand. Fear and adrenaline course through my heart, and my retinue and I slowly step back.\n\nThe [dragon|E] roars, and fire fills the corridor fr ahead of me. Behind me is a secret exit, a back door, ever so close yet so far. Someone must hold off the dragon, if we are to escape.\n\nYet before I may even give an order, there is a roar in the hall. Not one of a dragon nor savage beast, but one of a company of Dwarves. Around me rush countless of them, armor shimmering in the light of fire and axes swinging with the fury of the sons of Durin, and they rush forth, eyes alight with rage.\n\nThey will not return. I gulp and turn, and as I close the door behind me, I hear their rageful screams. The wind moans in the night."
 smaug_event_chain.0101.elf.desc:0 "Elf desc"
 smaug_event_chain.0101.orc.desc:0 "The roar of flame is cut only by the lash of the whips, as my taskmasters get to work herding the few orcs who aren't allowed to pick up weapons out of our hold, pressing in their hands as much loot and supplies as they can carry. But rioters are everywhere, and me and my folk cut down an few unfortunate snagas who thought they could make the best of the situation. Quickly now, we make our way to the end of the orc-hold, surrounded by archers loosing poison-darts from bows of horn. But all the might of Orcish artillery is for naught - I watch in terror as the bolts bounce off the golden scales of the great beast, shimmering red in the light of the fire. In return, it sends a volley of flame, and stone and flesh chars as I hear my orcs scream. My heart is pounding, and we make for the exit quick-like, while the flame of the dragon roils and rumbles through the hold. I signal to my bodyguard, and they quickly hack off the legs of any of those too unfortunate to be at the back of the train.\n\nWe leave them for the dragon, while we fly like birds, our feathers fanned by a fiery breeze."
 smaug_event_chain.0101.desc:0 "Driven by the ringing of the bells I descend the flights of stairs, surrounded by my guards and family, and my heart races. Sweat drips down my forehead as I hear the screams of men and the roar of fire and destruction. Only when I am out once more can I finally see the situation.\n\nSmoke rises, thick and blacker than the sky, as the dragon swoops in once more. There is a twang of arrows as a volley fires in unison, but I can only watch in horror as they bounce off. Innocent people rush all around me, the sounds of their terror resounding in the night. At the piercing shrill of a horn charge forth warriors clad in armor, but within seconds they are ash before the dragon's ire. Towers collapse in booming explosions of brick and stone, houses are turned to rubble in seconds, and as my guards lead me from the city, I cannot muster a sound.\n\nThe bells ring in the dale."

 smaug_event_chain.0103.dwarf.desc:0 "The fire roars upon the heights, and the wind moans in the night. The [lonelymountain|E] is shrouded in smoke under the pale moon. Only as I stand, far from the desolation, do I finally take in the horror.\n\nThe valley is bathed in scarlet and gold, dreadful and bright and hideous, and black smoke smothers the stars. Upon the high hills are the black shapes of the trees, tall towers set aflame. Dale, the great city, is too consumed, for its rooves and houses burn, and its walls are laid bare, and its people huddle under the shadow of night.\n\nAnd last of all I look upon the [dragon|E], its shape visible as it flies against the moon. I clutch my axe, and for a moment I feel burning rage. Then, sorrow, and tiredness.\n\nThe bells ring still, faintly, so faintly."
 smaug_event_chain.0103.elf.desc:0 "Elf desc"
 smaug_event_chain.0103.orc.desc:0 "The trees and ferns burn, while the orc-hold -#italic my# orc-hold - shrivels like a fizzling torch to light the night. I look upon my domain, and see the true breadth of the destruction.\n\nThe valley is bathed in scarlet and gold, dreadful and bright and hideous, and black smoke smothers the stars. Upon the high hills are the black shapes of the trees, tall towers set aflame. Dale, the great city, is too consumed, for its rooves and houses burn, and its walls are laid bare, and its people huddle under the shadow of night. So too is [erebor|E] consumed by flame and wreathed in smoke, the greatest home of the beardlings fallen. The gate is rent asunder, and dim lights, red and orange, dance within. The dragon has claimed its prize, though I wish it was mine, but more than Erebor I wish for the safety of my hold. I clench my hands and stamp my feet as I look upon the [dragon|E], that beast high above the clouds. Oh, how I wish I could throttle him! I clutch at my sword's hilt, rageful and frothing. But thoughs of vengeance gives way to tiredness. \n\nThe bells keep ringing, ever so faintly, just out of reach."
 smaug_event_chain.0103.desc:0 "The pines roars upon the height, and the wind moans in the night. Dale burns. Only as I stand, far from the desolation, do I finally take in the horror.\n\nThe valley is bathed in scarlet and gold, dreadful and bright and hideous, and black smoke smothers the stars. The inhabitants of Dale, my very own people, huddle under the shadow of night, leaving the city in streams. Upon the high hills are the black shapes of the trees, like burnt matches. Mighty [erebor|E] is too consumed, the [lonelymountain|E] shrouded in smoke, its great gate rent asunder, its riches now certainly piled into a great bed for the dragon.\n\nFoul, wretched [dragon|E]. It sits atop the mountain's peak, black against the moon. At its very sight I grasp my sword's hilt, and for a moment I feel burning rage. Then, sorrow, and tiredness.\n\nThe bells ring still, faintly, so faintly."

 smaug_event_chain.0105.title:0 "The Many Roads"
 smaug_event_chain.0105.desc:0 "As I watch most of the survivors of Smaug's attack move east to seek refuge in the Iron Hills, a difficult decision lies before me. Should I join the other survivors and with head bowed and plead for help and aid from my Dwarf brethren, or should I lead my followers through the dangers of the wilderness to seek a brighter future? I must consider my options.\n\nFar in the west the realms of the [dwarves|E] of the [bluemountains|E] live in prosperity, and though their mansions are a far cry from the great realms of [nogrod|E] and [belegost|E], their realms are mighty still and far from most danger. It would make a perfect place for my kin to live and prosper, but the road there will be long and beset by perils.\n\nYet my heart calls me to a different place altogether. Long have I dreamt and thought of the splendour of [khazaddum|E]: its golden roofs and silver floors and mighty pillars carved from living rock, shimmering in the undimmed light of lamps hewn from crystal. It is fallen, yes, and many would say to go there would be utterly foolish.\n\nPerhaps they are right, but it is as if [mahalcharacter|E] himself beckons me."

Yet my age is upon me, and I am weary.\n\nNow, in the twilight of my years, I feel I must make one final journey. Fallen [khazaddum|E] was once the greatest and most wonderful home of my people. Its halls are dark now, but they call to me still, and I cannot resist it.\n\nI shall set off soon, though I do not know what fate lies for me. [Thror_primary_heir.GetFirstName] shall take all I have."

 smaug_event_chain.0111.desc:0 "The entrance into [khazaddum|E], greatest of the dwarven-halls, and my birthright, lies before me. I tell my companion to wait here as I venture forth. His pleas of retreat and return fall on my ears, but I heed them not - I shall reclaim what is ours!\n\nBut my steps, proud at first, as an heir that has returned to his kingship, begin to falter. For as I walk across the bridge of Khazad-dûm, a creeping feeling overtakes me - beyond the dark of the halls, shadows flit in the darkness - at least, so it seems in the dim light. Still, I cannot give up now - Khazad-dûm is mine, and my peoples. I must be brave for them!\n\nStill, my unease grew steeper as I moved farther into the core of the mountains. Light is of no-use here, the torch I bore lighting scare a foot in front of me. The shadows have grown deeper and fell sounds reach me from hidden catacombs and collapsed halls. Then my feet stop in their tracks - for from the darkness something stares at me, two red glowering eyes.\n\nRun, run, I thought, but my feet stood frozen-still, until an arrow reached them. Then I ran as fast as dwarf-legs can, but all around me I heard the soft pad-pad of enemy footsteps. The exit was blocked and I could only move deeper and deeper."

 smaug_event_chain.0112.title:0 "Thrór son of Dáin"
 smaug_event_chain.0112.desc:0 "Shadows have fallen upon [khazaddum|E], though I was the only one there to witness them. But as I ran, I realized that my pursuers had changed direction more than once - they were not simply chasing me, they were leading me somewhere! But my insight came too late, for now I could not stop - but a sense of Doom was upon me, and my breath was flagging.\n\nAs I charged through a last set of doors I froze still, torch in one hand and looted axe in the other. Around me, teeming on the floor and the alcoves of the hall, was a huge throng of Orcs girt in black iron and carrying curved steel swords. And I knew that this was my end. But I am Thrór son of Dáin, heir to the line of Durin! I am a son of Mahal!\n\n"Baruk Khazâd!" My axe bit into the flesh of a few encircling orcs, but too little and too late - I was knocked to the ground, a great mace crushing my ribs and knocking the wind out of me. Wheezing, I look upon the leader, a great orc of brute strength. "If your family wishes to know who slew you, beggar-beard, they shall know it was me, [Azog.GetFirstName]!"\n\nI screamed and kicked around, breathless, but it was to no help. [Azog.GetFirstName] hold a blade in his hand and was getting ready to strike for my head. My last thoughts are of my wife, and my son, Thráin."

 smaug_event_chain.0113.desc:0 "For days my scouts have been following a company of two [dwarves|E] - [Thror.GetFirstName] and Nár are their names, and they have found the entrance to [khazaddum|E] - to my mountain. [Thror.GetFirstName] left his companion outside and entered the mountain alone.\n\nCome to steal from me, little beardling? Very funny! Let me and my orcs show him what we think of Dwarvish jokes.\n\nI let my scouts suround him, cut off his way out and lead him to me, while I ready my great sword - I cannot wait to kill a stinking dwarf! And here he comes - I hear his steps getting closer and closer to me. A dwarf, maybe once a king by the finery of the few jewels on his person, but now lessened, and soon to be dead. One of my lieutenants slams his chest with a mace, and he falls to the floor breathless. My soldiers look to me to claim the final prize, and I raise my sword."
 smaug_event_chain.0113.a:0 "If your kin wishes to know who slew you, beggar-beard, let them know it was me, Azog!"
 smaug_event_chain.0113.a.tt:0 "The swing comes down, and what feeble resistance the dwarf had shown is extinguished.\n\nBut I am not one for wanton cruelty - this beardling is just a message, and I have the perfect messenger outside, hiding in the rocks nearby. Let us prepare a weregild for his companion's death.\n\nAs I carve [Azog.GetFirstName] in Dwarf-runes into [Thror.GetFirstName]´s severed head, we make for the entrance. After this, no dwarves will defy me, and all orcs shall serve me. I am the master!"

Nár related the sad story to me and my fellows:\n\n"... after many days, I heard a great shout and the sound of a great horn echoed from the mountain. Then [Thror.GetFirstName]´s body was thrown out, and a foul voice issued from [khazaddum|E]. Into [Thror.GetFirstName]´s severed head was carved the name of the master of Moria, foulest of the orcs! [Azog.GetFirstName] was put there, in dwarf-runes. But they did not kill me, instead they send me back with this message, and this... consolation."\n\nNar clutched the bag of coins, only a few and of little worth, and tears flowed freely down his wild, matted beard. With some time, he continued, and relayed the message of vile Azog. "No dwarf shall enter [moria|E]. And they did not let me take [Thror.GetFirstName] back -  they hacked his body to pieced and fed it to black crows."\n\nI have sat for seven days in silence since hearing this news, after tearing my beard and weeping my tears, and I have not eaten out of grief.

Rule must pass to my son and heir, Thráin... he must avenge me! Avenge my mutilation!\n\nThráin, o Thráin, if only you could see me now... nay, loyal Nár, turn your eyes aside!
