 smaug_event_chain.0100.title:0 "Fire and Death"
 smaug_event_chain.0100.dwarf.desc:0 "In the night I awake suddenly, stirred by the sounds of chaos, in the dale ring bells wildly. Fellow Dwarves rush around me, faces pale, and I am grabbed before I even know what is happening. Amidst the clamour I make out a single word:\n\n#emp Dragon#!.\n\nThere is screaming, distant and faint, but it is drowned out as my ears are consumed by the hideous screech of flame. I rush to the great windows, possessed by shock, and I see only billowing black smoke and snarling red fire.\n\nIt is all consuming. All of it. The shadow of great wings fall upon me. I stumble. There is a flash of scales, red and golden, yet before I get a full view of the [dragon|E] I am pulled aside by my guards."
 smaug_event_chain.0100.elf.desc:0 "Elf desc"
 smaug_event_chain.0100.orc.desc:0 "I am up patrolling the parapets with my iron-clad bodyguard, idly inspecting some good Orcish stonework, when heat envelops me - the hot air cracks my lips and in the distance, I hear great gales of wind roaring ever closer. We Orcs have dark-eyes but I don't need them - the smell hits me first. The stink of charred wood and flesh assails my nose, creeping into my nostrils and watery eyes, and I shy away from the wall. My soldiers haven't had a good raid for a little while. So who is...?\n\nThen I see it, against the ever-growing dimness of the smog in the vale, high in the night before the moon. A great shadow, with smoke and fire trailing behind it, carried in the sky by a raging wind. And though I have never seen this thing before, somehow I know its nature, from age-old memories of torture and death felt in my body. I can feel my eyes growing wide with fear and awe even as the clouds of ash force them closed. Then my mouth speaks without my command, and I shout:\n\n#emp Dragon#! My bodyguards, loyal as can be for Orcs, jump to, and we break for the back-entrance, long-loping legs in our favor. Bells and cries, and shouts of rage and fear, begin to ring."
 smaug_event_chain.0100.desc:0 "First I hear the wind, moaning in the black and balmy night, like a hurricane descending from the north. It stirs me from my rest, and I wander to my balcony to see what is happening. With each step my eyes droop, and sleep calls to me. The air feels dry upon my skin.\n\nThen ring the bells. They are loud, piercing the night, and they jolt me awake as if a rushing torrent of icy water was thrown upon me. My eyes fall immediately upon the guards of the wall, and I see they look into the sky with pale faces. The howling wind grows louder, and I look up too.\n\nAgainst the of the moon expands the shadow of a pair of great black wings, and before I can even gasp, my ears are filled with the hideous screech of flame. Immediately I am grabbed by my shouting guards, and the bells grow louder."

 smaug_event_chain.0101.dwarf.desc:0 "I feel the heat of the flame, and I see the shadow upon the floors, but I stand. The men, women, and children of [GetTitleByKey('k_erebor').GetNameNoTier] rush past me, but I heft my axe and stand. Fear and adrenaline course through my heart, and my retinue and I slowly step back.\n\nThe [dragon|E] roars, and fire fills the corridor for ahead of me. Behind me is a secret exit, a back door, ever so close yet so far. Someone must hold off the dragon, if we are to escape.\n\nYet before I may even give an order, there is a roar in the hall. Not one of a dragon nor savage beast, but one of a company of Dwarves. Around me rush countless of them, armor shimmering in the light of fire and axes swinging with the fury of the sons of Durin, and they rush forth, eyes alight with rage.\n\nThey will not return. I gulp and turn, and as I close the door behind me, I hear their rageful screams. The wind moans in the night."
 smaug_event_chain.0101.elf.desc:0 "Elf desc"
 smaug_event_chain.0101.orc.desc:0 "The roar of flame is cut only by the lash of the whips, as my taskmasters get to work herding the few orcs who aren't allowed to pick up weapons out of our hold, pressing in their hands as much loot and supplies as they can carry. But rioters are everywhere, and me and my folk cut down an few unfortunate snagas who thought they could make the best of the situation. Quickly now, we make our way to the end of the orc-hold, surrounded by archers loosing poison-darts from bows of horn. But all the might of Orcish artillery is for naught - I watch in terror as the bolts bounce off the golden scales of the great beast, shimmering red in the light of the fire. In return, it sends a volley of flame, and stone and flesh chars as I hear my orcs scream. My heart is pounding, and we make for the exit quick-like, while the flame of the dragon roils and rumbles through the hold. I signal to my bodyguard, and they quickly hack off the legs of any of those too unfortunate to be at the back of the train.\n\nWe leave them for the dragon, while we fly like birds, our feathers fanned by a fiery breeze."
 smaug_event_chain.0101.desc:0 "Driven by the ringing of the bells I descend the flights of stairs, surrounded by my guards and family, and my heart races. Sweat drips down my forehead as I hear the screams of men and the roar of fire and destruction. Only when I am out once more can I finally see the situation.\n\nSmoke rises, thick and blacker than the sky, as the dragon swoops in once more. There is a twang of arrows as a volley fires in unison, but I can only watch in horror as they bounce off. Innocent people rush all around me, the sounds of their terror resounding in the night. At the piercing shrill of a horn charge forth warriors clad in armor, but within seconds they are ash before the dragon's ire. Towers collapse in booming explosions of brick and stone, houses are turned to rubble in seconds, and as my guards lead me from the city, I cannot muster a sound.\n\nThe bells ring in the dale."

 smaug_event_chain.0103.dwarf.desc:0 "The fire roars upon the heights, and the wind moans in the night. The [lonelymountain|E] is shrouded in smoke under the pale moon. Only as I stand, far from the desolation, do I finally take in the horror.\n\nThe valley is bathed in scarlet and gold, dreadful and bright and hideous, and black smoke smothers the stars. Upon the high hills are the black shapes of the trees, tall towers set aflame. Dale, the great city, is too consumed, for its rooves and houses burn, and its walls are laid bare, and its people huddle under the shadow of night.\n\nAnd last of all I look upon the [dragon|E], its shape visible as it flies against the moon. I clutch my axe, and for a moment I feel burning rage. Then, sorrow, and tiredness.\n\nThe bells ring still, faintly, so faintly."

 smaug_event_chain.0103.orc.desc:0 "The trees and ferns burn, while the orc-hold -#italic my# orc-hold - shrivels like a fizzling torch to light the night. I look upon my domain, and see the true breadth of the destruction.\n\nThe valley is bathed in scarlet and gold, dreadful and bright and hideous, and black smoke smothers the stars. Upon the high hills are the black shapes of the trees, tall towers set aflame. Dale, the great city, is too consumed, for its rooves and houses burn, and its walls are laid bare, and its people huddle under the shadow of night. So too is [erebor|E] consumed by flame and wreathed in smoke, the greatest home of the beardlings fallen. The gate is rent asunder, and dim lights, red and orange, dance within. The dragon has claimed its prize, though I wish it was mine, but more than Erebor I wish for the safety of my hold. I clench my hands and stamp my feet as I look upon the [dragon|E], that beast high above the clouds. Oh, how I wish I could throttle him! I clutch at my sword's hilt, rageful and frothing. But thoughs of vengeance gives way to tiredness. \n\nThe bells keep ringing, ever so faintly, just out of reach."
 smaug_event_chain.0103.desc:0 "The pines roars upon the height, and the wind moans in the night. Dale burns. Only as I stand, far from the desolation, do I finally take in the horror.\n\nThe valley is bathed in scarlet and gold, dreadful and bright and hideous, and black smoke smothers the stars. The inhabitants of Dale, my very own people, huddle under the shadow of night, leaving the city in streams. Upon the high hills are the black shapes of the trees, like burnt matches. Mighty [erebor|E] is too consumed, the [lonelymountain|E] shrouded in smoke, its great gate rent asunder, its riches now certainly piled into a great bed for the dragon.\n\nFoul, wretched [dragon|E]. It sits atop the mountain's peak, black against the moon. At its very sight I grasp my sword's hilt, and for a moment I feel burning rage. Then, sorrow, and tiredness.\n\nThe bells ring still, faintly, so faintly."

 smaug_event_chain.0105.desc:0 "As I watch most of the survivors of Smaug's attack move east to seek refuge in the Iron Hills, a difficult decision lies before me. Should I join the other survivors and with head bowed and plead for help and aid from my [dwarf|E] brethren, or should I lead my followers through the dangers of the wilderness to seek a brighter future? I must consider my options.\n\nFar in the west the realms of the [dwarves|E] of the [bluemountains|E] live in prosperity, and though their mansions are a far cry from the great realms of [nogrod|E] and [belegost|E], their realms are mighty still and far from most danger. It would make a perfect place for my kin to live and prosper, but the road there will be long and beset by perils.\n\nYet my heart calls me to a different place altogether. Long have I dreamt and thought of the splendour of [khazaddum|E]: its golden roofs and silver floors and mighty pillars carved from living rock, shimmering in the undimmed light of lamps hewn from crystal. It is fallen, yes, and many would say to go there would be utterly foolish.\n\nPerhaps they are right, but it is as if [mahalcharacter|E] himself beckons me."

 smaug_event_chain.0111.desc:0 "The entrance into [khazaddum|E], greatest of the dwarven-halls, and my birthright, lies before me. I tell my companion to wait here as I venture forth. His pleas of retreat and return fall on my ears, but I heed them not - I shall reclaim what is ours!\n\nBut my steps, proud at first, as an heir that has returned to his kingship, begin to falter. For as I walk across the bridge of Khazad-dûm, a creeping feeling overtakes me - beyond the dark of the halls, shadows flit in the darkness - at least, so it seems in the dim light. Still, I cannot give up now - Khazad-dûm is mine, and my peoples. I must be brave for them!\n\nStill, my unease grew steeper as I moved farther into the core of the mountains. Light is of no-use here, the torch I bore lighting scare a foot in front of me. The shadows have grown deeper and fell sounds reach me from hidden catacombs and collapsed halls. Then my feet stop in their tracks - for from the darkness something stares at me, two red glowering eyes.\n\nRun, run, I thought, but my feet stood frozen-still, until an arrow reached them. Then I ran as fast as dwarf-legs can, but all around me I heard the soft pad-pad of enemy footsteps. The exit was blocked and I could only move deeper and deeper."
 smaug_event_chain.0111.no_orc.desc:0 "I stand before the great gate of [khazaddum|E], once the greatest of the realms of the [dwarves|E] to ever grace [middleearth|E], and stare past them into sable emptiness. There is silence. I gulp, and step forth to claim my heritage, torch in hand.\n\nYet each hesitant footstep of mine echoes within the halls, and the torch illuminates but a few feet about me. Fear takes my heart. I can feel the vastness of the halls around me, and their hollowness too. It is too silent.\n\nToo silent! I stop. I must stop. The crackling of my torch and my breaths are all consuming, they are all I hear. The shadows dance. I look forth, and there is darkness, darkness unending. Not the absence of light, but shrouding shadow. There is something there, near or far I know not, but my heart pounds within my chest. I cannot go farther.

 smaug_event_chain.0112.desc:0 "Shadows have fallen upon [khazaddum|E], though I was the only one there to witness them. But as I ran, I realized that my pursuers had changed direction more than once - they were not simply chasing me, they were leading me somewhere! But my insight came too late, for now I could not stop - but a sense of Doom was upon me, and my breath was flagging.\n\nAs I charged through a last set of doors I froze still, torch in one hand and looted axe in the other. Around me, teeming on the floor and the alcoves of the hall, was a huge throng of Orcs girt in black iron and carrying curved steel swords. And I knew that this was my end. But I am Thrór son of Dáin, heir to the line of Durin! I am a son of Mahal!\n\n"Baruk Khazâd!" My axe bit into the flesh of a few encircling orcs, but too little and too late - I was knocked to the ground, a great mace crushing my ribs and knocking the wind out of me. Wheezing, I look upon the leader, a great orc of brute strength. "If your family wishes to know who slew you, beggar-beard, they shall know it was me, [Azog.GetFirstName]!"\n\nI screamed and kicked around, breathless, but it was to no help. [Azog.GetFirstName] hold a blade in his hand and was getting ready to strike for my head. My last thoughts are of my wife, and my son, Thráin."

[Thror.GetFirstName] left his companion outside and entered the mountain alone.\n\nCome to steal from me, little beardling? Very funny! Let me and my orcs show him what we think of Dwarvish jokes.\n\nI let my scouts suround him, cut off his way out and lead him to me, while I ready my great sword - I cannot wait to kill a stinking dwarf! And here he comes - I hear his steps getting closer and closer to me. A dwarf, maybe once a king by the finery of the few jewels on his person, but now lessened, and soon to be dead. One of my lieutenants slams his chest with a mace, and he falls to the floor breathless. My soldiers look to me to claim the final prize, and I raise my sword."

Let us prepare a weregild for his companion's death.\n\nAs I carve [Azog.GetFirstName] in Dwarf-runes into [Thror.GetFirstName]´s severed head, we make for the entrance. After this, no dwarves will defy me, and all orcs shall serve me. I am the master!"

Nár related the sad story to me and my fellows:\n\n"... after many days, I heard a great shout and the sound of a great horn echoed from the mountain. Then [Thror.GetFirstName]´s body was thrown out, and a foul voice issued from [khazaddum|E]. Into [Thror.GetFirstName]´s severed head was carved the name of the master of Moria, foulest of the orcs! [Azog.GetFirstName] was put there, in dwarf-runes. But they did not kill me, instead they send me back with this message, and this... consolation."\n\nNar clutched the bag of coins, only a few and of little worth, and tears flowed freely down his wild, matted beard. With some time, he continued, and relayed the message of vile [Azog.GetFirstName]. "No dwarf shall enter [moria|E]. And they did not let me take [Thror.GetFirstName] back -  they hacked his body to pieced and fed it to black crows."\n\nI have sat for seven days in silence since hearing this news, after tearing my beard and weeping my tears, and I have not eaten out of grief.

Save for a few days spent with the Lake-Men of Esgaroth, our time was spent in vain attempt to find a proper entrance into the Mountain; with the majority blocked by collapsed rubble.\n\nShadowed by the mountain's arms in the south are the grey ruins of ancient homes and towers and walls; the remains of [dale|E]. From a great cliff wall springs the River Running, and along with it steam and dark smoke. An ill omen, whose presence all but confirms the presence of the dragon deep in the Mountain.\n\nYet we have come so far, and we cannot back down. We must proceed to the gate, and into Erebor itself."

Shattered and maimed statues, walls blackened with ash, gates and doors rent and torn. We are to careful to step slowly so we do not stumble upon the aged remains of dead Dwarves, now little more than ashes encased in melted armor."

I cannot see even my companions to the immediate sides of me. The tunnel is utterly straight, and I walk accompanied only by my thoughts. Fear tingles in the back of my mind.\n\nSoon enough a red glow appears far ahead, at first resembling a star, but slowly growing larger. My heart races inside my chest, and I grasp the hilt of my axe. The tunnel grows hotter, and wisps of vapor float in the air. Then a sound enters my ears, the bubbling of a pot mixed with the deep purring of a cat. It is no cat. The tunnel ends, and crouching we enter into the ancient dungeon-hall, and into the red glow.\n\nAcross unseen floors lay countless piles of precious things: gold wrought and unwrought, gems and jewels and silver all stained red in the glow. And upon this endless sea sits sleeping Smaug, red and gold and vast, smoke emerging from his nostrils with every deep breath. We have little time ere he wakes."

I smell you and feel your air. I hear your breath. Come along! There is plenty and to spare!" He says, and his words are deep and terrible. "All of you, in fact! I know the smell and taste of Dwarf- no one better than me, in fact."\n\nHis great tail is a whip, and it launches at me. I dive, and it misses my head by mere feet. There are avalanches of gold, and at once my men unleash a barrage of axes and arrows and spears. They all bounce off. The dragon lets out an ear-splitting roar, and his throat bulges red."

The ground shudders.\n\nA shadow falls upon me as the dragon stretches its wings, mighty and red, and speaks in a booming voice: "My armour is like tenfold shields, my teeth are swords, my claws spears, the shock of my tail a thunderbolt, my wings a hurricane, and my breath death. I am old, and strong, strong, strong!"\n\nYet as he gloats, I spot a tunnel, far away. It might be our only chance of escape, and so I rise to my feet and proclaim as loudly as I can:"

The dragon follows, its snout entering the tunnel from which leaps a thong of flame, but it cannot reach us. Neither can the dragon proceed further, for the tunnel is too narrow. We stop and catch our breaths as the dragon retreats. I grip my axe tightly.\n\nThe tunnel rumbles. A mighty roar fills the air. We sprint.\n\nOverhead Smaug unleashes his wroth, and the tunnels shake violently as we sprint as fast as we can. Cracks appear around us. They grow bigger and more numerous, like spider's webs in the concrete, before pieces start to collapse behind us. My feet burn.\n\n"Come on!" I exclaim, and Smaug roars as if in return. There is a boom, and ahead of us a piece of rubble falls down, blocking us. The dragon laughs deeply. I get under it, supported by a fellow Dwarf, and with all the strength I can muster, I push."

In a flash of red and gold, Smaug lands before us, wings outstretched. Embers and smoke arise from his nostrils. His claws dig into the ground, and his belly sparkles with a coat of diamond; save for a single spot on his left breast. "What now shall you do?"\n\nHe leaps forward, and I roll to the side, his claws swinging right by me. He turns around and unleashing a mighty boom whips his tail, under which I duck. It passes overhead and with a roar I embed my axe into his tail, only to be launched to the other side of the room. My helm protects my head from the marble wall, and I land near the entrance to a corridor. Where it leads, I do not know, but this is our only hope."

These hallways are not as long, and often merge and turn away and lead to more and more halls. My company is split, some Dwarves running down different hallways and corridors.\n\nSmaug is distracted. Sometimes his eye is trained on me, and I zigzag trying desperately to avoid turning into ashes, until his focus relents. Occasionally I throw an axe to distract him, and sometimes my company to the same, though they always bounce off harmlessly from his diamond-encrusted belly.\n\nI swing into another corridor, away from the dragon's eyes, and I sprint up a winding flight of stairs. I do not know where I go, but I emerge on a high balcony, and I look over the halls. I spot Smaug's current object of focus, a group of Dwarves running almost directly under me, and the dragon follows below. In front of me on a ledge is a bronze head, and if I drop it, it is my chance to save my fellow Dwarves. I must take it."

I rush into a dark corner, a place as apt for hiding as any I could find in a few moments, and wait with bated breath.\n\n"Foul thieving Dwarves!" Smaug snorts with a voice filled with malice. "You hide now, but you shall meet my wrath soon enough. I know that the men of the Lake were your helpers, for I smell them upon you. Up the water you came without a doubt! It is time, then, to pay your friends a visit. They shall see me and remember who is the real King under the Mountain!"\n\nHe arises now in dancing fire, heart burning with rage, and takes off.

But it is the doing of no Dwarf. The trumpets sound to greet the incoming dragon, like a spark of fire quickly approaching. My men ready their bows and aim, and the dragon soars overhead, being met with a hail of arrows. They all bounce off.\n\nFury arises from the dragon's jaws. The trees upon the shore turn blood-red before the dancing shadows. Fire leaps from the thatched roofs, and the quays are consumed in red.

With a chirp the thrush flies off, and I sit silently once more. A cool wind is at my back.\n\nI am startled at a croak when beside me lands an old raven. He introduces himself quickly, quickly gets to the point: the birds gather to the Lonely Mountain and Dale again, for Smaug is dead.\n\nMy party and I arise with shocked gasps, and we rush to the south of the Mountain. There, far-off, I descry Smaug dead upon the smoldering ruins of Lake-Town, and joy takes my heart. The dragon is dead, and the treasure is ours!"

The trees by the shore shine like copper and blood, leaping black shadows at their feet. With each pass, fire leaps from the dragon's jaws.\n\nArrows launch in volleys, but they all bounce off the dragon's underbelly. The thatched roofs explode in flame, and quaysides are consumed in red and gold. Flames unquenchable spring high into the night. The dragon turns again, its tail descending upon the city and leaving a trail of splinters and crumbling ruins in its wake.\n\nBoats leave desperately. They shall be sport for Smaug later.

It seems an eternal moment.\n\nIt lands clean; barb, shaft, and feather disappearing in the dragon's left breast.\n\nThe shriek let out by the dragon fells trees, splits rock, and deafens men. I grasp my ears in pain, watching with wide eyes as it shoots spouting into the air, before it at last turns over and falls. As it does I leap into the water and swim, and I hear the cacophonous crash behind me; the splintering and breaking of wood that lets out hissing embers and gledes. The water swirls, white steam rising up.\n\nI catch my breath as I finally reach the shore, and far off I descry Esgaroth, now ruins upon which lays Smaug the Golden, silent and dead."
