 ring_quest.0400.desc: "#TOLKIENQUOTE A messenger came to Dáin, but not from Moria - from Mordor: a horseman in the night, who called Dain to his gate. The Lord Sauron the Great, so he said, wished for our friendship. Rings he would give for it, such as he gave of old. And has asked urgently concerning hobbits, of what kind they were, and where they dwelt. "For Sauron knows," said he, "that one of these was known to you on a time."\n\nAt this we were greatly troubled, and we gave no answer. And then his fell voice was lowered, and he would have sweetened it if he could. "As a small token only of your friendship Sauron asks this," he said: "that you should find this thief," such was his word, "and get from him, willing or no, a little ring, the least of rings, that once he stole. It is but a trifle that Sauron fancies, and an earnest of your good will. Find it, and three rings that the Dwarf-sires possessed of old shall be returned to you, and the realm of Moria shall be yours for ever. Find only news of the thief, whether he still lives and where, and you shall have great reward and lasting friendship from the Lord. Refuse, and things will no seem so well. Do you refuse?"#!"

 ring_quest.0403.desc: "#TOLKIENQUOTE Twice the messenger has returned, and has gone unanswered. The third and last time, so he says, is soon to come, before the ending on the year.\n\nAnd so I have been sent at last by Dáin to warn Bilbo that he is sought by the Enemy, and to learn, if may be, why he desires this ring, this least of rings. Also we crave the advice of Elrond. For the Shadow grows and draws nearer/#!\n\nMy king has decided up on a course of action at last. We must seek aid and advice, and there is none better to give it than Elrond Halfelven. Bilbo too dwells in his home, and so we may tell him of this danger.

 ring_quest.0600.desc: "#TOLKIENQUOTE Through him the Enemy has learned that the One has been found again. He knows where Isildur fell. He knows where Gollum found his ring. He knows that it is a Great Ring, for it gave long life. He knows that it is not one of the Three, for they have never been lost, and they endure no evil. He knows that it is not one of the Seven, or the Nine, for they are accounted for. He knows that it is the One. And he has at last heard, I think, of hobbits and the Shire.#!\n\nMany years has it been since the wretch Gollum has found himself in my care. Much he has revealled to me, and my greatest loss is now back within my grasp.\n\nStill yet this creature may prove of worth to me, should I send him on some errand of mischief."

 ring_quest.0800.desc: "#TOLKIENQUOTE When Mr. Bilbo Baggins of Bag End announced that he would shortly be celebrating his eleventy-first birthday with a party of special magnificence, there was much talk and excitement in Hobbiton.\n\nEach year the Bagginses had given very lively combined birthday-parties at Bag End; but now it was understood that something quite exceptional was being planned for that autumn. Bilbo was going to be eleventy-one, 111, a rather curious number, and a very respectable age for a hobbit (the Old Took himself had only reached 130); and Frodo was going to be thirty-three, 33, an important number: the date of his ‘coming of age’.\n\nTongues began to wag in Hobbiton and Bywater; and rumour of the coming event travelled all over the Shire. The history and character of Mr. Bilbo Baggins became once again the chief topic of conversation; and the older folk suddenly found their reminiscences in welcome demand.#!\n\n As I grow old, the name has come for me to consider the future. What better way to do so than with a suprise?"
