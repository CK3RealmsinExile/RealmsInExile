 ### Éira Events ###
 bloody_swan.0001.t: "Poison's Sting"
 bloody_swan.0001.desc: "As I stand before the lifeless body of my father, [murdered_father.GetFirstName], my vision blurred by tears that well up in my eyes, I feel like I am on the brink of despair. Long had my father worked to bring the ever-hostile clans of the hills closer together, and in the last months he finally had gotten so close to his goal. But now it seems it was all for naught...\n\nI wipe the tears from my face and look down at my father once more. He looks peaceful in death, at least. But... what's this? Why are the veins on his neck so dark and visible? I call one of the herbalists to my side and they quickly confirm my suspicion: This is the mark of a man that was poisoned. And I think I know who is the villain behind this dark deed..."
 bloody_swan.0001.a: "That hound of [gondor|E] will pay for what he has done, I swear it."
 bloody_swan.0001.a.tt: "Unlocks several #high story decisions#!"

 bloody_swan.0002.t: "Searching for Answers"
 bloody_swan.0002.desc: "My father's dream lingers in the valleys and foothills of this land; a whisper on the wind, a promise left unfinished. He wished for peace between the clans, for unity among our people... and now he lies cold in the earth, betrayed by the very power he once sought to work beside.\n\nI have no proof yet - only a bitter certainty. The poison that took him, the timing of his death, the political tremors it caused; all of it leads my thoughts to [tharbad|E]. To [glormagil.GetName]. I must tread carefully. No rash accusations, no misplaced anger. I need proof. I need witnesses. I need the truth.\n\nWord must be sent to our scattered allies. Old records must be scoured. And perhaps... there are those in Glormagil’s court who hold their own grudges — or loose tongues. I will uncover what was done, and by whose hand. But I will not let my father's death paralyze me. The tribes now look to me. His legacy still brings in their trust. And one way or another, I will see it honored."
 bloody_swan.0002.a: "The time for mourning is over. Now, I must act."
 bloody_swan.0002.a.tt: "You will travel to [tharbad|E] to seek some answers"

 bloody_swan.0003.t: "The Suspect in Tharbad"
 bloody_swan.0003.desc: "All signs point to [tharbad|E]. My father's death was too precise, too convenient, and too clean for a tribal feud or personal grudge. He was a threat only to one man: the one who stands to gain the most from his absence.\n\n[glormagil.GetName], Governor of [enedhwaith|E], pretends to be a distant master, but his reach is longer than most would guess. There are whispers in Tharbad; of servants dismissed too suddenly, healers silenced too quickly, a feast where wine was poured only for one.\n\nIf he truly had my father poisoned, he would not have done so openly. But the truth always leaks through the cracks. I must listen carefully... and strike when the time is right."
 bloody_swan.0003.a: "Your walls cannot protect you from justice, Glormagil."
 bloody_swan.0003.a.tt: "You remain in Tharbad for a few days to seek answers"

 bloody_swan.0004.t: "A Web of Lies"
 bloody_swan.0004.desc: "I've begun to unravel the stories told by those close to [glormagil.GetName]: old servants, exiled scribes, even one of his rivals at court. They all speak carefully, cautiously... but I know how to hear what is left unsaid.\n\nOne man claimed he had seen my father’s name on a list of ‘subversives’ to be watched. Another recalls a strange guest who arrived the night before the poisoning and vanished the day after. A wine merchant remembered being paid to deliver a rare vintage - but only a single bottle.\n\nThese are threads, not yet a rope. But they tighten around Glormagil’s name with each passing day. If I am careful, I will find the proof I need."
 bloody_swan.0004.a: "Keep speaking. I will find the truth, one lie at a time."
 bloody_swan.0004.a.tt: "You are getting closer to finding the proof you need"

 bloody_swan.0005.t: "Proof At Last"
 bloody_swan.0005.desc: "Finally, I have what I need. An aged steward, once in [glormagil.GetName]'s' service, came forward in secret. He could no longer live with the guilt, he said. He saw the poison prepared; a rare mixture only known to certain Gondorian apothecaries. He delivered it himself, hidden in the wine that graced my father's cup.\n\nHe gave me a letter: orders signed in Glormagil’s hand. The signature matches. The seal is true. This is the weapon I have sought.\n\nNow I must decide how best to use it. The tribes will rally behind me if they know the truth. The distangt King of [gondor|E] might listen — or he might bury it. But one thing is certain: Glormagil will come to fear the name of Éira."
 bloody_swan.0005.a: "Now he will see what it means to cross a chieftain's blood."
 bloody_swan.0005.a.tt: "You return to your hall, proof in hand, to decide what to do with it"

 ### Glormagil Events ###
 bloody_swan.0201.t: "The Spark of Rebellion"
 bloody_swan.0201.desc: "Reports from the eastern hills speak of gathering fires, of meetings held in shadow and chieftains forging bonds without my sanction. One name comes up again and again: [eira.GetName], daughter of that damned idealist [murdered_father.GetFirstName] I rid myself of. The girl has her father’s blood, and more besides. She speaks of justice, and of freedom.\n\nFools always forget that justice is decided by those who win. But I will not act hastily. There is no glory in open war with a minor tribal duchy. No; there are other ways to quiet such talk. The whisper of gold in a discontent warrior’s ear. A #italic hunting accident!# for a too-loyal retainer. Perhaps even a secret deal struck with one of her rivals.\n\nThis land has taught me many things. Here, daggers matter more than decrees."
 bloody_swan.0201.a: "Send agents to her court. Sow dissent and break their unity."
 bloody_swan.0201.a.tt: "Unlocks several #high story decisions#!"

 bloody_swan.0202.t: "The Prince’s Messenger"
 bloody_swan.0202.desc: "A dust-covered messenger arrives from the south, bearing the swan crest of Belfalas. His words are blunt, his tone bordering on insolent: [maratar.GetFirstName], second son of the Prince of Belfalas, has led a self-sponsored punitive expedition to deal with the brigands that run rampant on the coasts. Without so much as a whisper to me.\n\nSo. The princeling seeks glory. No doubt he expects to gallop through [enedhwaith|E] like it’s a tournament field, trampling over my delicate network of bribes, truces, and threats.\n\nI could remind him who #italic truly!# governs here. Or perhaps I let him charge into the fire to burn, taking that brigand with him. \n\nBut then again, his father has the King’s ear. Perhaps this Maratar could be… shaped."
 bloody_swan.0202.a: "Send a welcome. We may yet find use for one another."
 bloody_swan.0202.b: "Let him run wild... to his doom."
