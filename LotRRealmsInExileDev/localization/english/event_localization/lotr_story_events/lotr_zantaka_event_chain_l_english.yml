 zantaka_event_chain.0101.t: "The Council Bends"
 zantaka_event_chain.0101.desc: "Though the high and mighty Olygarchs of [GetTitleByKey('k_lyneria').GetNameNoTier] pride themselves on the meritocracy of their republics, the thought that they would elect a concubine of low birth to the rank that she would deserve is laughable. It would be #italic improper#! to have a council-master not born a son of one of the rich and ancient families, after all. In their eyes, one like me should stay silent, accept their orders and suffer anything for their pleasure. \n\nToday, however, that cruel and callous order comes crashing down. The Sylaara, they who had maintained order among the merchants for generations, are utterly destroyed. Overnight, the republic has fallen into anarchy as every Olygarch dreams of taking the role of council-master for themselves. Of course, I am prepared for this. For the past twelve years, I have built a network of spies, hidden from the gaze of any other, and have gathered a list of every murder, broken vow, embezzlement and illegal deal made by the oligarchs that make up the council. \n\nWhen, this morning, the council will gather to elect its new master, the way will be open for me openly denounce these crimes. Unless I receive the votes I deserve, of course..."

 zantaka_event_chain.0102.t: "Citizen Pride"
 zantaka_event_chain.0102.desc: "With my rule now being established, if not popular, one would think that this would be the time for celebration. Indeed, the council knows that any attempt to remove me would bring it down with me, as their crimes would come to ligth and their reputation would plummet. In time, they will learn to bow to my will, as all servants must, but quiet hatred and words of rebellion will do for now. \n\nTo my surprise, however, it is not only the great Olygarchs that seem to detest the thought of the orphan of a tavern girl rising to power over their city. Even common citizens have taken to mocking me and resisting my rule, no matter my obvious skill as ruler. \n\nMy rule over [GetTitleByKey('c_pelorna').GetNameNoTier] seems to grow less secure by the day, every open act of defiance seemingly bringing about another. If I am to survive the coming months, years or perhaps simply weeks, I will need to put these detractors down and remind them that I am not a some arrogant concubine but their rightful master."
 zantaka_event_chain.0102.a: "I will not fail now!"
