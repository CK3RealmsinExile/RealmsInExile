 leofring_event_chain.0001.t:0 "The Call of Dwimordene"
 leofring_event_chain.0001.desc:0 "Some say a sorceress lives in the woods of [dwimordene|E], a fay that can control the mists of the Great River and lure good men to their doom. But we, the Aftercomers - true followers of the faith of the Fey Court - know otherwise. It is a benevolent messenger of [foldewyncharacter|E] - or it might even be the Lady of Plenty herself. \n\nWhether or not the Lady Foldewyn or just one of her handmaidens dwells in the Dwimordene, it is a sacred place nonetheless. \n\nMy [chaplain.GetCouncilTitle] has counseled me to seek out the Lady of Dwimordene, and implore her for guidance in these dark times..."
 leofring_event_chain.0001.a:0 "I shall ask the Lady for guidance."
 leofring_event_chain.0001.a.tt:0 "You will travel to the Dwimordene."
 leofring_event_chain.0001.b:0 "On second thought, I do not wish to go."
 leofring_event_chain.0001.b.tt:0 "You will remain at home, for now. \n\n#I You may decide to visit the Lady at another time#!"
 
 leofring_event_chain.0002.t:0 "A Treetop Abode"
 leofring_event_chain.0002.desc:0 "As I set foot beneath the golden boughs of the [dwimordene|E], I was soon approached by grey-cloaked guards of the Fey-kin. When they asked me to state my business, I replied with honesty, and was permitted to enter their city, built mostly high above the ground, in the golden trees. \n\nThe Lord and Lady of the Fey-kin greet me, and I now find myself struggling to find the right words. "Your search for wisdom has led you here, [ROOT.Char.GetFirstName] of [ROOT.Char.GetPrimaryTitle.GetNameNoTier]," the Lady says, her eyes captivating my humbled gaze. "The Galadhrim may grant council, if you wish to hear it," she adds, giving me time to find the appropriate words for my answer..."
 leofring_event_chain.0002.a:0 "Are... you the Lady [foldewyncharacter|E] herself?"
 leofring_event_chain.0002.b:0 "I would hear your wisdom, high lady."
 leofring_event_chain.0002.c:0 "My thanks. But I have seen enough."
 leofring_event_chain.0002.c.tt:0 "You will return home, for now. \n\n#I The Lady Foldewyn will remember this.#!"
 
 leofring_event_chain.0003.t:0 "The Withered Court"
 leofring_event_chain.0003.desc.a:0 "My host's fair expression betrays faint amusement, but I cannot be sure if this confirms my suspicions or not. \n\nThe Lady replied: "Across the [anduin|E], a dark shadow is spreading. It has already influenced your brethren who dwell in [GetTitleByKey('c_thorlorien').GetNameNoTier]. I bid you to go to them, my friend. You must convince them to turn away from the dark ways of the Withered Court!" \n\nIt is a difficult task she has laid before me, and I am sure this is a decision not to be taken lightly."
 leofring_event_chain.0003.desc:0 "The Lady replies: "Across the [anduin|E], a dark shadow is spreading. It has already influenced your brethren who dwell in [GetTitleByKey('c_thorlorien').GetNameNoTier]. I bid you to go to them, my friend. You must convince them to turn away from the dark ways of the Withered Court!" \n\nIt is a difficult task she has laid before me, and I am sure this is a decision not to be taken lightly."
 leofring_event_chain.0003.a:0 "I shall go to them immediately."
 leofring_event_chain.0003.a.tt:0 "You will travel across the [anduin|E]."
 leofring_event_chain.0003.b:0 "I must reflect on this, Lady [foldewyncharacter|E]."
 leofring_event_chain.0003.b.tt:0 "You will return home, for now. \n\n#I You may travel to [GetTitleByKey('c_thorlorien').GetNameNoTier] at a later time.#!"
 leofring_event_chain.0003.c:0 "I shall submit to your direct guidance."

 leofring_event_chain.0004.t:0 "Across the Great River"
 leofring_event_chain.0004.desc:0 "Crossing the Great River in one of the white boats given to me by Fey, I make my way towards the main dwellings of the Leofrings in [GetTitleByKey('c_thorlorien').GetNameNoTier]. They grant me entrance into the hall of their leader, [thorlorien_leofring.GetName], and [thorlorien_leofring.GetSheHe] bids me to speak my piece. \n\n"My friends, I bring an invitation from the Lady Foldewyn herself," I begin, and make sure to choose my words with extra care. I must make sure to either convince [thorlorien_leofring.GetFirstName] and [thorlorien_leofring.GetHerHis] followers! But is there hope for success? \n\nWould it be wiser to simply say a few honeyed words without consequence, if I cannot turm them from their dark path?"
 leofring_event_chain.0004.a:0 "I will attempt to persuade them."
 leofring_event_chain.0004.a.success:0 "Your words are very convincing"
 leofring_event_chain.0004.toast.success:0 "Your words are very convincing"
 leofring_event_chain.0004.a.failure:0 "Your words fail to convince anyone"
 leofring_event_chain.0004.toast.failure:0 "Your words fail to convince anyone"
 leofring_event_chain.0004.a.success.tt:0 "[thorlorien_leofring.GetFirstName] converted faith"
 leofring_event_chain.0004.a.failure.tt:0 "[thorlorien_leofring.GetFirstName] was insulted by your attempts"
 leofring_event_chain.0004.b:0 "I do not think I can convince them."
 leofring_event_chain.0004.b.tt:0 "You will return to the Dwimordene to ask the Lady for further instructions"
 leofring_event_chain.0004.c:0 "I should hear #italic their #! version of this matter..."
 leofring_event_chain.0004.c.tt:0 "#N You will receive no further guidance from the Lady#!"
 
 leofring_event_chain.0005.t:0 "Returning to the Dwimordene"
 leofring_event_chain.0005.desc.failure:0 "It is with a heavy heart that I return to the Golden Wood and the treetop city of the Queen of the Fae.\n\n"I have failed in my assignment," I state as she receives me, seemingly already knowing all that transpired across the Great River. "Worry not," she replies, "If they will not be convinced, we must take up arms to remove this threat to our peaceful realm, as regretful as that is."\n\nI must carefully consider if I agree with her suggestion, as war may not be in my best interest at the moment. On the other hand, the freed lands shall be granted to me as the Lady of the Fae is swift to promise - surely this reward is enticing enough?"
 leofring_event_chain.0005.desc:0 "With a heart gladdened by success, I return to the treetop city of the Fae of the Dwimordene. The task has been complete, and the Lady of the Fae receives me with a knowing smile, as if she somehow perceived all that transpired across the Great River.\n\n"You have done well, my friend. The shadows are lessened, and your kinsfolk on the eastern shores of the Anduin shall aid us against the Darkness that tains Greenwood the Great."\n\nI now make ready to return home, but not before asking for a final boon from the Lady..."
 leofring_event_chain.0005.a:0 "Let us forge a lasting alliance."
 leofring_event_chain.0005.a.tt:0 "You will enter a mutual alliance with [galadriel.GetName]"
 leofring_event_chain.0005.b:0 "To war then. We must purge the shadow at all cost."
 leofring_event_chain.0005.c:0 "Grant me control of the lands I freed."
 leofring_event_chain.0005.d:0 "I tire of this. My lands need me."
 leofring_event_chain.0005.d.tt:0 "You will return to your abode"
