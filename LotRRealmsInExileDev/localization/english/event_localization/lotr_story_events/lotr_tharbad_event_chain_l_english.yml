 tharbad_story.0001.t: "The Master of Tharbad"
 tharbad_story.0001.desc: "Twelve years ago [ROOT.Char.GetFirstName] and his band of ruffians seized the city of [GetTitleByKey('d_tharbad_titular').GetNameNoTier] with the help of his wife [ROOT.Char.GetPrimarySpouse.GetFirstName], one of the last [dunedain|E] nobles of the city. Since then, they have ruled the city and the area around it with an iron fist. While they have at least temporarily halted the long, slow decline of the city and managed to boost toll revenue on the Royal Road, Tharbad is still a shell of its former self. But for now, the royal family is content with ruling over the rubble. \n\nHowever, there are rumblings that things might not be what they seem. Whispers of growing discontent with Gurnows avaricious rule and heavy hand. The Master's tactics may have worked in good times, but how he handles a crisis remains to be seen."

And now we are looking at yet another cataclysm in our city's long history. Citizens have already begun petitioning for government help in the crisis, or at a minimum, a temporary pause of the strict travel control laws so they can go and seek aid themselves. They have started to move from polite requests to outright demands for relief. Nevertheless, it's up to the master to decide how to respond."

With the guards in on the plot [ROOT.Char.GetFirstName] stood no chance.
