 tharbad_story.0001.desc: "Twelve years ago [ROOT.Char.GetFirstName] and his band of ruffians seized the city of [GetTitleByKey('d_tharbad_titular').GetNameNoTier] with the help of his wife [ROOT.Char.GetPrimarySpouse.GetFirstName], one of the last [dunedain|E] nobles of the city. Since then, they have ruled the city and the area around it with an iron fist. While they have at least temporarily halted the long, slow decline of the city and managed to boost toll revenue on the Royal Road, Tharbad is still a shell of its former self. But for now, the royal family is content with ruling over the rubble. \n\nHowever, there are rumblings that things might not be what they seem. Whispers of growing discontent with Gurnows avaricious rule and heavy hand. The Master's tactics may have worked in good times, but how he handles a crisis remains to be seen."
