  bountig_event_chain.0010.desc: "For many years now, the lands to our east have been ones of chaos. Since the days when Eorl slew the foul Balchoth Emperor, his former subjects have squabbled like vultures over the corpse of the lands which once formed his realm. It was inevitable that the chaos would spread, and like a blight, it encroaches upon all lands the Easterling touch. Many a raid have the foolish and the hardy aimed against our eastern walls, seeking plunder and land both.\n\nSo it is once again. We have heard messages of an incoming Easterling force - unusually substantial in size and equipment. Thus, we have been summoned to send whatever forces we can spare to ensure that once the foe is defeated, they do not escape into the countryside to pillage while we hunt them down."

What few survived nigh begged for death. Only by the grace of the Gods did I survive, slipping away in the chaos as the battle turned ill.\n\nShaking as a leaf, I abandon my armor. Frantically, I think back to the meetings before it all went wrong, and those maps - such small scraps of paper, and yet now my only survival! At last calming my breath, I open my eyes once more, and find the sun. The hour is late now, and as such I can tell east from west. Death alone awaits me if I go east, west, or north, for the Horsemen were many, and I know they went those ways. So the south alone remains.\n\nA different terror is upon me now. Legends speak of the south - and of those who live there. Men tall as giants, demons of hate made flesh. Our foes of old, it is said. Builders of monumental houses and fortresses my people cannot dream of. Their gazes pierce the mind and read the hearts of those who come before them. If I dare this road, will they slay me? Will they know me? Yet I have no other choice. This is the only path left to me."

  bountig_event_chain.0012.desc: "Despite my own dread, I have managed to enter the lands of the [Concept('gondor','south')|E], escaping those of the [Concept('rohan','horsemen of the green plains')|E]. As the legends say, many of the [Concept('gondorian','folk')|E] here are indeed tall, some standing head and shoulders above me. Yet I have found no demons here yet. Their tongues are strange, and I do not grasp them yet. But they appear to eat food, to laugh and cry as my own folk do. Yet that is where the similarities end. Great houses of stone line roads of finely paved stones. Rich markets resound with merchant cry near and far. And yet among them I count nary a weapon, though the occasional watchmen and soldier in regal silver stands at vigilance.\n\nFrankly, it is overwhelming. I have seen more riches here than I have seen in all my days, and that is before I have even entered the gates of the [Concept('minastirith','great cities')|E] I spy afar! Though some view me with wariness, others pay me no heed, and so I can pass through without harm.\n\nAfter a few days, I manage to encounter a merchant who knows my tongue (if roughly), and who is willing to let me know if there is work that may succor me. As I wait for his word, my mind turns with wonder at the lands around me - perhaps I was always meant to come here. I feel as if my eyes have been opened, and a whole world lies before me."

  bountig_event_chain.0014.t_edhellond: "The Silent Haven"
  bountig_event_chain.0014.desc_minas_tirith: "[minastirith|E], the locals call it. Madness may be more appropriate! It is as much a mountain as a city, formed of seven rising layers, each with their own wall so tall that they must have surely been wrought by giants! Surely not even the walls of Mistrand, supposedly crafted by the hands of gods, can compare to such.\n\nWithin the walls thrum hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands of souls, dressed in finery and speaking in the odd dual tongues of this land. Fine houses, market places, fountains and even parks are built in the great concentric rings, and many more delved into the rock face itself - taverns, storehouses, armories, libraries and more.\n\nI am told the highest levels are reserved to the upper nobility and the ruler of Gondor themselves. Such a fortress as this could not be taken even if all the tribes of the grass seas were gathered together. Though it does make me wonder what foe could the builders of such a citadel fear, to wrought it so?"
  bountig_event_chain.0014.desc_dol_amroth: "[dol_amroth|E], supposedly named after a sort of sprite of myth, is an imposing city, with high ramparts guarded by stern men. The people here are, almost to a man, tall, with many clean-shaven. The women are beautiful, and even the lowest of means (dressed in finery to shame me) speak almost exclusively in the flowery tongue I have heard in other regions.\n\nWandering around the city, I spy knights on horseback, their heavy armor like nothing I have ever seen. Banners with a winged swan can be found on every street corner. Yet there is more to it than that. In one section of the city I can find a public forum, with teachers and scholars hosting classes - some free! Much of it passes me by, as my grasp on the tongue is rudimentary at best, but I still come away impressed.\n\nI hear every now and again a bell faintly ringing, marking the hours as they pass, carried on the seaward breeze as ships come to dock beneath the city in the port."
  bountig_event_chain.0014.desc_pelargir: "I have heard much of this city on the way. The largest in Gondor, some claim. The true heart of the realm, in days of old a second capital. The berth of their mighty fleets of old, and even now home to many a merchant and military vessel.\n\nI cannot truly judge, but regardless, it is truly impressive. Seemingly half-built in the sea itself, the mighty rivers that join here flow through the heart of the city itself - with quays and drydocks aplenty astride them. At its core is a mighty isle, completely paved over, the very land and sea mastered by brilliant engineers. A sacred tower reportedly is at the isle's heart, with access forbidden to commoners.\n\nA ferry supposedly regularly runs between Pelargir and the lands across the Great River, and is always in need of hands. Here more than anywhere in Gondor, folk of different lands have gathered, lending the port city a truly unique atmosphere. Its grand market is also, as a result, the most strange and exotic of all I have seen."
  bountig_event_chain.0014.desc_linhir: "The largest city between Pelargir and Dol Amroth, Linhir is no less impressive. A strong port, it has walls which purportedly are among the oldest in the realm - older than any others.\n\nIt has a small dedicated squadron berthed in its quays, designated for patrolling the coastal regions, either for strays lost or pirates.\n\nThe city supposedly has had a somewhat contentious history, as it straddles between two of Gondor's most populous and influential regions - Belfalas and Lebennin. I am told it possesses a stubborn and independent spirit, with the merchants and city fathers often seeking to answer to none but the highest authority of the greater realm, rather than a regional lord. They take pride in their city and their homes, and it is obvious in the many sigils and banners that can be found throughout it."
  bountig_event_chain.0014.desc_serelond: "Serelond, I am told, was once a city of exiles. Specifically, it was where those who had lost favor in Pelargir would opt to retire - whether permanently or temporarily would depend on many factors. It then was a two-fold city of exiles, for it became the dwelling of those who most chafed under the newfound authority of Gondor's kings.\n\nHowever, in time the Kings asserted their power and reigned in the rebellious city, but the reality of its distance from Gondor's heart has not changed, thus fostering a somewhat independent spirit. The people here pride themselves on self-reliance and being able to handle their problems without the aid of Minas Tirith. However, this does have its downsides. It is a smaller city to be sure, and many of the fineries and that can be found in the east of Gondor cannot be gotten here. As a result though, it has developed a unique cuisine culture, steeped in the local specialties, such as fish and lamb."
  bountig_event_chain.0014.desc_cair_andros: "Cair Andros is an island turned into a fortress. That is my first thought, and that is just reinforced as I explore it.\n\nOh, there is more than just fortresses - but it is obvious that the houses are only here because of the fortresses.\n\nThe towers and forts have been judiciously placed around the isle, but are apparent in their age in some places. Yet even despite that age, they remain masterworks of construction and planning, seemingly arranged in such a way as to allow for a concerted defender to hold the entire isle until reinforcement arrive, even with limited manpower. While I am obviously not permitted to see inside myself, I can only imagine the weapons within the keeps, waiting to assail any who would attack the isle."
  bountig_event_chain.0014.desc_hyarpende: "The oldest city on the eastern side of the Anduin, Hyarpendë is in many ways a mirror of Pelargir, to which it has always been intertwined historically. From this city runs the Harad road, which in earlier days carried goods and settlers south from Gondor to the now contested and hostile lands to its south.\n\n As a result, it is both the gate to and guardian of the south. Travelers are both the lifeblood and the greatest threat to the city, and as such a vigilance watch is kept. From the ferry to Pelargir disembark troops moving to their stations in the militarized frontiers of Harondor, and others going the other way who are being re-assigned.\n\nUnlike much of Gondor, it's location (and the northward retreat of Gondor's border) has resulted in a not unsubstantial 'Southron Quarter', where the tongues of the folk of the south can be heard freely and more often. These hardy folk, often rebels or otherwise exiles from the lands of the south, have proven surprisingly loyal to the Winged Crown, and form an important part of the frontier's continuing resilience."
  bountig_event_chain.0014.desc_edhellond: "Empty Edhellond is in equal parts serene and haunting. A city trapped in time, Edhellond was once a bustling haven of the Sindar Elves, and their influence can be seen everywhere: from murals and elegant patterns that are carved into pillars and walls, to the marble buildings and quaysides that gleam and glitter in the sunlight.\n\nNow, however, all is quiet. It has been a millennium since the city was inhabited, the last inhabitants sailing west after the fall of Khazad-Dûm, leaving behind the ill-fated Amroth. Yet it said if you listen closely enough, and for long enough, you can still hear faintly the fair voices of those who lived here all that time ago."
  bountig_event_chain.0014.a_minas_tirith: "The Tower of Guard indeed..."
  bountig_event_chain.0014.a_dol_amroth: "For whom does the bell toll?"
  bountig_event_chain.0014.a_pelargir: "Well... I do have a little money saved up...."
  bountig_event_chain.0014.a_linhir: "Perhaps a little pride is not a bad thing!"
  bountig_event_chain.0014.a_serelond: "Truly, self-reliance is a virtue, I have learned."
  bountig_event_chain.0014.a_cair_andros: "Is there any ship more deadly than an island?"
  bountig_event_chain.0014.a_hyarpende: "I wonder what wonders lurk south beyond the border?"

Located on the eastern shore of the [seaofrhun|E], its high walls cast long shadows upon the golden plains, and through its gates pass merchants and mercenaries alike. As with any city, intrigue happens in the shadows and in the bustling markets; intrigue which is, on the whole, irrelevant to us. For the Easterlings are disunited, and the bickering of countless warring clans and tribes has rent Rhûn. So it has been for many years, much to our advantage.\n\nYet from the north travelling merchants and traders now bring me more troubling rumours. One [bountigmedlokan.GetFirstName], a former mercenary who has grown in popularity amongst the people and lords of [GetTitleByKey('c_mistrand').GetNameNoTier], has instead preached a message of unity amongst the Easterling lords, encouraging them to instead join forces against foreign enemies and overlords.\n\nUs included. The disunity of the Easterling lands offers plenty of opportunities for pillage and tribute, but if this northern savage succeeds in his quest, then the new Easterling realm might not only strip us of tributaries, but pose an existential threat."

The threat posed by this to our interests and very existence cannot be underestimated.\n\nKhand is also disunited, just as Rhûn is; in this the Variags and Easterlings are one and the same, I fear.

It appears my peaceful overtures to my neighbors have caused alarm in [rhun|E], and more lords have flocked to [bountigmedlokan.GetHisHer] banner. Now the Easterlings have begun to put aside their differences, inaugurating their Grand Alliance.\n\nIf I do not act now, the northern savages will start attacking our enterprising travelers, and ignoring our tolls and the rightful tribute we are owed!\n\nI find new resolve as I raise myself from my throne. I have united [GetTitleByKey('k_upper_khand').GetNameNoTier]. My will and determination are as strong as ever. The task to save my people is mine!\n\nI will set out to rally all of [GetTitleByKey('e_khand').GetNameNoTier] into a single realm, able to sweep away the Easterlings like leaves in the wind!"

All have since heard of the meteoric rise of [bountigmedlokan.GetFirstName] and his Grand Alliance, and most of them understand what threat now looms on our northern borders.\n\nThey have bent the knee before me, confirming me as the sole ruler of all of Khand! And I shall not forget my promises to them; I shall lead them to glorious victory! Gold and plunder shall flow as it has the past two centuries, and [rhun|E] shall remember its place - beneath the hoof of [GetTitleByKey('e_khand').GetNameNoTier]!\n\nAs it befits my new rank, there is only one name for me to adopt upon accepting the crown..."
