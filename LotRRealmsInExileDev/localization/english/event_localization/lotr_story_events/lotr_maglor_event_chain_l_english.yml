To fight [sauroncharacter|E], I shall need to plan carefully. Two paths lie before me. Try to rally what Elves I can and take the fight to Sauron directly? Or assert my claim (though questionable) to the position of High-king, before leveraging that power to defeat Sauron?"

  maglor_event_chain.0006.desc: "It was believed with the ending of the [firstage|E] and the loss of the [silmarils|E], never again would such a tragedy as the Kinslayings come again.\n\nThis has been proven a false hope. Maglor Fëanorian has participated in three kinslayings, and each one it is said he did with great sorrow and reluctance - yet he did them the same. Now, seeking the crown of the [noldorelves|E], he has begun a fourth. But this will be no single city engulfed in the fires of war. No, this may well consume all of [GetTitleByKey('e_lindon').GetNameNoTier], which not even Sauron could succeed in marring.\n\nIt has begun, and it seems nothing can stop it - save victory, or death."

A people battered, until no resistance remains.\n\nMaglor Fëanorian has put down all those who would resist his claim to mastery of the [noldorelves|E], and to the lands of [GetTitleByKey('e_lindon').GetNameNoTier]. He has shown mercy where he might, but the brutality of a fourth kinslaying made manifest has etched yet another scar into [ardaconcept|E] that shall never truly fade.\n\nTime shall tell if it was worth it..."
  maglor_event_chain.0010.a: "So it ends."

  # Maglor loses the war
  maglor_event_chain.0015.t: "The End of the House of Fëanor"
  maglor_event_chain.0015.desc: "A wretched end for a house which has fallen from its ancient heights. [maglor.GetFirstName] Fëanorian's desperate gamble to claim the throne of [GetTitleByKey('e_noldor').GetNameNoTier]... has failed. His armies (what few rallied to him) have been routed or placed in bonds, to face judgement. But Maglor himself would face no judgement from the [elves|E] of [middleearth|E].\n\nNo, Maglor now must face the judgement of a higher power - the [valar|E], for Maglor Fëanorian lives no longer. Slain in the final battle, it is an ignoble end to what was once the mightiest house of the [noldorelves|E]. Many ponder at Maglor's final days, and what madness gripped him. The kinder hope that [mandoscharacter|E] shall provide him the healing he so evidently needed."

  # Shield of the Free Peoples
  maglor_event_chain.0020.t: "The Heir of Eregion"
  maglor_event_chain.0020.desc: "There are many threats which have slowly choked the Free Peoples. The [dwarves|E] have lost their great realms of old, the [elves|E] are diminished and split apart from each other. To defeat [sauroncharacter|E], we must be united. To unite, these threats must be quelled. \n\nSuch was my decision. The first step is to cleanse the Misty Mountains and restore the Dwarves, our allies of ancient days. There is an obvious place for us to begin this work, then - Eregion, the realm of my nephew [celebrimbor|E]. The ancient ruins of the kingdom have decayed but with work can be rebuilt. The close proximity to [khazaddum|E] makes it an ideal location from which to begin the work of cleansing it. \n\nSo we set out, leaving behind [GetTitleByKey('c_himring').GetNameNoTier] and [GetTitleByKey('e_lindon').GetNameNoTier], marching forth for what may be the final war of the High-Elves."

Comparatively, the Elves are fewer, but none can doubt their skill and valor. While once disorganized, my leadership skills have proven themselves not so rusted as I thought.\n\nNow both sides work together ably, though perhaps still not to the level of the great Mannish-Elven armies of Beleriand of old. Our fleet is somewhat motley, with graceful oarless Elven-craft berthed alongside lumbering Gondorian ships. Yet I have faith. A new note is in the air, a new chorus to the song, one perhaps not originally intended but adding a unique harmony to it.\n\nPenance begins here, by fire and sword and hate of evil which will not rest ere the breaking of the world. Let the flame of Fëanor burn once more, and incinerate all darkness."

  maglor_event_chain.0069.desc: "And in the dark tower, legend says that a battle ensued such as had not been seen since the Elder Days. \n\n#EMP And flame before blackest pit spake, before the incarnate of hate. Who rose then from his darkened throne, and spoke ruinous words of woe. Of oaths spoke in youthful days, of blood stained upon the quays\n\nIn reply the flame then sung, of sorrow and of endless tears, of star set high above all fears. Of sorrow deeper than the sea, of good will turned to ill indeed. But though the tears unending flow, still yet unbowed to lord of woes; to build anew and mend aright, the sorrows born in grief-filled nights.\n\nAnd the Shadow sung of falling night, of oaths betrayed and friends to flight. Of shattered halls and rivers of flame, of sorrow and of hate-filled bane.#"

  maglor_event_chain.0070.desc: "#EMP The last of seven replied, of hate that would never die. Of war that would not abate, ere the ending of all days. Of love deeper than the earth below, though not of blood, truth would show. Of the flame which cannot die, though malice smothers all under sky. Of embers fanned to flames of war, the rising of the sun of morn.\n\nTo this the Shadow made reply, what flame is this that cannot die? To embers shall fall all flames, as must end the sun each day. The Dark within all hearts remains, the truth revealed on bloody quays.\n\nFlames of war and hate fanned high, consuming all beneath the sky. Abandoned is the world of Men, no Power shall avail them then.\n\nA gentler song he then did raise - why not build a better way? This land may yet fair be made, if our hands be joined and not estranged. Of Order pure and land made great, perfect and all in place.# "

Yet bloody turned the dream of old, for one soul's greed and tyrant's throne.\n\nA rightful king shall keep his own, by their wills, not chains of gold. To order world by common cause, not by whip and savage throng.\n\nAnd this song, flawed and frail, shall be the one which shall prevail. For lo, behold, behind me stand, free people from all lands! Hate endures, but so does love, and the flame within shall stir us up!\n\nTo this no song could make reply, the darkness roaring with a cry.\n\nAnd before that flame which shone, the Dark Lord fell from his high throne. His spirit quailed, his song wained, and in terror he flew away. From the West there came a wind, and through the clouds the light streamed in. The Land of Shadows came to light, and all his armies set to flight. The tower quaked, the mountains sang, and the shadow gave way to day.#"

He shall not return, his spirit broken and unhoused.\n\nDespite the jubilant cheers of my victorious forces, my mind turns inexorably to the future. Though Sauron is beaten, much of his taint remains in the world, to be uprooted and cleansed. It would be a fitting burden, one worthy of Maedhros - to fight the darkness unceasingly.\n\nYet I am not Maedhros. I am Maglor, and I am weary and spent, as a cloth that has grown thin with long years of weather and toil. The sea calls to me once more."

  maglor_event_chain.0076.desc: "And so I return to the shore, gazing out alone. My task is finished. [sauroncharacter|E] is no more. Yet from the tranquil depths slowly rises a mighty wave, and as it does, my heart twists painfully, and alarm fills my mind. It comes ashore, and with a great voice speaks.\n\n"Peace, Makalaurë!\n\n"My lord [ulmocharacter|E]", I reply faintly.\n\n"Long ago, you were told that not even the echo of your lamentations would be heard. Yet I say to you that long I have listened, as you wandered upon my shores. Your songs of regret, sorrow, and pain. The [houseoffeanor|E], and you, have long been in the debates of Máhanaxar. And in our counsel we are now split. Little pity you were promised, but little is not none, and our own failings in the affairs of thy house we have grappled with.\n\nTwo [ages|E] ago, the [banofthevalarshort|E] was ended for all but the most unrepentent or of deepest sins. For two Ages of the world you have repented bitterly, wandering alone and sundered from thy house. Now at the ending of the [eldar|E]'s age, you took upon yourself a task thought impossible, and succeeded despite our deepest doubts. You have wrought a new theme in the great song, and in it we see the echo of the words of our own father, that from evil may come the greater beauty and good. Our counsel is split, and thus we came to a compromise, for I bear a gift."\n\nHe unfurled his hand, and lo! Light undwindled shone forth, brilliant and pure. For in his hand laid the [silmaril|E] that long ago I had cast into the depths of the sea, which had rightly burned me in judgement for my sins.\n\n"[vardacharactershort|E] shall be thy judge, and the works of thy father's own hands. Once you entrusted it to me - now I return it to you."\n\nAnd with that, he turned his hand over and let the jewel - the jewel for which gods, Elves, and mortals had died and slain for - fall."

  maglor_event_chain.0077.desc: "The [silmaril|E] falls, and my hand instinctively grasps it. I give a sharp inhale of breath, bracing for the pain to come, as it surely must. But it does not. Or at least, not as it once did.\n\nThe jewel hums in my hand, its subtle and incomparable melody like crystal in my ears. It does not burn me, yet I am not totally at ease either. It is warm. Uncomfortably so. I say this aloud, gazing at [ulmocharacter|E].\n\nHe rumbles with a voice like a tidal wave, a seeming hint of approval. \n\n"So you are judged. Hear then the words of the [valar|E]. Once, your were exiled - first for your oath, then your crimes, and finally your refusal to accept our offer of judgement. Yet you did none gladly, and for long years you have repented, lamenting in regret no less bitterly than if you had gone to [mandoscharacter|E]. Good does not erase evil, nor evil good, but both are signs of what is within thy heart. And thy heart has proven true, though much sorrow all have endured to show it! Thus we chose the path of mercy, and lay down our Ban."\n\n"I shall add to this not a command, but an earnest entreatment. You are worn, Makalaurë - scars upon thy soul and thy psyche evident to me. Sail into the West, and seek the gardens of Lórien, where you may heal, and so in turn heal others. But for now I shall bid thee farewell! May thy song be gladder when next I hear it."\n\nWith a great crash, the Lord of the Deep descends into his domain, leaving me alone, with but the Silmaril and the stars. All at once, my weariness crashes down on me like a great burden, long ignored. The Sea sings to me a song of peace, of mending, of reconciliation and righting of wrongs. It is the pride of my father and the laughter of my brothers, my youth that was lost in flames and shadow, Elvenhome lost to time and memory, the smile of my mother and the courage of my sons. I have never desired anything more."
