 purge_of_ray.0120.desc: "With [mardat.GetTitledFirstName]'s rise to power over [ray|e], the once stable and prosperous realm has been thrown into absolute chaos. Already, [mardat.GetFirstName]'s loyalist and fresh convert to the Cult of Khäz-gramaze have begun indiscriminate mass purges and killings of all who refuse to abandon their faith and embrace the God of Night and his teachings. \n\nOld Vâtran elites and new Kât-Polozây upstart claimants alike have taken up arms against the new Kralyi's tyranny yet many fear that [mardat.GetTitledFirstName]'s foreing backers will ensure his hold on power stays firm no matter how hard they struggle."

 #Story
 purge_of_ray.0416.t: "Sunset over Rây"
 purge_of_ray.0416.desc: "The Aûdrat Vâtra is no more. For centuries its followers, and the wider Kanivâtra order of [ray|e], brought the realm nothing but weakness and centuries long submission. No more! The hearthlands of [GetTitleByKey('k_ray').GetNameNoTier] are now under secure Khäz-gramaze rule and it would take a truly disastrous mistake for it to ever be broken. \n\nWith my position secured, my gaze now turns to the hinterlands. Though the Vâtran have been crushed, the revolutionary Kât-Polozây continue to pose a major threat to the hinterlands of the realm. For now, however, I can celebrate my victory over the last of my foes among the reactionaries."
 purge_of_ray.0416.a: "The hearthlands are mine."

 purge_of_ray.0417.t: "Iunást Broken"
 purge_of_ray.0417.desc: "The Kât-Polozây have, at last, been brought to utter ruin. Their doomed attempt to rebel against my rule and the true faith of Khäz-gramaze having brought them nothing but death and ruin, as is the lot of heretics. With their fall, the last leaders of the organized resistance against my rule have fallen. None in [ray|e] are in a position to challenge my power and none will ever be again. \n\nIn the name of Khäz-gramaze, I have brougth ruin to the Citadel of Kâtri. The temple there had become a hotbed of rebellion and as such it had to be destroyed. With it, died the last monument to a [GetTitleByKey('k_ray').GetNameNoTier] before the coming of Khäz-gramaze and though the Kât-Polozây despair at the loss of their holy site, the followers of the true faith rejoice at the unmaking of this monument to heresy."
 purge_of_ray.0417.a: "How sad it is that the foundations could not burn..."

 purge_of_ray.0418.t: "The Serpent Dynasty"
 purge_of_ray.0418.desc: "After years of effort, of plotting and of work, I have achieved my ultimate goal. The old order of [ray|e], Aûdrat Vâtra and Kât-Polozây alike, is dead and gone. Their weak rule, which had led [GetTitleByKey('k_ray').GetNameNoTier] to nothing more than eternal stagnation as the weakest of the so-called great realms of the [bayoftulwang|e], is at long last fully overthrown. \n\nIn the place of the Kanivâtra, I am ascendent. My absolute rule over the realm is unquestionned and uncontested. Everywhere I look, I see fresh converts to the Cult of Khäz-gramaze and zealous prayers where there were once only godless merchants wishing for nothing else than gold. At long last, [GetTitleByKey('k_ray').GetNameNoTier] has reached the greatness and potential it always had, hidden behind the decadence of its false faiths. \n\nThe time is right, and my declaration goes unchallenged. I am [root_scope.GetTitledFirstName], first of the Serpent Dynasty."
 purge_of_ray.0418.a: "Blessed by Khäz-gramaze, our rule shall last forever!"

 #Maintenance
 purge_of_ray.0001.t: "The Serpent that Slew the Sun"
 purge_of_ray.0001.desc: "After years of brutal purges and religious civil wars, [ray|e], one among the greatest realms of Far [harad|e], has been secured under the rule of the fanatical followers of the Cult of Khäz-gramaze. Though the many traditionalist and revolutionary factions of the realm tried to overthrow [ruler_ray.GetTitledFirstName], their numbers were defeated by the sheer might and zeal of the new regime's cruel enforcers. \n\nThough [ruler_ray.GetTitledFirstName] and his loyalists rejoice at the fall of the last lords to oppose their dominion, [ray.GetNameNoTier] has been devastated by its bloody civil war and it may take years for it to recover to its old strength. In the short term, however, Khäz-gramaze rule over [ray.GetNameNoTier] seems assured."

 purge_of_ray.0001.d: "We will endure even this..."
 purge_of_ray.0001.e: "Rây has truly been lost..."

 purge_of_ray.0002.t: "The Second Herald"
 purge_of_ray.0002.desc: "After [mardat.GetFirstName]'s overthrow of the Kanivâtra and much of the old Vâtran order of [ray|e], many followers of the Aûdrat Vâtra feared that their place in [GetTitleByKey('k_ray').GetNameNoTier] had truly been lost. Yet, [ruler_ray.GetTitledFirstName] proved those fears wrong. Indeed, with [CharYourHerHis(ruler_ray)] rise to power the Khäz-gramaze upstarts of the realm have beem defeated and their ambitions to enfore their radial faith thwarthed \n\nTo many in [harad|e], this brings great relief as fundamentalist Khäz-gramaze domination in [ray.GetNameNoTier] could well have sent the ancient balance of the South, especially in the [bayoftulwang|e]. Nevertheless, the Purge of Rây was devastating and it will take years until the realm recovers to its former strength."

 purge_of_ray.0002.e: "A glorious day!"
 purge_of_ray.0002.f: "Rây will learn its place soon enough!"

 purge_of_ray.0003.t: "Uncertain Times"
 purge_of_ray.0003.desc: "The bitter conflict that has raged between Khäz-gramaze rulers and the old guard of Rây has ravaged both sides, with truly unexpected results.\n\nThe [ruler_ray.GetFaith.GetCollectiveNounNoTooltip] now control the scepter of [ray.GetNameNoTier], [ruler_ray.GetTitledFirstName] presiding from the seat of power over the damaged and broken lands. The Purge of Rây has died away as a result, the warring factions no longer able to prosecute their quarrel.\n\nThe future of the realm is uncertain, and much remains uncertain in these times of transition."
 purge_of_ray.0003.a: "I shall best the squabbling gods of [ray.GetNameNoTier]!"
 purge_of_ray.0003.b: "Interesting"

 purge_of_ray.0004.t: "Pride of Iunást"
 purge_of_ray.0004.desc: "In a turn of event shocking many in [ray|e], the long dominated followers of the Kât-Polozây have been able to reastablish their rule over their ancient realm after centuries of Aûdrat Vâtra domination. The bloody and devastating purges orchestrated by the usurper [mardat.GetFirstName] in his attempt to bring the Cult of Khäz-gramaze to the realm at all costs only enflamed the long dormant fires of rebellion within the people of [ray.GetNameNoTier]. In the end, the squabbling followers of Khäz-gramaze and the old Vâtran order only destroyed each other, leaving the door open for [ruler_ray.GetTitledFirstName] to claim power for the Kât Polozây. \n\nTo many in [ray.GetNameNoTier], and even across wider [harad|e], this day is an occasion for great celebration but the ravages of [mardat.GetFirstName]'s purge will take years to be repaired."
 purge_of_ray.0004.a: "The sun has at last set on the tyrants of Rây!"

 purge_of_ray.0004.e: "Our time has passed, it seems..."
 purge_of_ray.0004.f: "How could this have happened!"

 purge_of_ray.1000.desc: "Day after day, I get reports of thriving heretical communities prospering despite their blatant disrepsect for my rule and my laws. Under the protection of [aetheling.GetTitledFirstName], these rebels continue to live normal lives. However, their treacherous peace is fragile indeed... \n\nIf I were to send out my men to burn their fields and villages, I could subdue these rebels through famine and terror. Wether I simply kill them all to make future integration easier or I use my power to force loyalty and submission from the locals this is a great opportunity to further my power."

 purge_of_ray.1005.desc: "In recent times, the Rîyesha, greatest of the rivers of [ray|e], has seen far less use than it had ever before under Vâtran rule. My advisor, [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMe', SCOPE.sC('marshal'))] [marshal.GetFirstName], tells me that while some of this is due to the many vile heretics who still refuse to embrace Khäz-gramaze, the river's infrastructure has also fallen into despair. \n\nAs the only sea route into the realm's interior, maintaining the Rîyesha's infrastructure in a workable state is critical to maintaining my rule over the realm. Yet, I could also seek out to actively sabotage travel on the river so as to starve out the many rebels of the interior..."

 purge_of_ray.1015.desc: "Recently, a base of hidden heretical rebels against my rule has been found in [offending_village.GetName]. Needless to say, now that I know of their presence these fools will be quickly dealt with. Yet, I can't help but think that the villagers who dared to hide these rebels and their men among them are just as guily of treason as the ones they hid. \n\nIt would be so very easy to simply wipe out these peasants, none of which even follow Khäz-gramaze to begin with, and this case offers me the perfect justification to carry out more #EMP desicive #!action against these vile heretics.

 purge_of_ray.1016.t: "Roads of Despair"
 purge_of_ray.1016.desc: "Many among the cowardly and treacherous heretics still hiding in the [offending_village.GetName] have begun fleeing from the city. At first, they were mostly small bands, doomed to die out in the wilderness, but in recent times the flow of escapees has grown to dangerous proportions. Not only does this depopulation weaken Khäz-gramaze power, these desperates traitors make for perfect soldiers for the damned rebel cause. \n\nWhile I could handle the issue by sending a proper purging force to the city and killing any that would consider fleeing, this wouldn't solve the fundamental issue. Perhaps a good option could be to instead have my men hunt down these heretics and bring them back to the city?"
 purge_of_ray.1016.a: "Send my men and destroy any resistance."
 purge_of_ray.1016.b: "Hunt them down to the last!"
 purge_of_ray.1016.c: "Let them leave and die out on their own..."

 purge_of_ray.1017.t: "A Land in Ruin"
 purge_of_ray.1017.desc: "Despite the great prosperity my rule has brought to [ray|e], it seems that that the [offending_village.GetName] has somehow found a way to enter into chronic decline. The trade roads, long arteries of life and wealth for the realm, have seemingly dried up there leaving the land in economic despair. Paired with the foul heretics still running rampant through the land, the future of the [offending_village.GetName] truly seems to be on the line. \n\nAs Kralyi, it is my duty to look out for my people, of course, but it seems clear to me that the situation largely stems from the foolish fears and laziness of the local people. All it would take would be a few men to put the locals to work or some small investment to get things back to normal."
 purge_of_ray.1017.a: "Put the locals to work."
 purge_of_ray.1017.b: "Perhaps greater investment could work..."

 purge_of_ray.1018.desc: "Exploiting the chaos of the purge, a large band of mercenaries turned bandits have begun rampaging through the lands of [aetheling.GetTitledFirstName], causing great damage everywhere they go. The opportunity in this situation is not lost to me. Indeed, if I were to hire these mercenaries now, I would have good men in a perfect position to bring the purge in full force to [aetheling.GetTitledFirstName]'s lands. \n\nIf I am to hire these men, there seem to be two broad choices for me. Either I can keep there exactly where they are, running rampant but now spreading the shadow of Khäz-gramaze, or I could hire them to serve me directly. Yet, I must consider that my finances are limited and that simply letting this rampagage continue does already serve my goals."

While [aetheling.GetTitledFirstName] assures me that, in time, the rebels will be utterly crushed, [CharYourHerHis(aetheling)] realm would greatly benefit from direct aid on my part. \n\nWhile it would be a somehwat costly endeavor, I could redirect my men to the [crop_duchy.GetName] to bring back order and crack down on heresy in one great strike. Yet, I must also consider that these funds could be crucial in winning the many battles left to fight to truly secure my rule over [ray|e]."

 purge_of_ray.1020.desc: "It has been brought to my attention that the people of the [offending_village.GetName] have largely seemed to abandon their heretical faith. Indeed, it seems that my great showing of force and repeated victories have made them lose faith in their lesser gods, leaving them ripe for becoming new converts to the Cult of Khäz-gramaze. Yet, not all news from the [offending_village.GetName] are this good. Indeed, it seems that a strange unaligned cult has recently begun gaining popularity among the locals. \n\nWhile this fledgling cult is unlikely to survive a serious attempt at converting the locals, if I am to act I must do so now or risk this affair growing out of control..."
 purge_of_ray.1020.a: "The priests of Khäz-gramaze shall put them back in place."
