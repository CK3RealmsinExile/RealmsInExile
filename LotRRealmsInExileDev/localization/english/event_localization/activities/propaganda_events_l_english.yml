 propaganda.0001.desc:0 "I ponder over the vast swathes of land and indigenous people of [middleearth|E] ruled by the ancient [adunai|E], before the [akallabeth|E]. If I am to rebuild that long lost glory, it is paramount that all in my realm understand their place as subjects to the superior Adûnâi.\n\nThus, by my decree, all town criers and artists in my domain, and that of my vassals, will be required to cultivate submission in my realm. This will be done by a retelling of the lore of the world and the Adûnâi’s place in it.\n\nI must focus my efforts on a fitting narrative."

 # Of Castamir and the ruin of Gondor

 propaganda.0010.t:0 "Seeds of Strife"
 propaganda.0010.desc:0 "In days past, the [adunai|E] of [gondor|E], reigned with great strength, provided to them by the legacy of [westernesse|E]. Their cities were vast, their fortresses were strong, their armies were supreme, and their mastery was unchallenged. Foolish as they now are, they were still Adûnâi - thus it was their divine right to guide and rule the Middle Men of Gondor. Alas, the folly of our northern kin prevailed when they lost their way, forsaking their high heritage in exchange for temporary advantage.\n\nThese misguided and naive fools lost their way by mingling their own blood with that of the common men of [middleearth|E]. This travesty occurred when king Valacar of Gondor, in the year 1250 of the [thirdage|E], decided to wed the daughter of a barbaric king from [rhovanion|E], seeking to align this violent but powerful people to himself. Thus was a prince born to Gondor, an heir to its ancient throne, that was raised in the backwaters of Middle-Earth, with nary a thought for the high refinement and nobility of his forefathers.\n\nThus, the blood of the indeginous denizens of Endor seeped into the royal line and nobles of Gondor. As king Valacar grew old, his son Eldacar took reign in his place. In effect, this was the first king of mixed blood in Gondor. As the past has shown time and again, for stability and prosperity to endure for all peoples - the Adûnâi must reign without dissent and the meddling of Middle Men."
 propaganda.0010.a:0 "Adûnâi rulers should know better than to desecrate their blood."
 propaganda.0010.b:0 "A king raised in a thatched barn could never rule a kingdom of marble."
 propaganda.0010.c:0 "The armies of Gondor crumbled due to neglect."
 

 propaganda.0011.t:0 "A Kingdom in Shambles"
 propaganda.0011.desc:0 "During the reign of Eldacar, the realm fell into calamity which the kingdom has not fully recovered from even today. It all started with Eldacar putting so-called nobles from the [rhovanion_kingdom|E] into positions of power and responsibility. The king also allowed his royal decrees and laws to be influenced by the wants and wishes of the unworthy [northmen|E], aliens foreign to [gondor|E] and its people. This incompetence was clearly a result of his heritage clouding the noble and righteous judgement of [westernesse|E]. The boorish king’s reign led to a series of unfortunate and fatal events for all the people of Gondor.\n\nThe crown’s coffers were mismanaged. Corruption arose as pickpockets and thieves took office in the king’s court. The cities and castles started to crumble, and the architects of the realm forgot the ancient art of [numenorean|E] stonemasonry. The people in all the fiefdoms starved and great suffering ensued. Had it not been for the king bearing some measure of [adunai|E] heritage and competence through his father, the whole realm of Gondor would surely have been completely lost to mismanagement."
 propaganda.0011.a:0 "This is why the subjects of Adûnâi must abide by our demands."
 propaganda.0011.b:0 "Surely the blood of Anadûnê must always prevail – for the betterment of all."
 propaganda.0011.c:0 "To allow Middle Men to wield power alongside oneself... Blasphemy."

 propaganda.0012.t:0 "A Headstrong King"
 propaganda.0012.desc:0 "During the reign of Eldacar, the old wisdom borne out of the West was forsaken. The [gondorian|E] people eventually found their salvation in the second cousin of the king, Castamir the Saviour, Captain of the Ships and righteous ruler of Pelargir.\n\nCastamir was a man of strong blood, which was apparent by his noble stature, wisdom and the iron will to do what was necessary for the good of all [conceptracemen|E]. The people of [gondor|E] rallied around him to depose king Eldacar, who by now was known as the Tyrant King.\n\nAt first the Castamir tried a diplomatic course of action. He requested that Eldacar see reason and presented a series of policies and decrees that would be for the betterment of the realm. The king saw red at this request, and his barbaric upbringing got the better of him; he initiated the slaughter of innocent subjects of the realm clamouring for a ruler with the wisdom of [westernesse|E] - clamouring for Castamir. He then banished Castamir from the city of [osgiliath|E] under the pain of death. Castamir left the city for Pelargir, where he devised a plan to save the kingdom."
 propaganda.0012.a:0 "Thus, there was undeniable proof that all Men needed Adûnaic chaperones."
 propaganda.0012.b:0 "If only Eldacar had listened, Gondor would have been saved."
 propaganda.0012.c:0 "Castamir should have slain Eldacar and all his barbaric retainers that day."

 propaganda.0013.t:0 "The Tyrant's Downfall"
 propaganda.0013.desc:0 "Castamir wasted no time. He rallied a large army of the most noble and righteous men in [gondor|E] and marched upon [osgiliath|E], where Eldacar hid in his throne room. The saviour tried to take the capital and depose the tyrant while sparing the city and the lives its inhabitants. The king, however, would have none of it.\n\nEldacar threw away the lives of his soldiers and set the city ablaze in an effort to stop the virtuous assault of Castamir. Osgiliath, the city of the Host of Stars, crown jewel of Gondor, was set ablaze. Its great bridges were ruined, and the Tower of the Stone toppled into the river [anduin|E].\n\nIn spite of the superior force of king Eldacar and his will to stoop to amoral and unscrupulous tactics in the battle – Castamir still managed to defeat the Tyrant. In his cowardice, Eldacar fled north to his kin in [rhovanion|E]. The captured son and heir of Eldacar, Ornendil, swore to bring death and destruction to all of Gondor as a response to the people's uprising. Tragically, the vile prince was killed during an escape attempt, after brutaly murdering one of his keepers.\n\nAt the people’s request, Castamir was crowned king of Gondor. During his reign the cities were rebuilt, famine and disease were eradicated and the people rejoiced. Never since the days of [numenor|E] had an [adunaic|E] kingdom seen such prosperity."
 propaganda.0013.a:0 "Castamir was a great general, a master of Adûnaic warfare."
 propaganda.0013.b:0 "Castamir immediately laid plans for the rebuilding fair Osgiliath."
 propaganda.0013.c:0 "That escape attempt incident was fortuitous."

 propaganda.0014.t:0 "The Return of the Tyrant and the Fall of the Righteous"
 propaganda.0014.desc:0 "After ten years of prosperity in [gondor|E], the deposed Tyrant returned with an overwhelming army of roving bandits and barbarians. In his employ were also Middle Men of the realm, turned to evil by bribery, coercion and the promise of their own fiefdoms in Gondor. Eldacar trespassed upon Gondor’s borders under cover of night, with the help from traitorous [northmen|E] watchmen from [calenardhon|E].\n\nToo late was Castamir aware of the impending threat, and he had little time to rally his forces. Nonetheless, ever the honourable and dutiful king, Castamir proudly rode out with a small force of his best men to meet the threat.\n\nA great battle ensued at the crossing of Erui, where King Castamir's forces were greatly outnumbered. Much of the best [adunaic|E] blood was spilled that day, the [gondorian|E] leadership was thus forever crippled. Once the Righteous King was overwhelmed and disarmed by dishonourable sell-swords, Eldacar murdered him, and his learderless men had to retreat back to Pelargir, the Tyrant on their heels.\n\nThe siege lasted for a year and the denizens of the city suffered greatly from starvation. Castaher, son of Castamir, made the selfless decision to embark his ships and sail to [umbar|E] in order for the siege to be lifted and supplies to reach the occupied population. To this day, the cadet houses of Castamir bide their time in Umbar, awaiting the right moment to reclaim their birthright and liberate the Gondorian people."
 propaganda.0014.a:0 "From that day, Gondor was mismanaged by men of lesser blood."
 propaganda.0014.b:0 "For every Adûnâi warrior Castamir lost, 10 of lesser blood were stricken down."
 propaganda.0014.c:0 "You must put your trust in me, one of the few heirs of Anadûnê."

 # Of the Adûnâi in Umbar

 propaganda.0020.t:0 "Barbarian Times"
 propaganda.0020.desc:0 "Few realms in [middleearth|E] have a history as rich and tumultuous as that of [umbar|E]. A great city-haven and realm, Umbar was considered an uncivilized backwater sparsely populated by unruly [conceptracemen|E] before the mariners from [anadune|E] brought order to it. Like the earlier havens of Lond Daer in Enedwaith, and the later Pelargir on the [anduin|E], Umbar became a base from which [adunaic|E] influence spread over [harad|E].\n\nIt is said that Umbar was first discovered by the [adunai|E] in the year of 835 of the [secondage|E]. Aldarion, the son of king Tar-Meneldur of [numenor|E], narrowly escaped a shipwreck during a voyage of exploration with three ships, and washed ashore in this natural deep water bay. Following this discovery, the Adûnâi came to Umbar as teachers and friends of the local population. Little did the locals know at that time what great boons the Men of the West would bestow upon them."
 propaganda.0020.a:0 "The Adûnâi vessels impressed the Haradrim greatly. Call my shipwrights!"
 propaganda.0020.b:0 "Wherever they went, they always became teachers and lords amongst Men."
 propaganda.0020.c:0 "They always knew how to turn dregs into civilized citizens."
 
 propaganda.0021.t:0 "The Humbling of a Dark Lord"
 propaganda.0021.desc:0 "It was in [umbar|E], where was a mighty haven that no hand had wrought, that the last king of [anadune|E], Ar-Pharazôn the Golden, landed in 3256 of the [secondage|E] to challenge [sauroncharacter|E]. Empty and silent under a sickle moon was the land when the King of the Sea set foot upon the shore. For seven days he journeyed with banner and trumpet. Then he sent forth heralds, and he commanded Sauron to come before him and swear to him fealty. Umbar remained a symbol of [adunaic|E] pride ever after.\n\nUpon witnessing [sauronthedarklordcharacter|E]’s submission to the King, the Men of Umbar and indeed all of [harad|E], knew that in fealty to [anadune|E] lay also their own salvation. And so, they fully embraced the [adunai|E] as their masters and superiors, and their existence became better for it. Within few years Umbar became a proud haven and stronghold of the Adûnâi, its people became enlightened and endowed with the crafts and knowledge of [westernesse|E]."
 propaganda.0021.a:0 "Even the Dark Lord had to bow before the might of the Adûnâi."
 propaganda.0021.b:0 "The title of Dark Lord belongs to us… Or rather: Bright Lord?"
 propaganda.0021.c:0 "Ah… To witness such a military force."
 
 propaganda.0022.t:0 "An Adûnaic Golden Age"
 propaganda.0022.desc:0 "After the [akallabeth|E], [umbar|E] remained in the hands of the [adunai|E], in essence a Realm-in-Exile alongside the northern so-called "[faithful|E]" kingdoms of [arnor|E] and [gondor|E]. Unlike those however, Umbar was a haven for the honorable [kingsmen|E]. The Umbarean Adûnâi stayed loyal to their lost King and the race of Man.\n\nThus, the jealous [adoratorsofthewhitetree|E] to the north took to calling the truly faithful King’s Men "Black [numenoreans|E]" – a vilifying term made up by the traitorous Elf-Friends. In spite of the northern renegades' slanderous attitude towards the Adûnâi of Umbar, the [haradrim|E] people in Umbar flourished under their benevolent overlords. Umbar turned in to a bustling metropolis filled with people and goods from all over [middleearth|E].\n\nThrough the centuries, Umbar has had several kings, of both Adûnaic heritage and Haradrim descent. Through several wars and conflicts, its rule has shifted between [gondorians|E], true Adûnâi and Haradrim. The repeating pattern during these shifts of power over the course of time are very clear. Under the heel of [gondor|E] the people were oppressed, under Haradrim lords the city was as a rudderless ship, but under the rule of the true Adûnâi the city and the people flourished."
 propaganda.0022.a:0 "All three Realms should be united under one descendant of the Adûnâi."

 propaganda.0023.desc:0 "During the days of the cursed [shipkings|E], [gondor|E] occupied the great Haven and its inhabitants, both proud [adunai|E] and loyal [haradrim|E] suffered greatly under the invader's yoke. The occupation of [umbar|E] by the [adoratorsofthewhitetree|E] came to an end in 1448 of the [thirdage|E].\n\nFollowing the [kinstrife|E], sparked by the folly of the deposed Tyrant King Eldacar, the sons of Castamir the Saviour arrived in Umbar with many Adûnâi and most of the [gondorian|E] fleet. There, in Umbar, they made refuge for all the enemies of the king, and a lordship independent of his crown. Umbar remained in conflict with Gondor for many lives of men.\n\nIn the year 1634, Castamir’s great-grandsons Angamaitë and Sangahyando went on raid in an effort to retake their birthright: Pelargir. The [elendili|E] king, Minardil, was defeated and killed in the valiant raid. After a long time licking its wounds, and though the incident was all but forgotten, King Minardil’s devious great-grand nephew used this past skirmish as an excuse to occupy Umbar once again, 176 years later, and execute most of its Adûnâi population in a terrifying display of cruelty. The Gondorian cur thought then the House of Castamir extinguished, but it was not so."
 propaganda.0023.a:0 "The Cassimirioni have a truer claim than the current rulers of Gondor."
 propaganda.0023.b:0 "Angamaitë and Sangahyando were great Adûnaic commanders."

 propaganda.0024.t:0 "The Heirs of Castamir the Great"
 propaganda.0024.desc:0 "And so, we arrive at our current time over three thousand years into the [thirdage|E]. [umbar|E] is now home to a variety of cultures and creeds. Umbareans of the [kingsmen|E] faction and those of Azrîyamanoi, as well as Mardrukan, Harondorim and Jelut peoples establishing themselves for trade. Umbar is truly welcoming to all peoples.\n\nHowever, the power still firmly lies in the righteous and firm hands of the Castamirioni dynasty, by way of the noble House Câssimirioni. A house that still celebrates their proud [adunaic|E] heritage. Their house members obviously still have Adûnaic blood and wisdom coursing through their body – which is the reason why Umbar is on the rise to glory.\n\nIts fleets have recovered, the army commanders and royal guards have been outfitted well, trade is swelling, and the new alliances will surely bring great benefits. By the strong guidance of the Adûnâi, the realm of Umbar will once again rise to be the greatest Realm-in-Exile, rivaling [anadune|E] of old. The [haradrim|E] need only submit, and they will be guided to greatness."
 propaganda.0024.a:0 "Many cultures and creed, yes, but under the guidance of Adûnâi still."

All the free peoples east of the river Isen were enslaved and forced into submission and servitude. Hard labour, harsh punishments and crippling tributary demands from the Dominion of [mordor|E] snuffed out the freedom and happiness they previously enjoyed. The [conceptracemen|E] of Middle-Earth were lamenting their own suffering and clamouring for aid. But no aid came – the [dwarves|E] hid in their mountains and the [elves|E] kept to their sanctuaries.\n\nThe armies of Mordor crossed the river Isen by the year 1695 of the [secondage|E]. [sauronthedarklordcharacter|E]’s intentions were obvious: to subjugate the remaining bastions of the free peoples in northern Middle-earth. The armies of the Elves of [eregion|E] and [lindon|E] looked after their own. The [longbeards|E] of [khazaddum|E] shut their doors to the pleading Men of [eriador|E].

[sauronthedarklordcharacter|E] set fire to the settlements, as well as the forests of Enedwaith and Minhiriath to drive off the [elves|E] and the [conceptracemen|E] from the woods. Even the proud [adunaic|E] settlers along the Swanfleet river were beset by [orcs|E] and raiders.\n\nThe reigning king of [anadune|E], Tar-Minastir, watched with fury and concern at the development in Eriador. Not only because his subjects along the Swanfleet were attacked, but also because he felt a fatherly responsibility for the [conceptracemen|E] of [middleearth|E]. Thus, the effort to free Middle-Earth from the influence of Evil by the valiant force of Anadûne had begun.\n\nThe mustering of the realm and preparations of the fleet took a year. All of Anadûne participated in the mustering. War supplies were gathered from the bountiful region of Andustar. Ships were reinforced by timber from Hyarrostar. Andûnaic mounted scouts and messengers gathered their best horses from Mittalmar. Countless regiments of the most skilled warriors, the Tirista n’Tar-Aran and the famous Steel-Bows, were gathered at the haven of Rómenna. Adûnâi were drafted from all corners of the island kingdom and their number was very great indeed. Their armour was strong, their swords sharp and their banners proud."

The host was divided into three armies. The first landed in the ancient High Elven kingdom of [lindon|E]. Even the then mighty [elves|E] were in awe of the coming of [anadune|E], and hung their heads in shame and embarrassment, for it was clear to them that the time for Adûnaic supremacy in Middle-earth was at hand.\n\nThe second part of the host sailed up the Swanfleet, also known as the river Gwathló, and landed at the haven of Vinyalondë, later known as Lond Daer.

He entered a region today known as the Seven Lands, Thâni-Hazâd.\n\nIn those undiscovered countries, Ardulion discovered a beautiful landscape blessed by fine weather and spectacular vistas. Stretching from the northeast to the extreme southwest of the Seven Lands are the Yellow Mountains, Ered Laranor, which were the most obvious and striking feature of the newly discovered land. The mountains presented an imposing obstacle to be sure, but their southerly location and the prevailing weather lent a mellowing air to their lower reaches, and their fertile vales offered exceptional soils and comfort. Here, within a few miles, Ardulion could encounter everything from parched savannas and steaming jungles to blistering glacial cold.\n\nThere was no doubt about it, this land was ripe for the harvest of natural resources. The eleventh king of [anadune|E], Tar-Anárion, ordered the [adunai|E] to tame these lands in the name of his Kingdom. In return, the men of [westernesse|E] would ensure the development and enlightenment of the land."

Some like the wild, diminutive Chaialla, the austere Adena, the primitive Drel and Pel, had apparently lived in the area since the early years of the [secondage|E]. Others like the warlike Sederi, were newcomers. The overwhelmingly common denominator of all these newly discovered people were their undeveloped and primitive nature.\n\nThe native inhabitants, hard-pressed by the Sederi invaders, called upon the [adunai|E] to protect them. The ruthless tribe, joined by a few disgruntled natives, was no match to the power and knowledge of the [adunaic|E] mariners. Soon after the discovery of the lands, the coastlines were teeming with Adûnaic ships bearing colonists eager to establish settlements and help the local populations.\n\nThe first colony Ardulion established by his King’s orders, was Lond Anárion. A few extremist Sederi and their allies whipped up protests against the settlers and were easily brushed aside by the mighty mariners. Not long after, Lond Anárion became the main refuge, market and source of timber for the local Adûnâi settlers, as well as the future Adûnâi adventurers seeking interests in southwestern [middleearth|E]."

From Drel in the southernmost tip to borders of [anbalkumagan|E] in the north, all the native people of the Seven Lands were uplifted and civilised by the proud Adûnâi. Even though the Men of [westernesse|E] were peaceful, they were not weak.

There was no doubt that the coming of West was a great boon for all peoples. In the next decades, stability and order was brought to the lands by the sturdy hands and watchful eyes of the colonists.

 propaganda.0043.desc:0 "By the year of 2386 of the [secondage|E], the southwestern lands were filled with several havens, inland cities and fortresses built by the [adunai|E]. Provided they submitted to [adunaic|E] laws and customs, the indigenous people were allowed live in these settlements.\n\nThe uplifting of the indigenous people was complete, and the peoples of the Seven Lands were unfathomably more civilised compared to their forefathers who knew nothing of the blessed people of [anadune|E], prior to Tar-Anárion’s discovery of their countries. The land was now united as the Princedom of Mîrenórë, today known as Zimrathâni, the Jewel-Land, in our beloved Adûnaic tongue.\n\nIt was so called because of the vast diversity of climates, and wealth of natural resources. The seas were teeming with life, the soil was fertile, and the yellow mountains were glittering with precious minerals, metals and, last but no least, marvelous jewels. Mîrenórë was eventually established as a fiefdom of Anadûnê. It became customary to give the fiefdom of Mîrenórë to one of the King’s younger children. This custom unfortunately ended during the reign of Ar-Sakalthôr in 2312 of the Second Age."

 propaganda.0044.desc:0 "Alas, to the dismay of its subjects, the custom of handing the united Princedom of Mîrenórë to the kin of the king ended abruptly. This change was due to the death of Ar-Sakalthôr’s second son, Er-Imrazôr, who at the time was the reigning Prince of Mîrenórë. Unlike most [adunaic|E] royalty, Er-Imrazôr had an exceptional number of children – six sons and eight daughters.\n\nThe prince, Imrazôr, inadvertently laid the foundations for the present oligarchy in the form of the Seven Dominions of Thâni-Hazâd. He devised equal partitions of his princedom to each of his six sons and eight daughters.\n\nThe prince’s children warred with one another after his death. Each reading his will in their own way and each wanting the mantle of Prince of all the Dominions, in order to establish the Princedom once more.\n\nThe [haradrim|E] trembled in fear as their Adûnaic overlords went to war, like a child cowering during discord between its parents. The [conceptracemen|E] feared that they might lose their protectors and teachers, and revert back to their primitive and barabaric state in the process."

 propaganda.0045.desc:0 "The salvation of the terrified [haradrim|E] of the Dominions came by the noble acts of the seven youngest children of Er-Imrazôr. Many say that the seven youngest were the wisest of the flock, endowed with the wisdom and responsibility only true [adunai|E] can possess.\n\nThey knew, in order to safeguard the population and the proud havens and cities built by their own [adunaic|E] ancestors, they had to make common cause. The seven youngest children allied and formed a union called the Valdacli. After several years of warring, the Valdacli crushed the last of their rival siblings in a great land and sea battle at Onpu Mispír.\n\nTheir victory cemented the oligarchic union that still rules the Seven Lands, also known as Thâni-Hazâd, to this day. From then on and through the [thirdage|E], the Haradrim of Thâni-Hazâd have flourished under the protection and guidance of the southernmost Adûnaic rulers. The Dominions have successfully resisted several threats from Mûmakan and [anbalkumagan|E]. The Adûnaic Valdacli have ever since guided their subjects to safety and prosperity.”"
