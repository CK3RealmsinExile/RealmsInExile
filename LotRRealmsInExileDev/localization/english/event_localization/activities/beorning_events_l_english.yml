 beorning.0001.t:0 "The Honey Incident"
 beorning.0001.desc:0 "I wake up to the sound of a familiar voice, someone trying to burst into the room in an agitated state.\n\n“My liege! We have been raided in the night! The hives have been torn apart! There is honeycomb scattered across the courtyard! The bees are in a frenzy! We must...”"
 beorning.0001.a:0 "Open the door"
 beorning.0001.b:0 "Continue sleeping"

 beorning.0002.t:0 "The Honey Incident"
 beorning.0002.desc:0 "I let [advisor.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] in. After a few seconds of breathless ranting [advisor.GetSheHe] suddenly stops speaking and stares at me, mouth agape. I follow [advisor.GetHerHis] gaze down to my body. I realise that it is matted with honey and crushed bees, along with a score of angry welts where I have been stung. As I bite my lower lip in consternation, I realise that it, too, is coated in sweet unctuousness.\n\nI glance back up at [advisor.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], who is already backing out of the room, stuttering apologies."
 beorning.0002.a:0 "Well, this is embarrassing..."

 beorning.0003.t:0 "The Honey Incident"
 beorning.0003.desc:0 "Gradually the realisation dawns on me that this is one of those times where my primal urges took control while I was in bestial form. Before I see or talk to anybody else, I first need to figure out the mess I have left behind."
 beorning.0003.a:0 "I need to clean up this mess first"
 beorning.0003.toast.a.success:0 "Trait received!"

 beorning.0011.t:0 "A Mountain Raid"
 beorning.0011.desc:0 "I smell them first. Drifting down from the foothills, a stench of filth and old blood. I follow the scent, feeling the anger - and hunger - grow within me. Soon I can hear them too, harsh cackles and shouts, and the clattering of iron and steel.\n\nThe clouds part as I lumber to the edge of a clearing, illuminating the scene. I see them now, gathered around a crackling fire - a score of mountain goblins, arguing in their guttural tongue. Are they hunting for wild beasts, or preparing to raid the settlements down below?"
 beorning.0011.a:0 "Attempt to slay all the goblins"
 beorning.0011.a.success:0 "You destroy the party of goblins"
 beorning.0011.a.failure:0 "You are wounded during the attack"
 beorning.0011.toast.a.failure:0 "Wounded"
 beorning.0011.b:0 "Attempt to drive the goblins off"
 beorning.0011.b.success:0 "You drive the goblins back to the mountains"
 beorning.0011.b.failure:0 "You are wounded during the attack"
 beorning.0011.toast.b.failure:0 "Wounded"
 beorning.0011.c:0 "Target the goblin chief"

 beorning.0011.toast.c.failure:0 "Wounded"
 beorning.0011.d:0 "Retreat!"

 beorning.0012.t:0 "A Mountain Raid"
 beorning.0012.desc:0 "They do not expect to encounter an enemy this close to the mountains. I am in amongst them before they know it. I revel in my bestial strength, crushing each foe in turn with paw and jaw. Some try to flee. I pursue them. They die."
 beorning.0012.a:0 "Rawwww!"

 beorning.0013.t:0 "A Mountain Raid"
 beorning.0013.desc:0 "They do not expect to encounter an enemy this close to the mountains. I am in amongst them before they know it. I revel in my bestial strength with paw and jaw. The goblin party flees in panic."
 beorning.0013.a:0 "Rawwww!"

 beorning.0014.t:0 "A Mountain Raid"
 beorning.0014.desc:0 "When all is done I lumber back down into the valley, the head of the largest orc still between my jaws. On the morrow it will be found on a spike before set before my hall - as a trophy, and as a warning."
 beorning.0014.a:0 "Rawwww!"

 beorning.0021.t:0 "A Lost Homeland"
 beorning.0021.desc:0 "Something drew me here, as it often does. An irresistible call. Slowly I lumber up the hillsides, over the foothills, up into the high valleys. I pass many beasts along my path, but they do not flee: they sense my mood.\n\nFinally I ascend a crag, and sit looking out over the valley below. I was born and raised in the lowlands, but here, in the mountains, is my true home. The home of my ancestors. I know it in my blood. I stare up at the moon, which seems to stare back at me. It has witnessed all the history of my people. Perhaps one day it will see them fulfill their destiny. To drive out our foes, and return to our mountain homes."
 beorning.0021.a:0 "Am I worthy of my ancestors?"
 beorning.0021.a.success:0 "They would be proud of me"
 beorning.0021.a.failure:0 "I'm just a shadow of my dynasty"
 beorning.0021.toast.a.success:0 "Major dynasty prestige obtained!"
 beorning.0021.toast.a.failure:0 "Minor dynasty prestige obtained!"

 beorning.0022.t:0 "A Lost Homeland"
 beorning.0022.desc:0 "In the distance I see the first ochre hints of dawn. It is time to return to the valley below. I tear myself from my reverie and bound back down the slope. But I know I will return to this place, as surely as the rising of the sun. One day… perhaps… for good."
 beorning.0022.a:0 "Return home"

 beorning.0031.t:0 "The Carrock"
 beorning.0031.desc:0 "Through the long evening I have paced the bounds of my lands. In my bestial form I can cover great distances in a single night, and this one has been no exception. Still, there is one last place that I wish to visit before returning to my halls, and to my mannish form.\n\nI wade across the ford, taking the opportunity to sweep an unfortunate fish into my jaws. I reach the great eyot in the centre of the river, and bound up the steep steps. Once I emerge at the summit I take a moment to survey the surroundings. \n\nTo the east lies the Great Forest, the moonlight illuminating a glittering blanket of fog that clings to the trees. To the north and south, the great river of Wilderland, taking its serpentine path through the vale on its way to lands of which I have heard only rumour. To the west, the Mountains of Mist, upthrust shards silhouetted in the crisp moonlight.\n\nI know that so long as I patrol these lands my enemies will be deterred, and my people will sleep safer at night."
 beorning.0031.a:0 "Look to the East (The Great Forest)"
 beorning.0031.b:0 "Turn to the West (The Misty Mountains)"

 beorning.0041.t:0 "An Unexpected Arrow"
 beorning.0041.desc:0 "Being able to change into the form of an enormous bear has advantages… and disadvantages.\n\nA key advantage is that I am able to patrol my lands in the form of a gigantic animal of immense strength. That usually proves to be an excellent deterrence. If I do encounter an actual enemy - be that [orc|E], warg or black-hearted man - I have a very good chance of being able to crush them to a pulp with my bestial strength.\n\nA key disadvantage is that sometimes my own people mistake me for, well, a bear. Yes they know the rumours, and know not to speak of them in polite company. Yes they know that my only interest is in protecting them. However, my lands also contain real bears, and sometimes those bears raid crops, hives, and sometimes even halls. I therefore make a habit of avoiding villages, as sometimes their inhabitants quite understandably get the wrong end of the stick. Tonight I encountered a shepherd guarding his flock."
 beorning.0041.a:0 "Stand your ground"
 beorning.0041.a.success:0 "Life teachs you a lesson"
 beorning.0041.a.failure:0 "You are wounded by an arrow"
 beorning.0041.toast.a.success:0 "A mighty, wounded bear"
 beorning.0041.toast.a.failure:0 "A wounded bear"
 beorning.0041.b:0 "Beat a hasty retreat"

 beorning.0042.t:0 "An Unexpected Arrow"
 beorning.0042.desc:0 "In my bear form my judgement is often clouded, leading to unfortunate consequences. This time is no exception.\n\nThe shepherd cries out in terror and turns to flee. But suddenly they find their courage, and turn to face me, bow in hand. In the blink of an eye I feel a sharp pain, as an arrow strikes deep into my haunch.\n\nIt’ll really hurt in the morning, and I know the wound will be difficult to explain to my physician..."
 beorning.0042.a:0 "Ouch."

 beorning.0043.t:0 "An Unexpected Arrow"
 beorning.0043.desc:0 "As I beat a hasty retreat, I can hear the mocking laughter of the shepherd: "Ha! Bears aren't aren't that scary after all...""
 beorning.0043.a:0 "Make a mental note to increase that shepherd's taxes"

 beorning.9000.t:0 "Return to Home and Hearth"
 beorning.9000.desc:0 "I restore my human form, yet I know the beast still lurks within..."
 beorning.9000.a:0 "Return to your human form"
