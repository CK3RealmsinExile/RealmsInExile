 evil.0023.craft.a.desc:0 "A Morgul-blade... a foul tool, and one difficult to create.

Your time shall come."
 evil.0023.treachery.b.desc:0 "It is a strange thing, to take the form of another. You tower over your normal body, muscled and hulking, furred and imposing, like a Werewolf of the First Age.

 evil.0023.darkness.c.desc:0 "It starts, as it always does, with a minor thing. A member of the court tired, then one passing away silenty in the night - surely nothing major, just a natural occurence. Well, then it happens.
