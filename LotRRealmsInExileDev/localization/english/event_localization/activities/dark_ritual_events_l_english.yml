 #Preparing reagents
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0001.t: "Ritual Preparations"
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0001.desc.intro: "The chamber reeks of burnt bone and old blood, the air thick with incense meant to mask worse things. I sort through my reagents—twisted roots, curdled fat, a vial of black ichor that shifts against the glass. Each carries purpose, though I do not name them. Power lies in the unknown, in forces beyond mortal grasp.\n\nI take up the dagger, its edge dulled from use. There are sigils to trace, chants to whisper, but intent is what matters. The air shivers as I murmur the first syllables, testing the dark forces that gather, patient as vultures. Failure is not an option. Failure invites worse than death."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0001.desc.apprentice: "\n\nIf my apprentice has learned, they will watch in silence. The work is not for trembling hands. They will fetch what I demand, or they will suffer the lesson of failure. I will ensure they do not forget it."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0001.a: "Continue the preparations."
 
 #Sacrificing a prisoner
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0002.t: "A Costly Stumble"
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0002.desc.intro: "The prisoner’s fate was sealed, their path leading to the table where their life would end. But then—hesitation, a misstep. A foot catches on something unseen, and in that fleeting moment of failure, the prisoner bolts. Their chains rattle as they flee, desperation fueling their escape."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0002.desc.apprentice: "\n\nMy apprentice curses, scrambling upright, but their error has already cost us. The prisoner is fast, driven by terror, their bare feet slapping against the cold stone. I watch, my decision looming. Do I send my apprentice after them, forcing them to correct their mistake, or do I let the wretch go? A single sacrifice is nothing in the grand design."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0002.desc.no_apprentice: "\n\nMy footing fails me, sending me staggering. It is enough. The prisoner lunges forward, ripping free of my grasp, their breath ragged with hope. I regain my balance, watching as they vanish into the shadows. Do I pursue them, wasting time on what was once assured, or do I simply let them go? Their life is insignificant in the end."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0002.a: "Give chase. They will not escape."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0002.b: "Let them run. I do not need them."
 
 #The Chase's End
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0003.t: "The Chase's End"
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0003.desc.no_apprentice.with_prisoner: "I lunge forward, chains rattling in my grip as I drag the prisoner down. Their body crashes onto the cold stone, breaths coming in sobs. "Futile," I snarl, tightening the shackles. They will learn that escape is never an option."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0003.desc.no_apprentice.without_prisoner: "My pursuit falters as I lose sight of them in the twisting corridors. A bitter realization burns within me: they’ve escaped. But sacrifices are not finite, and my ritual will continue undeterred."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0003.desc.apprentice: "My apprentice returns, breath ragged and robes dust-streaked."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0003.desc.apprentice.with_prisoner: " Their grip on the prisoner's chains is tight, knuckles pale. The wretch stumbles behind them, defeated and bloodied. "It is done," my apprentice gasps, pride flickering beneath exhaustion. I nod, withholding praise. Success is expected, not rewarded."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0003.desc.apprentice.without_prisoner: " My apprentice slinks back alone, their head bowed. "They were too fast," they whisper hoarsely. The cowardice clings to their voice. I grip their arm, voice cutting through their shame like a dagger. "Weakness invites ruin. Do better—or be replaced.""
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0003.a: "Continue with the preparations."
 
 #Unseen Whispering
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0004.t: "A Sound at the Edge"
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0004.desc.intro: "As the ritual takes shape, a whisper drifts through the still air—faint, formless, and without direction. It does not call a name, nor does it demand attention, yet it lingers at the edges of perception. The sound is neither intrusive nor urgent, just there, threading through the silence like a forgotten breath. Whether it is imagined or something more, the preparation must continue."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0004.desc.apprentice: "\n\nMy apprentice shifts uneasily, their hands faltering over the reagents. I see the tension in their posture, the way their gaze flickers to the dark corners of the chamber. They hear it too. But I will not acknowledge it, and neither will they—unless they wish to learn the consequences of hesitation."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0004.a: "Ignore it. The ritual must continue."
 
 #A Lingering Doubt
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0005.t: "A Lingering Doubt"
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0005.desc.intro: "The preparations are nearly complete, each step carried out with care. Yet, a cold certainty settles in—the sense that something is not as it should be. The tools are laid out, the air is thick with the weight of the work to come, but the unease lingers. It is not a failure that can be seen, only felt, a gnawing doubt that tightens like a noose."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0005.desc.apprentice: "\n\nMy apprentice hesitates, their hands hovering over the gathered reagents. They glance at me, uncertain. I say nothing, watching as realization dawns in their widening eyes—something is missing. But I will not name it for them. If they are to be of use, they will correct their own mistakes."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0005.desc.no_apprentice: "\n\nI scan the assembled reagents, my fingers drifting over them one by one. A creeping sense of absence coils in my mind, though I cannot place its source. Something was meant to be here. Something vital. But doubt is a weakness I will not entertain."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0005.a: "Push forward. Doubt is weakness."
 
 #A Distant Cry
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0006.t: "A Call from Afar"
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0006.desc.intro: "As the ritual nears its culmination, a distant cry echoes through the stone halls—a scream or sob, raw with fear and pain. It is hard to tell if it is even of this world, or if it comes from the shadow of the prisoner’s impending fate. The sound drifts, hauntingly close, but the prisoner does not stir. Their fate is sealed, and no distraction will stop the process."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0006.desc.apprentice: "\n\nMy apprentice flinches, their eyes darting toward the source of the sound. They are too soft, too distracted by such noises. I see their hesitation and know that they need to focus, or they will lose control of the situation entirely."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0006.desc.no_apprentice: "\n\nThe cry is nothing but a momentary distraction. I allow it to pass, unheeded. The prisoner before me knows their role; their terror will soon be silenced."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0006.a: "Ignore the cry. The ritual continues."
 
 #End Result
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0100.t.life_extension: "The Gift of Time"
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0100.t.raise_undead_hordes: "The Awakening"
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0100.t.pestilence: "A Whisper of Decay"
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0100.t.blighting_lands: "A Scar Upon the Earth"
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0100.desc.life_extension: "A quiet, unseen shift occurs within me, subtle yet profound. Something stretches, deep within, as if the threads of my existence are subtly rewoven. I feel the weight of years lighten, time itself bending under my influence, though it is hard to say exactly how. I am not the same as I was before; the future feels far, though I cannot see it."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0100.desc.life_extension.apprentice: "\n\nMy apprentice watches with wide eyes, the weight of what has just occurred sinking into their mind. They sense it too, the change in the air, though they do not fully grasp its magnitude."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0100.desc.life_extension.sacrifice: "\n\nThe price of this power lingers in the air, faint yet unmistakable. There is no clear mark, but the sacrifice has been made—life traded for a future that now feels infinite."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0100.desc.raise_undead_hordes: "The price of this power lingers in the air, faint yet unmistakable. There is no clear mark, but the sacrifice has been made—life traded for a future that now feels infinite."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0100.desc.raise_undead_hordes.apprentice: "\n\nI sense their hesitation. They watch, uncertain, feeling the chill of the rising presence but unsure of its scope. I say nothing, but the weight of the moment is heavy."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0100.desc.raise_undead_hordes.sacrifice: "\n\nThe echo of their departure lingers faintly, carried by the figures now standing. It is unclear whether they have joined or merely made way."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0100.desc.pestilence: "A subtle tension fills the air, unseen but undeniable. A slow, spreading feeling begins, seeping into the very fabric of existence. The land or the body shudders imperceptibly, and what once lived begins to fade—though it cannot be seen directly, it can be felt. The air grows thick, foul, as something festers quietly."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0100.desc.pestilence.apprentice: "\n\nMy apprentice shifts, sensing the change but not understanding its full scope. They glance nervously toward me, as though expecting some further explanation, though I offer none."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0100.desc.pestilence.sacrifice: "\n\nThe lingering energy from the sacrifice seems to feed the spread of decay. It is unclear whether the sacrifice has quickened the spreading rot, or if it is merely a quiet echo of what has begun."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0100.desc.blighting_lands: "The land shudders, a quiet loss. There is no visible change, yet something is undeniably different—its essence feels drained, its pulse muted. A shadow spreads beneath the surface, unmarked but tangible, leaving behind an echo of what once was. The change is not seen but felt, as though life has withdrawn from the soil itself."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0100.desc.blighting_lands.apprentice: "\n\nMy apprentice stands still, uncertain, sensing something is wrong but not fully comprehending what has happened. They do not yet understand how deep this mark runs."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0100.desc.blighting_lands.sacrifice: "\n\nThe land bears a faint, lingering echo of the sacrifice, though no physical sign is visible. Its pulse is different now—thinner, as if the earth itself remembers what was taken."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0100.desc.no_apprentice: "\n\nThe cry is nothing but a momentary distraction. I allow it to pass, unheeded. The prisoner before me knows their role; their terror will soon be silenced."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0100.a.life_extension: "Proceed, unmarked by the passing years."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0100.a.raise_undead_hordes: "Let the dead rise in their place."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0100.a.pestilence: "Let the rot take root."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0100.a.blighting_lands: "Allow the land to wither."

 #Aiding in a Task
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0200.t: "Silent Observation"
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0200.desc: "The chamber is dimly lit, the air thick with the weight of unspoken knowledge. My master works with steady, practiced motions, giving no explanation, only expectation. I move where I must, hands following silent instruction. Every movement holds meaning, though I am left to decipher it on my own. A single mistake could unravel the process, but if I watch carefully, I may learn more than I am meant to."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0200.a: "Follow the task exactly as instructed."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0200.b: "Attempt to understand the purpose behind the task."

 #Reading What Was Forgotten
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0201.t: "Held for Later"
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0201.desc: "The shelves are heavy with dust and age, their contents older still. I was sent to retrieve a specific tome, yet my fingers brush across another—its binding worn, its presence nearly forgotten. Something about it lingers in my thoughts. My master does not watch me here. It would be easy to slip it away, but if I am caught, there will be consequences."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0201.a: "Ignore the temptation and retrieve only what was asked."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0201.b: "Take the hidden tome for later study."

 #Taking the First Step
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0202.t: "The Threshold Crossed"
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0202.desc: "The moment has come. My master does not speak, does not demand, only watches. The choice is mine alone, yet I know what is expected. A simple act, a word, or something irreversible—each path leads forward, yet some roads will change me more than others."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0202.a: "Hesitate and choose the least drastic action."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0202.b: "Embrace what must be done without flinching."

 #A Lesson in Pain
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0203.t: "Endurance"
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0203.desc: "The sting is sharp at first, then dulls into a steady ache. I was not told to resist, nor was I told to surrender. This is a test—of my will, of my commitment. I can endure it as I am, or I can lean into the pain, prove that I do not fear it, and perhaps be rewarded for my resolve."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0203.a: "Endure in silence, showing discipline."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0203.b: "Embrace the pain, proving devotion."

 #A Scar Earned
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0204.t: "Unforeseen Consequence"
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0204.desc: "The mixture was prepared exactly as instructed, yet something feels wrong. A warmth spreads across my skin, followed by a sharp sting. I pull my sleeve back—my flesh is marked, raw and tinged with something I cannot name. I could leave it, let it fade, or I could examine it further, see if it holds meaning beyond pain."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0204.a: "Ignore the wound and continue working."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0204.b: "Study the mark, risking further consequences."

 #A Warning Unheeded
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0205.t: "Should Not Have Stayed"
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0205.desc: "The door was left open just enough for me to see. I should have left when told, but curiosity held me still. Now, the air shifts, pressing heavy against my chest. A sound—low, indistinct—echoes through the chamber, though nothing moves. My master does not acknowledge me, too focused on something unseen. I do not think I was meant to witness this, but perhaps I can learn from it—if I dare."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0205.a: "Leave before I am noticed."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0205.b: "Stay and observe, risking discovery."

 #A Desperate Gamble
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0206.t: "Risk and Reward"
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0206.desc: "My master’s attention is elsewhere, their focus too deep to notice my hesitation. An opportunity presents itself—not one given, but one that exists only if I am willing to take it. A question left unspoken, a boundary untested, a step beyond what I have been permitted. If I act, I may gain something invaluable, but if I am caught, the consequences will be severe."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0206.a: "Resist the temptation and step away."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0206.b: "Seize the opportunity, no matter the risk."
 
 #A Bitter Taste
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0207.t: "Swallowed Without Thought"
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0207.desc: "The liquid burns as it slides down my throat, thick and acrid. I was given no warning, only the expectation that I would drink. My stomach churns, my vision blurs—or sharpens—I cannot tell. My master watches, waiting. I could fight through the discomfort, let it pass naturally, or I could focus on it, try to push deeper into whatever effect it has on me."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0207.a: "Wait for the feeling to fade."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0207.b: "Embrace the sensation and see where it leads."
