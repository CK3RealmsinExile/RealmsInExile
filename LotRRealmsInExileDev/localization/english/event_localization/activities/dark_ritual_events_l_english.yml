 evil.0023.powerspell.a.desc:0 "The earth crackles and breaks beneath your words, great pits hollowed out from which foul armaments and troops will soon gush forth. Your levees have increased, and with nary a cost to yourself!"
 evil.0023.powerspell.b.desc:0 "You have undertaken the most profane and sinful of acts. On a dark alter, you have strapped down your courtier, and slowly you begin to chant, until it is a howl that shakes the room. \n\nThen - they shudder, and fall, and you feel a heady, rich sensation, like you have drank of the finest of wines.

 evil.0023.powerspell.c.desc:0 "With black words of darkess malice, you see in your mind the fortifications of your foe.

 evil.0023.craft.a.desc:0 "A Morgul-blade... a foul tool, and one difficult to create. Dark runes upon it, it is brutally cold to the touch, and it inspires dread and wariness upon all who gaze upon it. Forged in a crucible of blood and suffering, with a handle wrought of bone, it is a tool with which to break even the most stalwart."

Your time shall come."
 evil.0023.treachery.b.desc:0 "It is a strange thing, to take the form of another. You tower over your normal body, muscled and hulking, furred and imposing, like a Werewolf of the First Age.

 evil.0023.darkness.c.desc:0 "It starts, as it always does, with a minor thing. A member of the court tired, then one passing away silenty in the night - surely nothing major, just a natural occurence. Well, then it happens. All at once, the courts of your foes beging to flail in panic, shutting themselves away in desperation to avoid the curse, nay the plague, which has fallen on them.
