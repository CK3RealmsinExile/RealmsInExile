 #Preparing reagents
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0001.t: "Ritual Preparations"
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0001.desc.intro: "The chamber reeks of burnt bone and old blood, the air thick with incense meant to mask worse things. I sort through my reagents—twisted roots, curdled fat, a vial of black ichor that shifts against the glass. Each carries purpose, though I do not name them. Power lies in the unknown, in forces beyond mortal grasp.\n\nI take up the dagger, its edge dulled from use. There are sigils to trace, chants to whisper, but intent is what matters. The air shivers as I murmur the first syllables, testing the dark forces that gather, patient as vultures. Failure is not an option. Failure invites worse than death."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0001.desc.apprentice: "\n\nIf my apprentice has learned, they will watch in silence. The work is not for trembling hands. They will fetch what I demand, or they will suffer the lesson of failure. I will ensure they do not forget it."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0001.a: "Continue the preparations."
 
 #Sacrificing a prisoner
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0002.t: "A Costly Stumble"
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0002.desc.intro: "The prisoner’s fate was sealed, their path leading to the table where their life would end. But then—hesitation, a misstep. A foot catches on something unseen, and in that fleeting moment of failure, the prisoner bolts. Their chains rattle as they flee, desperation fueling their escape."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0002.desc.apprentice: "\n\nMy apprentice curses, scrambling upright, but their error has already cost us. The prisoner is fast, driven by terror, their bare feet slapping against the cold stone. I watch, my decision looming. Do I send my apprentice after them, forcing them to correct their mistake, or do I let the wretch go? A single sacrifice is nothing in the grand design."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0002.desc.no_apprentice: "\n\nMy footing fails me, sending me staggering. It is enough. The prisoner lunges forward, ripping free of my grasp, their breath ragged with hope. I regain my balance, watching as they vanish into the shadows. Do I pursue them, wasting time on what was once assured, or do I simply let them go? Their life is insignificant in the end."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0002.a: "Give chase. They will not escape."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0002.b: "Let them run. I do not need them."
 
 #The Chase's End
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0003.t: "The Chase's End"
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0003.desc.no_apprentice.with_prisoner: "I lunge forward, chains rattling in my grip as I drag the prisoner down. Their body crashes onto the cold stone, breaths coming in sobs. "Futile," I snarl, tightening the shackles. They will learn that escape is never an option."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0003.desc.no_apprentice.without_prisoner: "My pursuit falters as I lose sight of them in the twisting corridors. A bitter realization burns within me: they’ve escaped. But sacrifices are not finite, and my ritual will continue undeterred."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0003.desc.apprentice: "My apprentice returns, breath ragged and robes dust-streaked."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0003.desc.apprentice.with_prisoner: " Their grip on the prisoner's chains is tight, knuckles pale. The wretch stumbles behind them, defeated and bloodied. "It is done," my apprentice gasps, pride flickering beneath exhaustion. I nod, withholding praise. Success is expected, not rewarded."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0003.desc.apprentice.without_prisoner: " My apprentice slinks back alone, their head bowed. "They were too fast," they whisper hoarsely. The cowardice clings to their voice. I grip their arm, voice cutting through their shame like a dagger. "Weakness invites ruin. Do better—or be replaced.""
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0003.a: "Continue with the preparations."
 
 #Unseen Whispering
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0004.t: "A Sound at the Edge"
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0004.desc.intro: "As the ritual takes shape, a whisper drifts through the still air—faint, formless, and without direction. It does not call a name, nor does it demand attention, yet it lingers at the edges of perception. The sound is neither intrusive nor urgent, just there, threading through the silence like a forgotten breath. Whether it is imagined or something more, the preparation must continue."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0004.desc.apprentice: "\n\nMy apprentice, [sacrifice.GetNameNoTooltipRegnal], shifts uneasily, their hands faltering over the reagents. I see the tension in their posture, the way their gaze flickers to the dark corners of the chamber. They hear it too. But I will not acknowledge it, and neither will they—unless they wish to learn the consequences of hesitation."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0004.a: "Ignore it. The ritual must continue."
 
 #A Lingering Doubt
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0005.t: "A Lingering Doubt"
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0005.desc.intro: "The preparations are nearly complete, each step carried out with care. Yet, a cold certainty settles in—the sense that something is not as it should be. The tools are laid out, the air is thick with the weight of the work to come, but the unease lingers. It is not a failure that can be seen, only felt, a gnawing doubt that tightens like a noose."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0005.desc.apprentice: "\n\nMy apprentice hesitates, their hands hovering over the gathered reagents. They glance at me, uncertain. I say nothing, watching as realization dawns in their widening eyes—something is missing. But I will not name it for them. If they are to be of use, they will correct their own mistakes."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0005.desc.no_apprentice: "\n\nI scan the assembled reagents, my fingers drifting over them one by one. A creeping sense of absence coils in my mind, though I cannot place its source. Something was meant to be here. Something vital. But doubt is a weakness I will not entertain."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0005.a: "Push forward. Doubt is weakness."
 
 #A Distant Cry
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0006.t: "A Call from Afar"
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0006.desc.intro: "As the ritual nears its culmination, a distant cry echoes through the stone halls—a scream or sob, raw with fear and pain. It is hard to tell if it is even of this world, or if it comes from the shadow of the prisoner’s impending fate. The sound drifts, hauntingly close, but the prisoner does not stir. Their fate is sealed, and no distraction will stop the process."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0006.desc.apprentice: "\n\nMy apprentice flinches, their eyes darting toward the source of the sound. They are too soft, too distracted by such noises. I see their hesitation and know that they need to focus, or they will lose control of the situation entirely."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0006.desc.no_apprentice: "\n\nThe cry is nothing but a momentary distraction. I allow it to pass, unheeded. The prisoner before me knows their role; their terror will soon be silenced."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0006.a: "Ignore the cry. The ritual continues."

 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0007.t: "The Final Lesson"
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0007.desc: "The moment has come. My apprentice kneels before me, unaware or unwilling to believe the truth of their place in my designs. The chamber is silent, save for the steady drip of melted wax and the slow churn of unseen forces gathering at my command. A single strike, a precise moment, and their life will be given to something far greater than themselves. Yet, hesitation—no, defiance—lingers in their eyes. If they sense what is coming, they may resist. The blade must fall before they rise."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0007.a: "Strike, sealing their fate… if they do not fight back."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0007.a.tt: "Start a Duel with your apprentice"
 
 #End Result
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0100.t.life_extension: "The Gift of Time"
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0100.t.raise_undead_hordes: "The Awakening"
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0100.t.pestilence: "A Whisper of Decay"
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0100.t.blighting_lands: "A Scar Upon the Earth"
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0100.desc.life_extension: "A quiet, unseen shift occurs within me, subtle yet profound. Something stretches, deep within, as if the threads of my existence are subtly rewoven. I feel the weight of years lighten, time itself bending under my influence, though it is hard to say exactly how. I am not the same as I was before; the future feels far, though I cannot see it."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0100.desc.life_extension.apprentice: "\n\nMy apprentice watches with wide eyes, the weight of what has just occurred sinking into their mind. They sense it too, the change in the air, though they do not fully grasp its magnitude."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0100.desc.life_extension.sacrifice: "\n\nThe price of this power lingers in the air, faint yet unmistakable. There is no clear mark, but the sacrifice has been made—life traded for a future that now feels infinite."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0100.desc.raise_undead_hordes: "The price of this power lingers in the air, faint yet unmistakable. There is no clear mark, but the sacrifice has been made—life traded for a future that now feels infinite."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0100.desc.raise_undead_hordes.apprentice: "\n\nI sense their hesitation. They watch, uncertain, feeling the chill of the rising presence but unsure of its scope. I say nothing, but the weight of the moment is heavy."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0100.desc.raise_undead_hordes.sacrifice: "\n\nThe echo of their departure lingers faintly, carried by the figures now standing. It is unclear whether they have joined or merely made way."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0100.desc.pestilence: "A subtle tension fills the air, unseen but undeniable. A slow, spreading feeling begins, seeping into the very fabric of existence. The land or the body shudders imperceptibly, and what once lived begins to fade—though it cannot be seen directly, it can be felt. The air grows thick, foul, as something festers quietly."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0100.desc.pestilence.apprentice: "\n\nMy apprentice shifts, sensing the change but not understanding its full scope. They glance nervously toward me, as though expecting some further explanation, though I offer none."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0100.desc.pestilence.sacrifice: "\n\nThe lingering energy from the sacrifice seems to feed the spread of decay. It is unclear whether the sacrifice has quickened the spreading rot, or if it is merely a quiet echo of what has begun."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0100.desc.blighting_lands: "The land shudders, a quiet loss. There is no visible change, yet something is undeniably different—its essence feels drained, its pulse muted. A shadow spreads beneath the surface, unmarked but tangible, leaving behind an echo of what once was. The change is not seen but felt, as though life has withdrawn from the soil itself."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0100.desc.blighting_lands.apprentice: "\n\nMy apprentice stands still, uncertain, sensing something is wrong but not fully comprehending what has happened. They do not yet understand how deep this mark runs."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0100.desc.blighting_lands.sacrifice: "\n\nThe land bears a faint, lingering echo of the sacrifice, though no physical sign is visible. Its pulse is different now—thinner, as if the earth itself remembers what was taken."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0100.desc.no_apprentice: "\n\nThe cry is nothing but a momentary distraction. I allow it to pass, unheeded. The prisoner before me knows their role; their terror will soon be silenced."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0100.a.life_extension: "Proceed, unmarked by the passing years."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0100.a.raise_undead_hordes: "Let the dead rise in their place."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0100.a.pestilence: "Let the rot take root."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0100.a.blighting_lands: "Allow the land to wither."

 #Aiding in a Task
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0200.t: "Silent Observation"
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0200.desc: "The chamber is dimly lit, the air thick with the weight of unspoken knowledge. My master works with steady, practiced motions, giving no explanation, only expectation. I move where I must, hands following silent instruction. Every movement holds meaning, though I am left to decipher it on my own. A single mistake could unravel the process, but if I watch carefully, I may learn more than I am meant to."

 #Reading What Was Forgotten
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0201.t: "Held for Later"
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0201.desc: "The shelves are heavy with dust and age, their contents older still. I was sent to retrieve a specific tome, yet my fingers brush across another—its binding worn, its presence nearly forgotten. Something about it lingers in my thoughts. My master does not watch me here. It would be easy to slip it away, but if I am caught, there will be consequences."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0201.a: "Ignore the temptation and retrieve only what was asked."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0201.b: "Take the hidden tome for later study."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0201.b.toast: "You study the tome in your sleeping chambers"

 #Taking the First Step
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0202.t: "The Threshold Crossed"
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0202.desc: "The moment has come. My master does not speak, does not demand, only watches. The choice is mine alone, yet I know what is expected. A simple act, a word, or something irreversible—each path leads forward, yet some roads will change me more than others."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0202.a: "Hesitate and choose the least drastic action."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0202.a.success: "Your action leads to success"

 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0202.b.failure: "You fail to complete your task"

 #A Lesson in Pain
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0203.t: "Endurance"
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0203.desc: "The sting is sharp at first, then dulls into a steady ache. I was not told to resist, nor was I told to surrender. This is a test—of my will, of my commitment. I can endure it as I am, or I can lean into the pain, prove that I do not fear it, and perhaps be rewarded for my resolve."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0203.a: "Endure in silence, showing discipline."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0203.b: "Embrace the pain, proving devotion."

 #A Scar Earned
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0204.t: "Unforeseen Consequence"
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0204.desc: "The mixture was prepared exactly as instructed, yet something feels wrong. A warmth spreads across my skin, followed by a sharp sting. I pull my sleeve back—my flesh is marked, raw and tinged with something I cannot name. I could leave it, let it fade, or I could examine it further, see if it holds meaning beyond pain."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0204.a: "Ignore the wound and continue working."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0204.a.toast: "You manage to glean some information from the reaction"

 #A Warning Unheeded
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0205.t: "Should Not Have Stayed"
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0205.desc: "The door was left open just enough for me to see. I should have left when told, but curiosity held me still. Now, the air shifts, pressing heavy against my chest. A sound—low, indistinct—echoes through the chamber, though nothing moves. My master does not acknowledge me, too focused on something unseen. I do not think I was meant to witness this, but perhaps I can learn from it—if I dare."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0205.a: "Leave before I am noticed."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0205.b: "Stay and observe, risking discovery."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0205.b.toast: "You observe the ritual"

 #A Desperate Gamble
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0206.t: "Risk and Reward"
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0206.desc: "My master’s chambers are empty, save for the glow of candlelight flickering against ancient tomes and locked chests. My task here was simple—fetch what was asked for, touch nothing else—but my eyes linger on something forbidden. Perhaps it is a scroll, half-unfurled, or a vial filled with something I do not recognize. My master would never grant me such things freely. The risk is great, but so is the temptation. If I reach out, I may gain something valuable—or I may be discovered."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0206.a: "Resist the temptation and step away."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0206.b: "Seize the opportunity, no matter the risk."

 #A Bitter Taste
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0207.t: "Swallowed Without Thought"
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0207.desc: "My master offers me a cup, the contents swirling with something thick, dark, and unfamiliar. No explanation is given, only a look that demands obedience. The air is heavy with the scent of aged parchment and burnt herbs, but beneath it, something acrid lingers. My fingers tighten around the cup. I do not know what will happen if I drink—only that it is expected. A test? A lesson? A punishment? The liquid moves sluggishly as I tilt the cup. The choice is mine, but the consequences are unknown."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0207.a: "Wait for the feeling to fade."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0207.a.toast: "Wait for the feeling to fade."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0207.b: "Embrace the sensation and see where it leads."

 #The Struggle
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0208.t: "A Foe Unbroken"
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0208.desc: "The prisoner should be weak, beaten down by fear, but as I move to restrain them, they lash out. Their desperation is wild, a force I did not expect, and suddenly I am on the ground, the weight of their struggle pressing down on me. Their breath is ragged, their strength fueled by terror.\n\nMy master is nearby, watching—or perhaps waiting to see if I am worthy of handling this myself. I could call for aid or I could fight, knowing that failure is not an option."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0208.a: "Break away and call for my master’s aid."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0208.a.toast: "You call for your master’s aid"
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0208.b: "Fight back alone, risking my life to prove my worth."

 #The Ground Shudders
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0210.t: "The Tremor Below"
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0210.desc: "The earth beneath my feet stirs, slow at first, then violently enough to shake the chamber’s foundation. Loose stones crack, dust rains from above. Something is waking—or something is collapsing. If I remain, I may uncover something long buried. If I linger too long, I may be buried alongside it."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0210.a: "Retreat before the structure gives way."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0210.b: "Stay and endure, hoping to claim whatever lies beneath."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0210.b.no_risk: "While wounded, there is no risk of death"
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0210.b.risk: "You fail to escape in time, risking death"

 #The Fire Consumes
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0211.t: "Hungering Flames"
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0211.desc: "The light was meant to guide, but it has turned against me. The flames twist unnaturally, licking hungrily at the walls, at the air itself. Smoke thickens, heat sears my skin. I was not prepared for this, and escape is closing fast. But within the inferno, something shifts—something untouched by the fire, waiting to be taken."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0211.a: "Escape before the flames claim me."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0211.b: "Rush into the blaze, risking everything for what lies within."
 
 #Blood Ties Severed
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0212.t: "The Price of Loyalty"
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0212.desc: "My master speaks, and the world around me narrows to a single, inescapable truth. One of my own blood must die by my hands. Not an enemy, not a distant relative whose loss would mean nothing, but someone known to me. The weight of the task is meant to break whatever remains of sentiment within me, to sever ties that might pull me back from the path ahead. My master watches, expecting compliance, and I know hesitation will not go unpunished. Their fate is mine to decide."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0212.a: "Refuse, knowing my master does not forgive hesitation."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0212.b: "Accept, taking the first step toward something irreversible."
 
 #A Familiar Face
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0213.t: "The End of a Friendship"
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0213.desc: "The order is given, but my hands do not move. The name I am to strike down is not just a name—it is someone I once called a friend. I see them now in my mind’s eye: the long nights spent speaking in hushed voices, the laughter that once felt endless, the moments of trust we shared. My master speaks of power, of shedding weakness. But is it weakness to hesitate? I know where my friend is. I know they will not suspect me. The choice lingers, thick as smoke, impossible to ignore."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0213.a: "Refuse, knowing that friendship may cost me more than just trust."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0213.b: "Accept, ending a life that once meant something to me."
 
 #The Hunter’s Path
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0214.t: "A Shadow in the Night"
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0214.desc: "y master has marked a target—someone who must be taken, unseen and unheard. I am given no reason, only a task. The streets are familiar, yet tonight they feel different. The weight of what I must do presses against me like the cold air, every footstep a potential mistake. My target moves through the city, unaware that each moment brings me closer. My master trusts I will not fail, but doubt lingers. I must decide now: do I strike, or do I let them slip away and face the consequences?"
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0214.a: "Refuse, knowing my master does not forget disobedience."
 lotr_sorcery_ritual.0214.b: "Accept, slipping into the shadows to complete the task."
