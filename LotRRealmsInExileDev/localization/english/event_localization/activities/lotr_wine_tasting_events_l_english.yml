 wine_tasting.0050.t:0 "Vacation Plans"
 wine_tasting.0050.desc:0 "It’s been too long since I’ve had an opportunity to take a break from my busy life. Many people of the privileged and noble classes of Al-Andalus have #italic munyas#! out in the countryside where they can relax and spend time away from the city. I think it’s about time I go to one.\n\nVacationing at a #italic munya#! isn't just for petty pleasures like one would do in the lands of unenlightened infidels. No, no. These are also places of agronomic and botanical experimentation, and where proper, cultured people gather to engage in scholarly discourse.\n\nAnyways, I'll soon partake in a [ROOT.Char.GetInvolvedActivity.GetShortName] in [ROOT.Char.GetTravelPlan.GetData.GetNextDestination.GetProvince.GetName]. There are many fun things to do on these excursions, no matter one's personality and interests!"
 wine_tasting.0050.a:0 "I want to spend some time by myself."
 wine_tasting.0050.a.tooltip:0 "If you go on vacation to your [munya|E] by yourself, you are more likely to lose [stress|E]. If you wish, you might also have the chance to learn about the latest developments in agronomy and botany to improve your realm."
 wine_tasting.0050.b:0 "Let’s go have some fun!"
 wine_tasting.0050.b.tooltip:0 "If you go on vacation to your [munya|E] with a group, you will have better chances to gain [prestige|E] and [piety|E]. You might also improve the [opinions|E] invitees have of you, and the image you exude as a ruler."

 wine_tasting.0060.t:0 "The Vacation Begins"
 wine_tasting.0060.desc:0 "After some preparations, I've finally arrived at my #italic munya#! in the countryside for my excursion. For the next few days, I’ll have the whole manor to myself so I can relax and enjoy life.\n\nOf course, just because I’m by myself doesn’t mean I can’t engage in some productive activities. Those who are wealthy and powerful enough to own these kinds of large villas often sponsor the efforts of local scholars to conduct botanical and agronomic experiments. Therefore, if I want, I could check on how the projects I’m sponsoring are doing. It would be quite a pleasant surprise if I gain some new insights that help me manage my realm or impress others.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe a vacation should just be for pure relaxation."
 wine_tasting.0060.a:0 "What’s the latest from the surrounding farmlands?"
 wine_tasting.0060.a.tooltip:0 "Take this option to potentially gain new insights into managing our realm and agricultural matters."
 wine_tasting.0060.b:0 "I’m curious what my gardeners and botanists are up to."
 wine_tasting.0060.b.tooltip:0 "Take this option to potentially gain new insights into how plants can personally benefit you."
 wine_tasting.0060.c:0 "This is a time to relax and to not do anything stressful."
 wine_tasting.0060.c.tooltip:0 "Take this option to lose much more [stress|E], but be deprived of a chance to gain other bonuses."
 wine_tasting.0061.t:0 "The Vacation Ends"
 wine_tasting.0061.desc:0 "All good things have come to an end. Though I’ve enjoyed my time at my #italic munya#! these past few days, I must return to my duties as the [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] of these lands.\n\nStill, I am glad I got the opportunity to take this break from the stresses of life. Going to the countryside like this always rejuvenates a [ROOT.Char.GetWomanMan]’s spirit, and I look forward to the next opportunity I have to do this."
 wine_tasting.0061.a:0 "I’m sure I’ll be back sooner than later."
 wine_tasting.0062.t:0 "Agriculture at My Munya"
 wine_tasting.0062.desc:0 "Many #italic munyas#! such as my own also double as plantations that produce anything from delicious fruits and vegetables to sugar to raw silk from mulberry tree. Thus, though I am spending a lot of my time at my #italic munya’s#! main manor to relax, I am interested in seeing how things are doing at the rest of my estate.\n\nThe overseers and a few scholars specializing in agronomy, whom I previously hired to provide guidance for these operations, accompany me as I traverse the fields and orchards. Perhaps I should ask them what they’ve recently learned from their work. The information could come in handy when I return from my vacation, and help me in my responsibilities as this region’s [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip]."
 wine_tasting.0062.a:0 "Ask about crop yields and production"
 wine_tasting.0062.a.title:0 "You gain insights about agriculture!"
 wine_tasting.0062.b:0 "Ask about ways to prepare the foodstuffs"
 wine_tasting.0062.b.title:0 "You gain insights about food!"
 wine_tasting.0063.t:0 "Gardening at My Munya"
 wine_tasting.0063.desc:0 "#italic munyas#! in the countryside often have sizable gardens inside or near the manor, mine included. Flowers, shrubs, trees, and other plants - both those native to Iberia as well as exotic ones from faraway lands - are placed in an aesthetically pleasing manner, alongside charming walkways, benches, and water elements such as fountains and ponds.\n\nI like to enjoy my #italic munya#! gardens, but I also want to see what my staff are up to. The gardeners, laborers, and scholars specializing in botany not only maintain my gardens, but sometimes experiment a little learn more about these plants.\n\nI should ask them if they’ve learned anything interesting. The information could come in handy when I return from my vacation, and perhaps help me find ways to impress others or make the best use of my normal palace gardens."
 wine_tasting.0063.a:0 "Ask about new trends for gardens in Iberia"
 wine_tasting.0063.a.title:0 "You gain insights about gardening!"
 wine_tasting.0063.b:0 "Ask about the properties of these plants"
 wine_tasting.0063.b.title:0 "You gain insights about herbs and medicine!"
 wine_tasting.0064.t:0 "Relaxing at My Munya"
 wine_tasting.0064.desc:0 "While there are plenty of interesting things I could be doing at my #italic munya#!, such as discussing how the nearby farmlands are doing with my overseers or investigating the latest experiments my gardeners and botanists are doing, I’m here for one main reason, and that is to relax.\n\nIt’s been pleasant so far, spending the days just doing absolutely nothing - or at least nothing strenuous. I have a few good meals and nap liberally throughout the day, take walks in the garden or ride my horse through the countryside, and maybe engage in a few simple pleasures like reading a scroll."
 wine_tasting.0064.a:0 "Life is good."
 wine_tasting.0064.a.title:0 "You are remarkably well-rested!"
 
 wine_tasting.0070.t:0 "The Vacation Begins"
 wine_tasting.0070.desc:0 "I’m now at my #italic munya#! in the countryside for my excursion with my court. I made sure to arrive early to see everything was ready. When the first guests start to arrive, I graciously welcome them as the host, before showing them inside.\n\nFor the next few days, we’ll enjoy all manner of amusements in this lovely villa. Some hosts want to dazzle their guests with splendid views of the manor and surrounding area. Others of a more cultured disposition might enjoy intellectual discussions - such as on the botanical or agronomic experiments conducted at these #italic munyas#! or poetry recitations. Yet others will simply want to feast and have a good time.\n\nOf course, I have already decided what to do."
 wine_tasting.0070.a:0 "Let’s enjoy the beauty of the gardens and vistas."
 wine_tasting.0070.a.tooltip.1:0 "You will gain [prestige|E] OR [piety|E], and your #italic munyas#! might become well-known for their beauty and aesthetic charm."
 wine_tasting.0070.a.tooltip.2:0 "Introverted, reserved guests may enjoy this activity more, and have a better [opinion|E] of you after the vacation is done."
 wine_tasting.0070.b:0 "Let’s engage in poetry and intellectual discourse."
 wine_tasting.0070.b.tooltip.1:0 "You will gain [piety|E], and your #italic munyas#! might become well-known for attracting learned, eloquent scholars and poets."
 wine_tasting.0070.b.tooltip.2:0 "Intellectual, thoughtful guests may enjoy this activity more, and have a better [opinion|E] of you after the vacation is done."
 wine_tasting.0070.c:0 "Let’s feast and forget about the worries of life!"
 wine_tasting.0070.c.tooltip.1:0 "You will gain [prestige|E], and your #italic munyas#! might become well-known for hosting plenty of lively, fun parties."
 wine_tasting.0070.c.tooltip.2:0 "Extroverted, sociable guests may enjoy this activity more, and have a better [opinion|E] of you after the vacation is done."
 wine_tasting.0071.t:0 "The Vacation Begins"
 wine_tasting.0071.desc:0 "I’ve finally arrived at [host.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] #italic munya#! in the countryside for our excursion. I notice some of the other guests have just arrived as well. The [host.GetWomanMan] [host.GetHerselfHimself] comes out of the main residence to greet us and welcome us inside.\n\nThough many of the region’s aristocrats own these kinds of villas, myself included, it is always interesting to see those belonging to others. Some focus on delighting visitors with views of beautiful gardens, lovely architecture, or awe-inspiring countryside vistas. Others cultivate an air of sophistication by inviting skilled poets to come engage in intellectual and literary pursuits. Yet others prefer to entice learned scholars to stick around to perform botanical or agronomic experiments.\n\nAnyways, once the other guests arrive, who knows what amusements we’ll enjoy in the coming days?"
 wine_tasting.0071.a:0 "I wonder, what will our itinerary be?"
 wine_tasting.0072.t:0 "The Vacation Ends"
 wine_tasting.0072.desc:0 "All good things have come to an end. While the last few days at my #italic munya#! have been quite fun, my guests and I have to return to our daily lives at some point. We had a great final banquet last night, and now, on this fine, beautiful morning, we must depart.\n\nNonetheless, I know we all had a great time, and it was a nice diversion from the stresses of daily life."
 wine_tasting.0072.a:0 "I look forward to the next excursion!"
 wine_tasting.0073.t:0 "The Vacation Ends"
 wine_tasting.0073.desc:0 "All good things have come to an end. While the last few days at my #italic munya#! have been quite fun, I and the others who have joined [host.GetTitledFirstName] at [host.GetHerHis] #italic munya#! for many days of relaxation and leisure have to return to our daily lives at some point. We had a great final banquet last night, and now, on this fine, beautiful morning, we must depart.\n\nNonetheless, I know we all had a great time, and it was a nice diversion from the stresses of daily life."
 wine_tasting.0073.a:0 "Perhaps I’ll host something like this at one of my #italic munyas#!."
 wine_tasting.0074.t:0 "My #italic Munya#! Gardens"
 wine_tasting.0074.desc:0 "For the past few days, I’ve let my guests tour some of the best and most brilliant gardens at my #italic munya#!. I have done much to ensure that these gardens are filled with all manner of wondrous plants, from exotic flowers with dazzling colors to imposing, large trees perfect for resting under. I also make sure to point out some of the fountains I’ve installed, whose splendid waterworks are thanks to the small canals that carry fresh water from the nearby river into my manor.\n\nIt seems my efforts have paid off, as I can see the amazement in my guests' eyes, as we relax in a corner of a garden - some on benches, others directly on the ground - as we chat and enjoy our time here."
 wine_tasting.0074.a:0 "I'm glad they're enjoying the gardens!"
 wine_tasting.0074.a.title:0 "Your guests spread word about your gardens!"
 wine_tasting.0075.t:0 "[host.GetTitledFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] #italic Munya#! Gardens"
 wine_tasting.0075.desc:0 "In the past few days, [host.GetTitledFirstName] has been showing us some of the best and most brilliant gardens at [host.GetHerHis] #italic munya#!. It’s clear that [host.GetSheHe] is very proud of them.\n\nThe other day, when I first walked into the manor and was, I noted some of the gardens from afar in passing. But to see them up close is another matter altogether! These gardens, as all garden should, are filled with not only plenty of spectacular plants - from strange but alluringly colorful flowers hailing from faraway lands, to tall, mighty trees with shade perfect for resting under - but they also have plenty of creative water elements like cool, refreshing fountains, and little canals that one can easily hop over and watch for hours on end.\n\nToday, we relax in one garden - some of us on benches, others sitting on the ground - as we chat and enjoy our time here."
 wine_tasting.0075.a:0 "I love socializing in such delightful places!"
 wine_tasting.0075.a.title:0 "Your enjoy socializing in the #italic munya#! gardens"
 wine_tasting.0075.b:0 "I want to relax and observe the scenery."
 wine_tasting.0075.b.title:0 "Your enjoy inspecting the #italic munya#! gardens"
 wine_tasting.0076.t:0 "A Cultured #italic Munya#!"
 wine_tasting.0076.desc:0 "Alongside my guests, I’ve also invited a few local scholars and poets to our excursion at my #italic munya#!. From my relaxing gardens, to the dining rooms, to the baths, to the various courtyards and gathering halls, I see many of my guests engaging in all manner of intellectual activity with each other.\n\nSome of my guests are debating the finer points of current politics, or theological and philosophical issues. Others are having poetry contests, where they recite beautiful poems to each other, whether about the beautiful scenes around them or about each other (from satirical to flattering). Yet others of a more quiet disposition appear to be enjoying a good game of chess with one another or reading scrolls from my library."
 wine_tasting.0076.a:0 "Overall, the atmosphere here is very cultured."
 wine_tasting.0076.a.title:0 "Your guests spread word about your cultured inclinations!"
 wine_tasting.0077.t:0 "A Cultured #italic Munya#!"
 wine_tasting.0077.desc:0 "[host.GetTitledFirstName] has encouraged us to participate in various intellectual activities in the past few days at [host.GetHerHis] #italic munya#!. The mark of a great [host.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip], after all, is one who is surrounded with people of culture and learning, and [host.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] has even invited a few local scholars and poets to join us on this excursion.\n\nThus, while this vacation isn’t the rowdiest one I’ve seen, it’s a delight, at least for those who are more intellectually inclined. Every day, I see some guests debate about political issues, or theology and philosophy. Others work on their literary skills, and compete in impromptu poetry contests. Yet others who are of a quieter disposition enjoy games of chess or reading scrolls from [host.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] library."
 wine_tasting.0077.a:0 "These intellectual discussions are illuminating."
 wine_tasting.0077.a.title:0 "You gain some intellectual insights"
 wine_tasting.0077.b:0 "Poetry has never been more rewarding."

 wine_tasting.0077.c.title.1:0 "You found a good book in the library"
 wine_tasting.0077.c.title.2:0 "Your chess matches are interesting games"
 wine_tasting.0078.t:0 "Partying at the #italic Munya#!"
 wine_tasting.0078.desc:0 "When #italic some#! people go to relax at a #italic munya#! with others, they might do more productive activities like discuss convoluted scholarly issues, explore the countryside, or conduct botanical experiments. Now, my guests and I have no time for such tedious pursuits!\n\nWhile my guests are free to do as they please (within reason), we’re here to have fun. I’ve made an effort in the past few days to provide my guests with plenty of food and drink so that we may indulge ourselves to our heart’s content, listen to energetic and delightful musical performances, and socialize with such an exciting gathering of good people who know how to enjoy life."
 wine_tasting.0078.a:0 "No need to be unhappy - we’re here for a good time!"
 wine_tasting.0078.a.title:0 "Your guests spread word about your amazing parties!"
 wine_tasting.0079.t:0 "Partying at the #italic Munya#!"
 wine_tasting.0079.desc:0 "[host.GetTitledFirstName] has been throwing us banquet after banquet while we’ve been here at [host.GetHerHis] #italic munya#!. Sure, this might not be the biggest, wildest feast I’ve ever attended, but there is a certain charm about having a party in a nice manor in the countryside.\n\nWhile we are certainly free to engage in other activities, I hardly seem to find time for myself! In the past few days, I’ve mostly been eating, drinking, enjoying delightful musical performances, or socializing with other people. Many of the others gathered here seem to be having a good time, without a doubt."
 wine_tasting.0079.a:0 "Is it time for our next feast already?"
