Try it!" [orc_participant.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] shouts at me while laughing intensely.\n\nAt first, it is hard to swallow, and my throat feels like it's burning... but then a great feeling of heat spreads around my body, and suddenly, I feel new strength and energy in my muscles.

 lotr_feast.0001.a: "[orc_participant.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], pour me another!"
 lotr_feast.0001.b: "That was enough for me."

 lotr_feast.0053.desc: "The feast-fires blaze hot, and [orc_potential_rival.GetFirstName] boasts of deeds that are *clearly* stolen from my own victories.\n\n"I cut down ten foes with a single swing!" they shout, waving a greasy bone like a blade.\n\nSeveral orcs glance my way.
