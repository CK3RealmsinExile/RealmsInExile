All my crewmates, though many of them are rowdy and roguish, stare in silence at the great harbour, the garth of royal ships. \n\nPelargir, O Pelargir, that wondrous haven of sights from across all Middle-earth! We have restored it to the Adûnaic roots and traditions it once held so dear. Now, travellers all the world over must admit that the Adûnâi are the greatest of the races of Men, and their feats have no equal - Pelargir foremost among them.\n\nThe Great King Castamir once held Pelargir dear to his heart, and wisely tried to restore the legacy of Anadûnê - but he was vilified by the Nimruzîrî of [gondor|E], and his line cast out. In our age, however, we few Adûnâi faithful have reclaimed Pelargir, proving our superiority over the idolators of the White Tree once and for all. \n\nFor a long while, we stand in awe of the city, partaking in merriment and pleasure, as is our right.

The crash of the waves upon the shore grows louder and more rhythmic, and my breath is as one with the ebb and flow of the tides.\n\nWhile I contemplate the trouble that faces me and my subjects, I gain sudden insights and realisations, the likes of which I have never felt before. \n\nLeaving the room, walking back up to Tol Aerhir, I can only conclude that [ulmocharacter|E] himself must have counseled me..."

Further inside the city, I see the remnants of Tarma Tar Calion, the memory of the last great king of Anadûnê, Ar-Pharazôn. Will I be able to bring our people to the same heights I wonder?\n\nI continue on through the busy streets of the Market District and observe the faded statues of the great Umbarean kings of the past - amongst them I see Herumor, Fuinur and even the righteous King Castamir himself.\n\nAs the sun sets, I return to my ship filled with hope and ambition for my future. I am certain, by the grace of the Adûnaic kings of old, I shall bring our people to new heights. One day, my heirs will walk the streets of Umbar gazing upon statues of my likeness."

As I pass over the hilly farmlands, my exhaustion comes to an abrupt end as I lay my eyes upon the imposing walls of Zadan an-Adûn - the jewel of Târikêth an-Kharat.\n\nTowering over the walls, I see a magnificent work of Adûnaic stonework, a remarkable fortress with a red hue. I enter the city through the main gates. As I wander the cobbled streets, I inspect the impeccable stonework of the city. Surely this is proof that the Anbalûkkhòri are true descendants of Anadûnê.\n\nFinally I enter the walls of the Red Citadel itself. Within the imposing citadel lies the seat of the Anbalûkkhòri throne. The halls are draped with pompous artwork, as well as luxurious goods and relics of old Anadûnê displayed proudly in the many halls of the keep.\n\nAs I leave the city and trot my way home, I ponder over the many great Adûnâi, loyal to the King’s Men of old, that ruled from this seat of power in ancient times."

I recall the namesake of this Arch; the honorable Adûnaic captain of the that discovered coast Bellakar and established Hazaj Tollin. I inspect the intricate details along the surface of the arch, which unlike the rest of the city remained intact after the great waves of the Akallabêth washed over this place.\n\nThe magnificent stoneworks of my ancestors are truly a sight to behold. I close my eyes and ponder over the noble deeds of my forefathers - the establishment of this settlement and the subjugation and subsequent ennoblement of the Haradrim. I am filled with a sense of pride and awe as I mount my horse and leave the city's boundaries."

I can sense the proud heritage of the Adûnâi as I explore the nooks and crannies of the city. Korlea was once a proud and fair city of the most loyal King’s Men of old.\n\nI stroll through the various districts until sundown, before I decide to return to my ship for a good night's sleep. My dreams take me to the near future of Korlea under firm King’s Men control. I see the silhouette of a kingly Adûnaic figure, sitting upon a Korelan throne while the masses cheer. The silhouette reminds me of... Me. The dream is intense, but I feel at ease."
