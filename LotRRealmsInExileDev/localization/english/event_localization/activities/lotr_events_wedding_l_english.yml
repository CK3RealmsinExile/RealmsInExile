 lotr_wedding.0001.desc:0 "As the wedding of my dearest daughter Arwen comes to an end comes a moment I have foreseen long ago, ever since she met my ward Estel in the woods of [lothlorien|E]. She came to me then, a new light shining on her face, to tell me of her meeting with Aragorn, who mistook her for a vision of Lúthien Tinúviel, the mother of my grandfather Dior Eluchil. Arwen told me then that her heart belonged to him forever.\n\nIt is a bittersweet moment for me, as this great joy for two of those closest to my heart spells the final separation from my kin. For now Arwen must accept the Gift of [conceptracemen|E] and one day perish and depart this world, while the [elves|E] remain until the end of days, and thus our fates are sundered forever. Through their union the line of kings will once again be ennobled with the blood of the Eldar, but this is small consolation.\n\nNever since my dear twin brother [elrosshort|E] left [middleearth|E] to become king of [numenor|E] have I felt such a deep, inconsolable sorrow."
