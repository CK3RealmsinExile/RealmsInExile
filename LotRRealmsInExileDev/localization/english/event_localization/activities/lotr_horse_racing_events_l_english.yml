 lotr_horse_race.0007.desc:0 "Ever since horse-races became more popular in this region, they have become a wonderful occasion for people to get together and celebrate their hometown.\n\nVarious cities and towns host their own races alongside other major occasions, but they can be chaotic affairs at times, ill-organized and messy. I have worked together with notables from [capital.GetNameNoTier] to inaugurate a major race there, which will be held regularly from now on, establishing a new tradition that will increase locals’ civic pride, and make [capital.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] famous in the region.\n\nIn particular, the race will be held"
 lotr_horse_race.0007.desc.religious:0 "during a major religious holiday already popular with the local populace. This new racing tradition will thus have heavy spiritual overtones, inspiring the locals by combining solemn faith and festive excitement."
 lotr_horse_race.0007.desc.civic:0 "to commemorate a major historical event in the history of [capital.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip]. The locals’ civic pride can only deepen if they remember why they should be proud of their hometown, after all."

 lotr_horse_race.0018.t:0 "The Written Legacy of the [ROOT.Char.GetDynasty.GetBaseNameNoTooltip]"
 lotr_horse_race.0018.desc:0 "Over time, the [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetName] people have made extensive use of written documents in order to keep track of endowments, donations, leases, purchases, litigation, and other financial and legal activities related to our religious institutions and buildings.\n\nMost [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetCollectiveNounNoTooltip] families of note, including the [ROOT.Char.GetDynasty.GetBaseName], have drafted a number of scrolls over the years. However, they are scattered about – some are kept at our own residences and offices, while others are stored at local [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HouseOfWorship], and they are not always in good condition.\n\nAs such, I have ordered for us to find as many of our family’s writings and recompile them. This will have great use for us in the future, such as when we are involved in legal disputes, want to engage in various transactions like selling or buying property, or even just to show to others our family’s past charitable deeds."
 lotr_horse_race.0018.a:0 "It’s a good thing we’re doing this now!"

 lotr_horse_race.0019.desc.intro:0 "It is expected for great [GetPlayer.GetCulture.GetName] houses like the [GetPlayer.GetHouse.GetName] to own a stable of finely bred racehorses, fast and enduring, but servile. While we have no shortage of fierce and powerful mounts, we have much room for improvement.\n\nThat is why"

 lotr_horse_race.0021.t:0 "Participating in the Horse Race?"
 lotr_horse_race.0021.desc:0 "The races are an excellent opportunity for great and small Houses alike to gain prestige and fame, and mine is no exception. There is honour and glory abound for any victors, yet a steep price too.\n\nIf I were to enroll any of my family's racehorses, there would be a great deal of training and preparation required, preparation that would come at no small cost."

 lotr_horse_race.0022.desc:0 "I have finally arrived at the racing grounds in [actual_location.GetName], and not a moment too soon. The crowds are abuzz with excitement, and servants and attendants scurry back and forth swift as the horses themselves as they prepare, while visitors arrive from far and near.\n\nSuch an event is not just the race itself – the race is, after all, simply the culmination of a period of festivities, so there is much works that needs to be done.

 lotr_horse_race.0024.desc:0 "Tonight, both residents of [actual_location.GetName] and visitors are participating in the opening banquet, and the [host.GetFaith.GetAdjective] offering ceremony. Hundreds of conversations all meld together, as peasants gather in throngs and esteemed nobles ride, cloaked in their finest garments, all marching in the same direction.\n\nThe procession takes us through town, accompanied by [host.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] and entertainers alike, until at least we reach a great hall. The doors swing open for us, revealing a grand, decorated hall, where the grand banquet is to be hosted.\n\nFood comes quickly, drinks even quicker."

 lotr_horse_race.0026.desc:0 "I set out to witness another great procession, before we offer more tribute at a major [host.GetFaith.HouseOfWorship] in [actual_location.GetName]. There is much revelry, but the excitement ramps up as the hour of the race approaches.\n\nIt is afternoon when the race starts, and the excitement is palpable. Crowds pour into the fields outside, huddling around the race tracks, while nobles sit in high seats. The smell of sweat and horse dung permeates the air, but it does little to bother me. The horses line up,"
 lotr_horse_race.0026.desc.horses:0 "and at towards the back I see the horse representing our house, decorated with our colors and emblems! My retainers and I cheer wildly, encouraging the rider, who tugs at the reins."
 lotr_horse_race.0026.desc.none:0 "and across the field I see horses bearing a myriad of different colors, bright and patterned; colours and emblems which belong to noble houses and a few commoners. The horses bristle under their cloaks, but they are broken, and ride as commanded. The land echoes with excited cheer."
 lotr_horse_race.0026.desc.conclusion:0 "\n\nA shrill trumpet pierces the air, and instantly the horses set off in a flash, leaving behind a trail of dust!"

 lotr_horse_race.0028.desc:0 "The earth seems to rumble and shudder; a shuddering that comes not only from the hoof-beats of lighting-fast horses, but from the cheers and hollers of the excited crowd. At last, the first horse passes the finish line, and an ear-splitting cheer arises.\n\n"
 lotr_horse_race.0028.desc.house_host:0 "My cheer is among them. The winning horse belongs to none other than our own [house|E] [ROOT.Char.GetHouse.GetName], our colours flapping in the breeze as the rider pulls on the reins and slows his steed down a halt. I leap from my seat, head ringing with excitement, and I raise my arms high.\n\nThe losers surely look at us enviously, and there are few feelings sweeter than that. The name of house [ROOT.Char.GetHouse.GetName] shall be on many men's lips."
 lotr_horse_race.0028.desc.house_other:0 "The winning horse belongs to [house|E] [lotr_horse_race_winner.GetHouse.GetName], sponsored by [lotr_horse_race_winner.GetTitledFirstName].

 lotr_horse_race.0028.desc.merchant:0 "The winning horse belongs to a merchant family that clearly paid well for it. They are not elite nobility, earning a few pouty glares from certain prestigious families, but they begrudgingly accept the victory."
 lotr_horse_race.0028.desc.patrician:0 "The winning horse belongs to one of the minor noble houses of [actual_location.GetNameNoTooltip]. This will surely be a great day in their family's history, and for a short while at least, they may bask in the limelight."
 lotr_horse_race.0028.desc.conclusion:0 "\n\nThe rider of the victorious steed, still slick with sweat, approaches the officials who organized this horse race to receive the champion's banner, as a sign of victory in this competition.

 # lotr_horse_race.0030.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! As horse races were often held on religious feast days, they were also an opportunity for the city and whoever organized the Racing races to perform charitable acts. These, however, also allowed the local government to play visible role in maintaining public order.

When we are all full, and done, the servants bring out a great pot, filled to the brim with a dark green liquid. As I stare silently into the slick membrane that covers it, I am told it is a concotion made of local herbs gathered from the fields, eaten after a meal to aid digestion.\n\nAround me, people slurp it down, but as I bring it closer to myself my nostrils are filled with a pungent stench. My stomach churns."
