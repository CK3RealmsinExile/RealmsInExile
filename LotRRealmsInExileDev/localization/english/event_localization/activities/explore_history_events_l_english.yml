 # History Exploration Start Event

 explore_history.0001.t:0 "An Age to Study"
 explore_history.0001.desc:0 "As the sun rises above the horizon, I stretch and make my way to the library. Pouring over the dusty tomes, I know I could never read them all in my lifetime. The histories of Middle Earth run deep into the distant past, with all manner of tales since time immemorial.\n\nWith so much to explore, I must focus my efforts on the era which interests me most."
 explore_history.0001.a:0 "The mythical Years of the Trees."
 explore_history.0001.b:0 "The legendary First Age."
 explore_history.0001.c:0 "The heroic Second Age."

 explore_history.0010.t:0 "The Years of the Trees"
 explore_history.0010.desc:0 "The Years of the Trees, also called the Days of Bliss or the Noontide of Valinor, were the long years that lay between the founding of Valinor and its darkening. During this time, Valinor was lit by the light of the Two Trees while Middle-earth lay in the Great Darkness.\n\nIt was in this age that the Elves awoke and the Valar waged the Battle of the Powers, the dark fortress of Utumno was destroyed, and Melkor was chained within the Halls of Mandos for three ages of the world. The elves of Valinor grew in skill and power, before Melkor spread lies and discord amongst them before the ultimate destruction of the Two Trees.\n\nYour scholars apologise for the small amount of literature available for this distant age. Perhaps in time, they will be able to uncover more."

 explore_history.0010.b:0 "On second thoughts, maybe a different age..."

 explore_history.0020.t:0 "The First Age"
 explore_history.0020.desc:0 "The First Age describes the events near the beginning of time. Also known as the Elder Days, the First Age saw the creation of the races of Arda, their flourishing in Valinor and Beleriand, their feats against Melkor and his eventual overthrow by the combined armies of Valar, Elves and Edain.\n\nThe first age saw some of Middle-earth's greatest triumphs and tragedies, and it ended when the Valar cast Melkor beyond the Gates of Night, banishing him into the timeless Void.\n\nYour librarians, chagrined, say that they have fewer records of this era than they had previously believed. They hope they shall have uncovered where the others were put soon."
 explore_history.0020.a:0 "Maybe I need better librarians! Perhaps a different age..."
 explore_history.0020.b:0 "On second thoughts, maybe a different age..."

 explore_history.0030.t:0 "The Second Age"
 explore_history.0030.desc:0 "Beginning in the 584th year after the Return of the Ñoldor to Middle-earth, the Second Age is the longest of the chronicled Ages. Beginning after the destruction of Beleriand in the War of Wrath, it saw the founding of Lindon and the creation of Númenor: the two major Elvish and Mannish kingdoms of the Age.\n\nIn this age were the Rings of Power forged, which would set the stage for the events of the later Second and the entirety of the Third Age. At this time the Númenóreans achieved the apex of their power and splendour before the world was remade and Númenor cast down in the Akallabeth. 3441 years after it began, the Second Age ended with the defeat of Sauron in the War of the Last Alliance.\n\nThe scholars sharing the room with you complain that several of the old tomes are currently on loan and hope they shall be returned soon. Until then, you shall have to content yourself with what is here."

 explore_history.0030.b:0 "On second thoughts, maybe a different age..."

 explore_history.0040.t:0 "The Third Age"
 explore_history.0040.desc:0 "The Third Age has been characterized by the rise and decline of the exiled Númenórean kingdoms, and the slow recovery of Sauron's power. In the meantime, the Elves and Dwarves and other peoples have done little new; also known as the Fading Years, this age has marked a slow waning of the Elves.\n\nThe scribes apologise that the selection of texts is currently so unexpectedly small. Most of the writings on this era are being copied into new editions, but they promise to inform you whenever a new volume is finished."

 explore_history.0050.desc:0 "My eyes heavy and the candle is burning low. Where did all that time go? I place a bookmark to remember my place before finally closing the old book. With a groan I sit back in my creaking chair, stretching out my weary limbs.\n\nA fascinating pastime, studying the past, but my back is stiff and sore."

 # The Sundering of the Elves

 explore_history.1001.t:0 "The Awakening of the Elves"
 explore_history.1001.desc:0 "On the far eastern shores of the lost Inland Sea of Helcar, in a bay that came to be known as Cuiviénen, the first Elves awoke from the sleep of Ilúvatar. Here they dwelt for a time, happy under the beauty of the stars in heaven and have ever since loved starlight and revered their creator Varda above all the Valar.\n\nBefore long, the fledgling elves were discovered by Melkor, who sent his dark agents to watch from the shadows and capture any elf that strayed too far from the Waters of Awakening. These unfortunate souls were imprisoned in the bowels of Utumno and, through slow arts of cruelty were corrupted and bred to form the Orcs in envy and mockery of the Elves.\n\nLater, the Elves were found by the Valar Oromë in his hunts upon Middle Earth, and he was seized with a desire to protect them. And so, it came to pass that the Powers made war upon Melkor to deliver the Elves from the clutches of evil, forever changing the face of Middle-Earth in the conflict and imprisoning Melkor in the Halls of Mandos for thousands of years."
 explore_history.1001.a:0 "Thank Eru for the protection of the Valar against such terrifying evil!"
 explore_history.1001.b:0 "It is right that Melkor was judged for his ill-deeds."
 explore_history.1001.c:0 "Melkor created his own race by capturing and corrupting the Elves? Intriguing..."

 explore_history.1002.t:0 "The Avari"
 explore_history.1002.desc:0 "With Morgoth humbled and in chains, Oromë came again to the Elves, and passionately called them to follow him to Valinor, promising them safety, tutelage, and light. The Elves sent three ambassadors from among them to travel to Valinor and speak for their people: Ingwë, Finwë, and Elwë.\n\nReturning from Valinor, they were so filled with awe by the glory and majesty of the Valar and the splendour of the light of the Trees that they urged their people to heed the summons of the Valar and make the long journey west to Valinor.\n\nThus, befell the First Sundering of the Elves. For while the kindred of Ingwë and some of the kindreds of Finwë and Elwë were willing to follow Oromë, there were many still that refused the call to leave the lands of their birth, as they loved Middle-Earth and the starlight above the unknown West and rumours of its burning light. These Elves became known as the Avari, the Unwilling, and would not meet their kindred again until many ages were past."
 explore_history.1002.a:0 "A tragic parting, but the Eldar were right to journey West."
 explore_history.1002.b:0 "After seeing nothing but wrath and deception from the Ainur, who can blame the Avari?"

 explore_history.1003.t:0 "The Vanyar"
 explore_history.1003.desc:0 "Once the Elves who answered the summons of the Valar set out on the Great Journey, they were further split into three groups. The smallest of these groups was led by Ingwë and were the most anxious to reach Valinor.\n\nThe Vanyar led the way, pushing ever westward at a great pace, becoming the first to reach the shores of the vast Belegaer Sea. It was here that the Valar Ulmo uprooted the large island known as Tol Eressëa from the middle of the ocean and, with the help of his servants, used it to ferry the Vanyar from the shore and across the waves to the land of Valinor. For his haste and his zeal, Ingwë was crowned High-King of all the Elves.\n\nThe Vanyar loved the Valar and the light of Valinor above all else, choosing never to return to Middle-Earth, save to fight in the War of Wrath in the final overthrow of Melkor at the end of the First Age."
 explore_history.1003.a:0 "Such devotion and unwavering dedication to a single cause is inspiring."
 explore_history.1003.b:0 "Who can blame them? I'd have been on the first boat to Valinor too!"
 explore_history.1003.c:0 "High-King of all the Elves! Sounds like a lot of work..."

 explore_history.1004.t:0 "The Ñoldor"
 explore_history.1004.desc:0 "The next to arrive were the Elves known as the Ñoldor, led by Finwë, making good time but not bearing the same burning determination of the Vanyar. When they arrived in Valinor they built the city of Tirion upon the green hill of Túna with the help of the Vanyar in the gap of the Pelóri Mountains, and it was here that Finwë ruled over his people.\n\nThe Ñoldor are accounted as the most skilled among all the Elves in lore and smithing, the greatest among them being Finwë's son Fëanor, creator of the famed Silmarils. Many Ñoldor would eventually return to Middle-Earth to fight against Melkor and form the most well-known of the great Elven kingdoms."
 explore_history.1004.a:0 "The Ñoldor mastery of craftsmanship is amazing, they have the blessing of Aulë!"
 explore_history.1004.b:0 "Those gems caused more trouble than they were worth... what folly!"

 explore_history.1005.t:0 "The Teleri"
 explore_history.1005.desc:0 "Finally came the Elves known as the Teleri led by the brothers Olwë and Elwë and largest of the three kindreds who set out on the Great Journey. Unlike their Vanyar and Ñoldor brethren, the Teleri were a diverse group with great portions of their disunited host settling along the way without ever making it to Valinor.\n\nIn the woods of Rhovanion the Silvan and Nandor settled while the Green-Elves settled the forests of Ossiriand and the Ered Luin. The Sindar made their home in Doriath after tarrying there to try to find their leader Elwë, who had become enraptured with the Maia Melian. Last were the Falathrim who settled the coasts of Beleriand, taking Nowë (in later years known as Círdan) as their lord.\n\nFinally, those remaining few that completed the Great Journey to Valinor under the leadership of Olwë founded the city of Alqualondë, the Haven of the Swans, and became known as the Falmari."
 explore_history.1005.a:0 "A lesson in perseverance, and the rewards of seeing things through to the end."
 explore_history.1005.b:0 "Why rush to Valinor when there is so much wonder in Middle-Earth!"
 explore_history.1005.c:0 "These Teleri must have been harder to herd than cats! And how can you just... lose a king?"

 # The Siege of Angband and the Realms of Beleriand

 explore_history.2001.t:0 "The Siege of Angband and the Realms of Beleriand"
 explore_history.2001.desc:0 "After their victory in the Dagor Aglareb, the reunited Ñoldor assumed defensive positions encircling Thangorodrim, unwilling yet to assail it, perceiving they could not at the time overcome it. They deemed that the time had come to make their realms in peace and grow strong over the long years. Thus, the realms of Beleriand solidified into the forms they would hold for much of the First Age, guarded behind the swords of the Ñoldor.\n\nIn the mountain deeps of Beleriand the Dwarven clans of the Broadbeams and Firebeards made their homes in the great halls of Belegost (Gabilgathol) and Nogrost (Tumunzahar). These were the westernmost mansions of the Dwarves, and prosperous in their day. They traded with both the Sindar and the Ñoldor of eastern Beleriand and were counted close allies of the House of Fëanor. Some of the dwarves of Nogrod aided Finrod Felagund in the creation of his subterranean city of Nargothrond."
 explore_history.2001.a:0 "There was wisdom in biding their time."
 explore_history.2001.b:0 "Only by the vigilance of the Ñoldor was Morgoth contained!"
 explore_history.2001.c:0 "Defense was the right choice - let the enemy break on your walls!"

 explore_history.2002.t:0 "Realms of the Seven Lords"
 explore_history.2002.desc:0 "The realms of the Ñoldor in Eastern Beleriand were those of the Fëanorian Host, which split amongst the Seven Lords, the sons of Fëanor. Maedhros the Tall, head of the house, made his home in the great fortress of Himring, set high atop a hill east of the Pass of Aglon and west of Maglor's Gap. He dwelt there with Maglor, who sallied forth with his cavalry to patrol the Gap.\n\nCelegorm and Curufin made their abode in Himlad, and fortified Aglon, the pass through which one passed from Himring into Dorthonion. Caranthir and his people settled on the shores of Lake Helevorn. Through Caranthir’s land flowed all trade from the Dwarven realms of Nogrod and Belegost, and through his realm came all the waves of men that would eventually come into Beleriand. He was no fan of the Dwarves, or of the Men that came through his lands, but they made him fabulously wealthy.\n\nAmrod and Amras, the youngest of the sons of Fëanor, made their home in the great plains of southern Beleriand. The least active of the Sons of Fëanor in the Siege, their realm was one which helped supply their northern kin with food and supplies for the war."
 explore_history.2002.a:0 "I wonder how Maglor could've held such a vast territory with cavalry alone?"
 explore_history.2002.b:0 "Caranthir's example is a good one - tolerance is the path to wealth."
 explore_history.2002.c:0 "I would much rather live with the Ambarussa - let other have the fight, I shall farm!"

 explore_history.2003.t:0 "The Realms of the House of Fingolfin"
 explore_history.2003.desc:0 "While the House of Fëanor took the east, the House of Fingolfin held the northwest of Beleriand. Fingolfin, High-King of the Ñoldor in Middle-Earth ruled from Hithlum, by the northern shores of Lake Mithrim. A misty, heavily forested land, it was also the traditional seat of the High-King. His son and heir, Fingon, ruled over the southern region of Hithlum, Dor-lómin, where the Edain House of Hador would eventually settle during the Long Peace. These warlike, tall, blonde Edain became an important part of the Ñoldor's defenses, most numenorous of the Men of Beleriand.\n\nTurgon settled first at Vinyamar, in Nevrast on the slopes of Mount Taras. Yet Turgon in time abandoned it in favour of the legendary hidden citadel of Gondolin, which he began to build in F.A. 64. By the 116th year of the Sun the city was full-wrought, and Vinyamar was abandoned utterly. Gondolin, the hidden city of the Ñoldor, was made in the memory of Tirion upon Tuna, and within the encircling mountains it would endure beyond all other of their realms."
 explore_history.2003.a:0 "It was a well-calculated move integrating the Hadorim into their forces."
 explore_history.2003.b:0 "Why would you abandon a perfectly good city like that?"
 explore_history.2003.c:0 "Turgon was farsighted indeed - secrecy was ever the best hope of the Ñoldor..."
 
 explore_history.2004.t:0 "The Realms of the House of Finarfin"
 explore_history.2004.desc:0 "Finrod son of Finarfin first established his realm in the tower of Minas Tirith, set on the island of Tol Sirion in the narrow pass between the Ered Wethrin and Dorthonion. In time, seeking to answer the dream sent unto him by Ulmo, Finrod made his dwelling in the great underground city of Nargothrond. Minas Tirith passed to his nephew, Orodreth.\n\nThe location for his city was given to him by Elu Thingol, and the dwarves of Nogrod helped him to delve it. It was the capital of the realm of the same name, between Nenning, Narog and Teiglin, including the surrounding hills of Taur-en-Faroth and the Talath Dirnen to the north, as well as Tumhalad. From this mighty underground seat Finrod was the overlord of all the Elves in the West Beleriand not under the house of Fingolfin, save the Falathrim, who still acknowledged Elu Thingol as their king.\n\nAngrod and Aegnor made their abode in the highland region of Dorthonion, and it was their realm in which the men of the House of Beor originally settled before they were overrun in the Dagor Bragollach."
 explore_history.2004.a:0 "Wait - Minas Tirith? As that of Gondor? How big was it?"
 explore_history.2004.b:0 "It was kind to allow the House of Beor to settle amongst them."
 explore_history.2004.c:0 "To make a subterranean realm... how much work it must have been!"

 explore_history.2005.t:0 "Kingdoms of the Sindar"
 explore_history.2005.desc:0 "In the centre of Beleriand, an island in the sea of Ñoldor princes, laid the forest realm of Doriath, with its great capital of Menegroth. Ruled by Elu Thingol and protected by his wife Melian, it was a realm sealed from the outside world, with only the House of Finarfin allowed to enter therein of all the Ñoldor. Its lord, Thingol, claimed to be the King of All Beleriand, a claim scoffed at by the Ñoldor princes. In the safety of Doriath, the Sindar lived in peace and plenty.\n\nThe Falathrim lived upon the coasts of Beleriand under their lord Cirdan, primarily within the great havens of Eglarest and Brithombar. They professed continued loyalty to Elu Thingol as their rightful king, but many speculate that in reality the Falathrim felt closer to the Ñoldor they lived and fought alongside than their isolationist kin, who knew not the fears and tribulations of the Elves living outside the Girdle of Melian.\n\nLast of all were the Laiquendi. They dwelt in the land of the seven rivers, Ossiriand, in the shadow of the Ered Luin. They lived in small, secluded refuges on the rivers and in the forests of the land, living simple lives, not fighting in the great war, though some of them were eventually counted amongst the people of Amrod and Amras."
 explore_history.2005.a:0 "The gall of those Ñoldor, deriding the King of Beleriand!"
 explore_history.2005.b:0 "Friendship and trust served the Falathrim better than Doriath's isolation."
 explore_history.2005.c:0 "I empathize with the Laiquendi! I just want to be left alone..."

 # The Lost Island of Númenor

 explore_history.3001.t:0 "The Founding of Númenor"
 explore_history.3001.desc:0 "Recognising the immense sacrifices made by the Fathers of Men in the War of Wrath and the preceding battles of Beleriand, the Valar decreed to raise up for them a land in which they may live in peace and plenty. From the Great Sea of Belegaer arose the isle of Elenna, the five-pointed Star, and upon it was established the famed kingdom of Númenor. The surviving members of the three houses of the Edain made landfall there in S.A. 32 and took for their king Elros, son of Eärendil, who took the name Tar-Minyatur (High First Ruler in the Quenya tongue).\n\nIn those early years Eönwë, herald of Manwë dwelt amongst the Númenóreans, teaching them much in the ways of craft and lore. He was joined in this task by the Falmari Elves of Tol Eressëa, who would often come by ship out of the West. Great friendship there was in those days between the Elves and the Men of Númenor. And so, the prosperity and wisdom of the Númenóreans grew in leaps and bounds, until Númenor resembled Valinor in its bliss, remade in mannish guise."
 explore_history.3001.a:0 "From the generosity of Eönwë came a renaissance for Men."
 explore_history.3001.b:0 "After all the Edain endured, they were owed such recognition!"
 explore_history.3001.c:0 "How many years it must have taken to built it all!"

 explore_history.3002.t:0 "Forostar and Orrostar"
 explore_history.3002.desc:0 "Númenor was divided into six regions, with its central peak and each point of the star-shaped landmass mass having their own distinct character and unique role to play in the greater Númenorean state.\n\nForostar was the great Northern promontory of Númenor, a rugged land of cliffs and high moors with woods of fir and larch. Travelling North, the land became rockier and more mountainous culminating at the peak of Sorontil, where the land fell sheer into the sea forming tremendous cliffs. This was the abode of Eagles and from this rocky land came the vast quantities of stone needed to build the great cities of Númenor.\n\nOrrostar was the eastern promontory of Númenor. A range of hills ran along its northern coast which protected the region from cold North-Easterly winds. Orrostar held some of the most important farmlands of Númenor where much grain was grown."
 explore_history.3002.a:0 "Tall mountains and lush fields... Oh to live the simple life!"
 explore_history.3002.b:0 "Sheer cliffs with the risk of falling into deep water? Not my style..."
 explore_history.3002.c:0 "I wonder how they transported all that stone?"

 explore_history.3003.t:0 "Hyarnustar and Andustar"
 explore_history.3003.desc:0 "Hyarnustar was the southwestern region of Númenor and was the wine country of the region, hosting large palatial plantations. The Southernmost section of the promontory became more mountainous but remained green throughout the year.\n\nAndustar was the western promontory of Númenor and was a fertile region. Its western shores were broken by three bays, with the northernmost of these being the Bay of Andúnië. On the high land around this bay, the Númenóreans built the port and city of Andúnië, whose Lords were to be the ancestors of the Kings of Arnor and Gondor.\n\nShared between Hyarnustar and Andustar was the region of Nísimaldar (Land of Fragrant Trees), the region surrounding the great haven of Eldalondë. In this region were the exotic plants of Tol Eressea planted and cultivated, and the region was dominated by the great Mallorn trees, from which are descended the Mallorn trees of Lothlórien."
 explore_history.3003.a:0 "Wine? Great idea. Fetch me another glass!"
 explore_history.3003.b:0 "Those lords sound important. I bet they could do whatever they wanted!" 
 explore_history.3003.c:0 "Mallorn trees? Few now are left of their like… a great tragedy."

 explore_history.3004.t:0 "Hyarrostar and Mittalmar"
 explore_history.3004.desc:0 "Hyarrostar was the wide promontory that spread out to the south and east of Númenor. Along its Southern shores were wide beaches of white sands, and on its Western borders, where the shorelands were interrupted by the mouths of the River Siril, stood the township of Nindamos. The Hyarrostar was most famous for its trees, and it held great plantations that provided much of the wood used by Númenor's shipwrights.\n\nMittalmar was a pastoral region of grassland and pasture that lay in the central parts of the island. The eastern part of the Mittalmar was the most important region on the whole island. This was Arandor, the Kingsland, where the royal city of Armenelos stood, as well as the bustling eastern port of Rómenna."
 explore_history.3004.a:0 "The bustling cities of the Kingsland sound too busy for my liking..."
 explore_history.3004.b:0 "I bet there was plenty of 'fun' to be had in the docks of Rómenna!"
 explore_history.3004.c:0 "Golden Armenelos… a perfect place to network and make allies."

 explore_history.3005.t:0 "The Meneltarma"
 explore_history.3005.desc:0 "From the plains of Mittalmar rose a single tall mountain, the famous Meneltarma, the Holy Mountain and Pillar of Heaven. Birds and animals did not approach the mountain, and only the Eagles of Manwë,  sacred guardians of the mountain and all the land, were seen circling over its summit.\n\nThe Meneltarma was sacred to the Númenóreans as a holy place devoted to Eru Ilúvatar. All who set foot on the mountain were required to keep a solemn silence, save for the King who would utter prayers and thanksgivings on behalf of his people. The Three Prayers of Erukyermë, Erulaitalë and Eruhantalë were held to mark the passing of the seasons at its sacred peak, where attendee would dress in white and wear garlands to make bloodless offerings of fruit in thanks and praise of Ilúvatar."
 explore_history.3005.a:0 "A place of perfect peace and quiet contemplation."
 explore_history.3005.b:0 "Who needs grand banquets when simple fruit will suffice?"

 explore_history.4001.t:0 "Marhwini's People"
 explore_history.4001.desc:0 "After the Battle of the Plains (T.A. 1856), much of the Kingdom of Rhovanion was lost to the Wainriders and its people were enslaved. The northern Lord Marhwini with the remnants of his people travelled West to the Vales of Anduin. They were soon joined by fugitives from Mirkwood whose lands had met a similar fate and established themselves between the bank of the River Anduin and the edge of Mirkwood Forest.\n\nGondor had also been fighting the Wainrider threat from the East and, in T.A. 1899, Marhwini warned King Calimehtar that the Wainriders were plotting to raid the Gondorian province of Clenardhon over the Undeeps.\n\nIn a pre-emptive strike, King Calimehtar sent a great host out of Ithilien to meet the unprepared Wainriders at the plain of Dagorlad. With the Undeeps left undefended, Marwhini's horsemen were able to ride unhindered alongside Gondorian cavalry into the enemy flank, scattering them in disarray.\n\nFollowing the battle, Marhwini's éored continued to harass their foreign overlords and led a successful rebellion to regain their freedom."
 explore_history.4001.a:0 "There would have been no victory without cooperation."

 explore_history.4002.t:0 "The Éothéod"
 explore_history.4002.desc:0 "The descendants of Marhwini and his people came to become known as the Éothéod. In T.A. 1973, Éothéod princes led their bands of tall and fair riders from the Vales of Anduin to once again join forces with Gondor and form the Host of the West to fight against Angmar. Through companionship in arms and blood shed together, the Éothéod became well-known to Gondor as a people in whom they could trust.\n\nTwo years later, after the fall of Angmar, Lord Frumgar led the Éothéod to a new land north of Mirkwood, between the Misty Mountains and the Forest River, away from the ravages of the Easterlings and Orcs. In time, this land also came to be known as Éothéod as Frumgar's people made their homes there.\n\nSome time later their king Fram, son of Frumgar, slew the dragon Scatha and the Éothéod capital was named Framsburg in his honour."
 explore_history.4002.a:0 "What a time to be alive, there's so much to learn about the Witch King from his stolen land!"
 explore_history.4002.b:0 "Few cross paths with a dragon and live to tell the tale... Such bravery is to be admired."
 explore_history.4002.c:0 "Sure... he 'slayed' a dragon. Sounds like the perfect way to get a city named after you!"

 explore_history.4003.t:0 "Stranded"
 explore_history.4003.desc:0 "In T.A. 2510, the fierce Easterlings known as the Balchoth waged open war against a weakened Gondor, crossing the Anduin and passing into the north of Calenardhon. In desperate hope, they sent word to their ancient Éothéod allies seeking aid, but received no response.\n\nThe Balchoth faced little resistance as they ran rampant through the mostly abandoned province, and by the time the Northern Army of Gondor sallied forth from their fortresses, the bulk of the enemy's army had already arrived. In a valiant counter attack by the ruling Steward Cirion, Gondor managed to drive the Balchoth back to the Wold, only to find themselves cut off as the reinforcing Southern Army was assailed en route by an orcish band descending from the mountains.\n\nThus, the Steward and his fellow Dúnedain found themselves backed against the river in a hopeless situation."
 explore_history.4003.a:0 "How gripping! I trust the Éothéod will come through in the end... won't they?"
 explore_history.4003.b:0 "What folly! Leaving the strength of their forts to meet the enemy in the open field..."

 explore_history.4004.t:0 "The Ride of Eorl"
 explore_history.4004.desc:0 "At this crucial time, the Éothéod under their leader Eorl the Young suddenly appeared, unexpected by friend or foe, responding to the call for aid and remembering their old friendship with Gondor. Eorl perceived then that if Gondor should fall, no land would long live free from the Darkness, and that the Éothéod should brave even the terror of Dol Guldur if needed to secure that freedom.\n\nLong and hard did they ride, coming South at a speed beyond hope. The Éothéod crossed the Anduin at the Undeeps of the river and with a great blaring of horns, a thundering charge came onto the rear-guard of the Balchoth.\n\nSet upon with a deep terror, the Balchoth broke before the fury of the Northmen and the Gondorian armies were saved, with the Éothéod continuing their foray into northern Gondor, scattering and destroying all the Balchoth in Calenardhon."

There he led him to the hidden tomb of Elendil the Tall, where he offered to Eorl and his people all the lands of Calenardhon from Anduin to Isen, in solemn recognition of the great valour and sacrifice of the Éothéod, with the sole condition that the Éothéod should dwell there forever a friend to Gondor, and that they should share friend and foe alike.\n\nAwed by the magnanimity of this gift, Eorl accepted in the name of his people and there, upon the tomb of Elendil, did the Steward and King swear a great oath, affirming what they had said before.\n\nEorl then returned to the north, to bring his people to settle Calenardhon, while Cirion returned south to Minas Tirith. Thus, was the Oaths of Eorl and Cirion sworn, and the people of Gondor and Rohan bound perpetually in friendship and alliance against all foes."
