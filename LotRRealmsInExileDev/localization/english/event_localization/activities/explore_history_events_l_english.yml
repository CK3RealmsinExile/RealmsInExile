 # History Exploration Start Event

 explore_history.0001.t: "An Age to Study"
 explore_history.0001.desc: "As all my guests have arrived and my scholars are as prepared as they're likely to be, I make my way to the library. Pouring over the dusty tomes, I know I could never read them all in my lifetime. The histories of [middleearth|E] run deep into the distant past, with all manner of tales since time immemorial.\n\nWith so much to explore, I must focus my efforts on the era that interests me most."
 
 explore_history.0001.a: "The mythical Years of the Trees"
 explore_history.0001.b: "The legendary First Age"
 explore_history.0001.c: "The heroic Second Age"

 explore_history.0010.t: "The Years of the Trees"
 explore_history.0010.desc: "The Years of the Trees, also called the Days of Bliss or the Noontide of [valinor|E], were the long years that lay between the founding of Valinor and its darkening. During this time, Valinor was lit by the light of the [twotrees|E] while [middleearth|E] lay in the Great Darkness.\n\nIt was in this age that the [elves|E] awoke and the [valargods|E] waged the Battle of the [powersgods|E], the dark fortress of [utumno|E] was destroyed, and [melkorcharacter|E] was chained within the Halls of [mandoscharacter|E] for three ages of the world. The Elves of Valinor grew in skill and power, before Melkor spread lies and discord amongst them before the ultimate destruction of the Two Trees."

 explore_history.0020.t: "The First Age"
 explore_history.0020.desc: "The [firstage|E] describes the events near the beginning of [loretime|E]. Also known as the [elderdays|E], the First Age saw the awakening of Men on [ardaconcept|E], the flourishing of [elves|E] in [valinor|E] and [beleriand|E], their feats against [melkorcharacter|E] and his eventual overthrow by the combined armies of [valargods|E], Elves and Edain.\n\nThe first age saw some of [middleearth|E]'s greatest triumphs and tragedies, and it ended when the Valar cast Melkor beyond the Gates of Night, banishing him into the timeless [thevoid|E]."

 explore_history.0030.t: "The Second Age"
 explore_history.0030.desc: "Beginning in the 584th year after the Return of the [noldorelves|E] to [middleearth|E], the [secondage|E] is the longest of the chronicled [ages|E]. Beginning after the destruction of [beleriand|E] in the [warofwrath|E], it saw the founding of [lindon|E] and the creation of [numenor|E]: the two major [elvish|E] and [mannish|E] kingdoms of the Age.\n\nIn this age were the [ringsofpower|E] forged, which would set the stage for the events of the later Second and the entirety of the [thirdage|E]. At this time the [numenoreans|E] achieved the apex of their power and splendour before the world was remade and Númenor cast down in the [akallabeth|E]. 3441 years after it began, the Second Age ended with the defeat of [sauroncharacter|E] in the [warlastalliance|E].\n\nThe scholars in this section are extremely smug at the number of works in their field of study, enough to fill two reading rooms. Which one should I choose?"

 explore_history.0040.desc: "The [thirdage|E] has been characterized by the rise and decline of the exiled [numenorean|E] kingdoms and the slow recovery of [sauroncharacter|E]'s power. In the meantime, the [elves|E] and [dwarves|E] and other peoples have done little new; also known as the Fading Years, this age has marked a slow waning of the Elves.\n\nThe scribes apologise that the selection of texts is currently unexpectedly incomplete.

With a groan I sit back in my creaking chair, stretching out my weary limbs.\n\nA fascinating pastime, studying the past, but my back is stiff and sore."

 # The Sundering of the Elves

 explore_history.1001.t: "The Awakening of the Elves"
 explore_history.1001.desc: "On the far eastern shores of the lost Inland Sea of Helcar, in a bay that came to be known as [cuivienen|E], the first [elves|E] awoke from the sleep of [iluvatar|E]. Here they dwelt for a time, happy under the beauty of the stars in heaven, and have ever since loved starlight and revered their creator [vardacharactershort|E] above all the [valargods|E].\n\nBefore long, the fledgling Elves were discovered by [melkorcharacter|E], who sent his dark agents to watch from the shadows and capture any Elf that strayed too far from the Waters of Awakening. These unfortunate souls were imprisoned in the bowels of [utumno|E] and, through slow arts of cruelty, were corrupted and bred to form the [orcs|E] in envy and mockery of the Elves.\n\nLater, the Elves were found by the Vala [oromecharactershort|E] in his hunts upon [middleearth|E], and he was seized with a desire to protect them. And so, it came to pass that the [powersgods|E] made war upon Melkor to deliver the Elves from the clutches of evil, forever changing the face of Middle-earth in the conflict and imprisoning Melkor in the Halls of [mandoscharacter|E] for thousands of years."
 
 explore_history.1001.a: "Thank Eru for the protection of the Valar against such terrifying evil!"
 explore_history.1001.b: "It is right that Melkor was judged for his ill deeds."
 explore_history.1001.c: "Melkor created his own race by capturing and corrupting the Elves? Intriguing..."

 explore_history.1002.t: "The Avari"
 explore_history.1002.desc: "With [melkorcharacter|E] humbled and in chains, [oromecharactershort|E] came again to the [elves|E], and passionately called them to follow him to [valinor|E], promising them safety, tutelage, and light. The Elves sent three ambassadors from among them to travel to Valinor and speak for their people: [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofingwe3').GetFirstName], [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineoffinwe1').GetFirstName], and [elwe|E].\n\nReturning from Valinor, they were so filled with awe by the glory and majesty of the [valargods|E] and the splendour of the light of the [twotrees|E] that they urged their people to heed the summons of the Valar and make the long journey west to Valinor.\n\nThus, befell the First Sundering of the Elves. For while the kindred of Ingwë and some of the kindreds of Finwë and Elwë were willing to follow Oromë, there were many still that refused the call to leave the lands of their birth, as they loved [middleearth|E] and the starlight above the unknown West and rumours of its burning light. These Elves became known as the [avari|E], the Unwilling, and would not meet their kindred again until many ages were past."
 
 explore_history.1002.a: "A tragic parting, but the Eldar were right to journey West."
 explore_history.1002.b: "After seeing nothing but wrath and deception from the Ainur, who can blame the Avari?"

 explore_history.1003.t: "The Vanyar"
 explore_history.1003.desc: "Once the [elves|E] who answered the summons of the [valargods|E] set out on the [greatjourney|E], they were further split into three groups. The smallest of these groups was led by [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofingwe3').GetFirstName] and was the most anxious to reach [valinor|E].\n\nThe [vanyarelves|E] led the way, pushing ever westward at a great pace, becoming the first to reach the shores of the vast [belegaer_sea|E]. It was here that the Vala [ulmocharacter|E] uprooted the large island known as [toleressea|E] from the middle of the ocean and, with the help of his servants, used it to ferry the Vanyar from the shore and across the waves to the land of Valinor. For his haste and his zeal, Ingwë was crowned High-King of all the Elves.\n\nThe Vanyar loved the Valar and the light of Valinor above all else, choosing never to return to [middleearth|E], save to fight in the [warofwrath|E] in the final overthrow of [melkorcharacter|E] at the end of the [firstage|E]."
 
 explore_history.1003.a: "Such devotion and unwavering dedication to a single cause is inspiring."
 explore_history.1003.b: "Who can blame them? I'd have been on the first boat to Valinor too!"
 explore_history.1003.c: "High-King of all the Elves! Sounds like a lot of work..."

 explore_history.1004.t: "The Ñoldor"
 explore_history.1004.desc: "The next to arrive were the [elves|E] known as the [noldorelves|E], led by Finwë, making good time but not bearing the same burning determination of the [vanyarelves|E]. When they arrived in [valinor|E] they built the city of [GetTitleByKey('k_tirion').GetNameNoTier] upon the green hill of Túna with the help of the Vanyar in the gap of the Pelóri Mountains, and it was here that [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineoffinwe1').GetFirstName] ruled over his people.\n\nThe Ñoldor are accounted as the most skilled among all the Elves in lore and smithing, the greatest among them being Finwë's son [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineoffinwe3').GetFirstName], creator of the famed [silmarils|E]. Many Ñoldor would eventually return to [middleearth|E] to fight against [melkorcharacter|E] and form the most well-known of the great Elven kingdoms."
 
 explore_history.1004.a: "The Ñoldor's mastery of craftsmanship is amazing, they have Aulë's blessing!"
 explore_history.1004.b: "Those gems caused more trouble than they were worth... what folly!"

 explore_history.1005.t: "The Teleri"
 explore_history.1005.desc: "Finally came the [elves|E] known as the [telerielves|E] led by the brothers [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofolwe1').GetFirstName] and [elwe|E], and the largest of the three kindreds, who set out on [greatjourney|El]. Unlike their [vanyarelves|E] and [noldorelves|E] brethren, the Teleri were a diverse group with great portions of their disunited host settling along the way without ever making it to [valinor|E].\n\nIn the woods of [rhovanion|E] the [silvanelves|E] and Nandor settled, while the Green-Elves settled the forests of Ossiriand and the [eredluin|E]. The [sindarelves|E] made their home in [GetTitleByKey('k_doriath').GetNameNoTier] after tarrying there to try to find their leader Elwë, who had become enraptured with the [maiagod|E] [meliancharacter|E]. Last were the [falathrim|E] who settled the coasts of [beleriand|E], taking Nowë (in later years known as [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofcirdan').GetFirstName]) as their lord.\n\nFinally, those remaining few that completed the Great Journey to Valinor under the leadership of Olwë founded the city of [GetTitleByKey('k_alqualonde').GetNameNoTier], the Haven of the Swans, and became known as the [falmarielves|E]."
 
 explore_history.1005.a: "A lesson in perseverance, and the rewards of seeing things through to the end."
 explore_history.1005.b: "Why rush to Valinor when there is so much wonder in Middle-earth!"
 explore_history.1005.c: "These Teleri must have been harder to herd than cats! And how can you just... lose a king?"

 # Of Fëanor and the Disquiet of the Noldor

 explore_history.1011.t: "The Youth of Fëanor"
 explore_history.1011.desc: "In [valinor|E], when the world was young, King [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineoffinwe1').GetFirstName] of the [noldorelves|E] wed [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineoffinwe2').GetFirstName], who was called Serindë because of her skill in needlework. She bore him a son, whom she called [feanor|E], Spirit of Fire. But Míriel said to Finwë, "Never again shall I bear a son, for the strength that would have nourished many has gone forth into [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineoffinwe3').GetFirstName]." After which she departed to rest in the gardens of [loriencharacter|E], never to wake again.\n\nFinwë grieved much for the departure of his wife, and all his love he gave to his son.

# The Foundation of Bellakar by RedArkady

 explore_history.3011.desc: "[numenorean|E] mariners first reached the shores of [bellakar|E] around 1100 of the Second Age. They found a thriving if primitive people living along the fertile coast who called themselves ‘the Bellanarûd’, and their land ‘Bellakar’. In time the loremasters of the [dunedain|E] realised that the Bellanarûd must have had some contact with the [avari|E] in the distant past. Indeed, the name ‘Bellakar’ appeared to have been derived from an Avarin equivalent to the [sindarin|E] name for the sea, ‘[belegaer_sea|E]’. Similarly, the local name for the coast, ‘Felaya’, seemed related to the Sindarin word ‘Falas’. \n\nSoon, the Númenóreans began to settle among the Bellanarûd, building great settlements along the coast. They taught them much lore, and in turn learned how to adapt to the arid climate of Bellakar."

This was followed in S.A. 1487 by the foundation of a key settlement at the inland oasis of Ithillond (later the [bellakari|E] capital Nîlûlondê), initially to control the trade routes into the interior. Further havens were established along the coast in the following centuries: Osto Nórëanarva ([GetTitleByKey('d_urezayan').GetNameNoTier]) in S.A. 1644, and Sornomar ([GetTitleByKey('d_narik_zadan').GetNameNoTier]) in S.A. 1780, and [GetTitleByKey('d_korlea').GetNameNoTier] in S.A. 1975. \n\nMany of the [adunai|E] intermingled with the native Bellanarûd, and a distinct people of mixed blood began to emerge - the Bellakaze. Yet in many cities the Adûnâi kept all power in their own hands, and the local oligarchies were often restricted to those with pure Adûnâi blood. In others, the Bellakaze began to exercise more influence. The Bellanarûd became increasingly marginalised as the Adûnâi grew in strength and arrogance, sowing the seeds of many future conflicts. \n\nIn S.A. 2022 Tar-[GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofelros13').GetFirstNameRegnal] decreed the formation of the Council of Free Cities, giving the cities of Bellakar a loose confederal government."

The [numenorean|E]s had come as friends and teachers, but were increasingly becoming oppressors. The growth of the [kingsmen|E] faction, and the impious rebuffing of the emissaries of the [valargods|E] by Tar-[GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofelros14').GetFirstName], also created outrage in [bellakar|E].

Though Hazaj Tollin did not fall, the Royal Fleet was able to use the Korlean-controlled ports and fortresses of southern Bellakar to reassert control in a brutal fifteen-year conflict. In S.A. 2237 the rebellious cities accepted peace terms, and the Council of Free Cities was formally abolished. The victory of Mûrathôr left Bellakar bitterly polarised, for many (particularly in Hazaj Tollin and Ithillond) had learned to despise the King’s Men."

However, this enriching of Korlea reduced the annual tribute reaching [numenor|E], resulting in the southern colonies being centralised under a new regime ruling from [anbalkumagan|E]. \n\nThe new lord of Anbalukkhôr, Azrubên of Rómenna, rolled back Korlean privileges to gain support in the rest of Bellakar, and reformed the Council of Free Cities (the Bâitha’n-Kadîr), headquartering it in Hazaj Tollin. This eased tensions among the [adunai|E] but did little to conciliate the native element. To the Bellanarûd, domination by Nîlûlôni differed little from life under the thumb of Korlea, and Númenor’s overweening pride of race caused the Bellakaze to be gradually stripped of political power, while its increasing decadence and greed crushed the Bellanarûd with taxes and tribute. \n\n[sauroncharacter|E] used these dissensions provoke rebellions among the native population, which required the intervention of [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofelros28').GetFirstNameRegnal] son of [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofelros27').GetFirstNameRegnal], kinsman of Tar-[GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofelros25').GetFirstNameRegnal] the [king|E], who led the [numenorean|E] reprisal against [sauroncharacter|E]’s incursions.

Its great cities were largely leveled, and those parts of the coastal havens that did survive sometimes found they were now some distance from the sea. It is mournfully recalled in Bellakar that “Two thousand years of civilization had been undone in a single day.” Yet it was not quite so. Many survived the cataclysm, and over the coming years their cities were rebuilt, and their harbours restored, albeit with lesser skill than the works of their fathers. Even [GetTitleByKey('d_korlea').GetNameNoTier] was resettled by [faithful|E] [adunai|E]. \n\nLeading this great effort was [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineoftumakvehbelzagar').GetFirstName] of Nîlûlôni, the first man of mixed blood to be lord of that city or head of the Council of Free Cities (the Bâitha’n-Kadîr). Yet the first concern of the Bellakari was the ominous silence from across the sea. No ships came from [numenor|E]. News from [umbar|E] and [anbalkumagan|E] told the same story of devastation, and no word from the homeland. \n\nWhen news finally came, in the spring of the following year, it was brought in ships bearing a strange new sign - a white tree. The ships came from [GetTitleByKey('d_pelargir').GetNameNoTier], and the news was devastating. Númenor was gone.

For the followers of those noble lords had principally settled in the north - in the vales of Baranduin and [anduin|E] - so as to be closer to the [elven|E] kindreds and had long regarded Bellakar as a stronghold of the King's Men due to the dread reputation of [GetTitleByKey('d_korlea').GetNameNoTier]. \n\nBereft of their ancestral homeland and the wellspring of much of their culture, the Bellakari had to forge a new identity as a people, inevitably one more rooted in the diverse traditions of Bellakar. Greater rights were given to the mixed-blood Bellakaze and the native Bellanarûd, and though lordship was often reserved to the [adunai|E] even they were now rarely of truly pure blood.

Therefore, we rejoice in your trust, and lay no claim of lordship upon the men of Bellakar, but only over those of the Westlands who have chosen to submit themselves to our authority.” \n\nThen Elendil removed from his finger a ring and set it in Zagarthôr's hand, saying: “For the aid you have rendered for the sake of the [west|E], now and in battles to come, receive this token of our thanks.

The following centuries would see regular trade between the two Realms-in-Exile, and both of them prospered and thrived.\n\nHowever, this had not resulted in any kind of formal alliance. Despite counting the Bellakaranî as friends, the line of [elendil|E] disapproved of the Tumakveh independence in religious matters, and claimed for themselves and themselves only the right to offer prayer to [eruiluvatar|E] in the name of all [faithful|E]. But growing conflict between Gondor and [umbar|E], and the threat to unobstructed trade that such a conflict represented, eventually increased the willingness of both sides to develop closer ties.\n\nAnd so it was that a young prince of Bellakar came to be sent to Gondor, to become the companion of the crown prince and Captain of the Hosts of Gondor, [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofanarion15').GetFirstName]. The Tumakveh prince's name was Narkuzîr, and in time, he and Tarannon would become very close friends. However, the time [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineoftumakveh15').GetFirstName] spent at the court of [osgiliath|E] left a strong impression upon him, as he came to be convinced that Gondor’s religious practises were indeed superior."

Before he did so, he confided in his friend Tarannon about his plans to reform the [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineoftumakveh14').GetFaith.GetName], the Bellakarean form of worship of [eru|E], which he felt was corrupted by excessive syncretism with Bozishnara cults from the [east|E], like those of the [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineoftumakveh17').GetFaith.GetName] and the [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineoftumakvehtumak').GetFaith.GetName].\n\nThe Kâthasaptha was established by the shrewd first Tumakveh King of Bellakar, [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineoftumakveh1').GetFirstName], himself a descendent of [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineoftumakveh0').GetFirstName], as a compromise solution between the [numenorean|E] worship of [eru|E] and the local customs and beliefs of the Bellanarûd. Ultimately, Narkuzîr wished to ensure a permanent alliance between Bellakar and Gondor by reorganizing the Kâthasaptha to make it fully compatible with the traditional worship of [eruiluvatar|E] as envisioned by the line of [elendil|E].\n\nTarannon reassured his friend that he could count on his help. Once he himself ascended to the throne of Gondor, he would ensure Narkuzîr's reforms would result in the Bellakaranî being considered full equals to the faithful of Gondor and [arnor|E], with Bellakar becoming fully recognised as a third [faithful|E] Realm-in-Exile.

Thankfully, the following outrage was contained by Narkuzîr's talented brother and advisor, [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineoftumakveh16').GetFirstName], but to defuse tensions both brothers had to choose a wife from the ranks of the worshippers of Îshtra, Ladnôca's sister.\n\nDespite being forbidden to do so, the new queen, [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineoftumakveh17').GetFirstName], made sure to secretly educate the daughter she bore Narkuzîr, the princess Barûthhîn, in the worship of Îshtra. When Narkuzîr's old friend [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofanarion15').GetFirstName] became King of [gondor|E], both mother and daughter were dismayed to learn that Barûthhîn was to become Tarannon's wife.\n\nWith Tarannon ruling Gondor, Narkuzîr's plan could finally come to fruition. Renouncing his family's claim to call upon [eruiluvatar|E], he acknowledged the religious leadership of the line of [elendil|E] and abandoned the Kâthasaptha. The prestige of the Tumakveh was greatly tarnished, and Narkuzîr lost the support of his trusted brother, Artârik, who chose exile over accepting the reform. Yet for the moment the king managed to weather the widespread dissent by brandishing the resulting alliance with Gondor as a great achievement."

And, most importantly, the Queen failed to bear Tarannon an heir. Amidst growing suspicion, and under mysterious circumstances, Tarannon eventually set Berúthiel aside, exiled her from Gondor, and left her adrift on a ship, erasing her name from the Book of the Kings.\n\nThe alliance [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineoftumakveh15').GetFirstName] had so longed for was over."

He travelled far to the [east|E], all the way to Khand, and there, found the old homeland of the [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofjoamtuv1').GetCulture.GetName] people. Most of the Tedjin had once migrated to the deserts surrounding Bellakar, and after failing to conquer the Kingdom, they had been subjugated by the Tumakveh.

 explore_history.9008.desc: "While trying to get to grips with the winding history of [middleearth|E], I find a volume dedicated to the Lays of [beleriand|E] - alliterative verse versions of the epic tales of the [firstage|E]. The first few leaves of each poem appear to be well-thumbed, but the pristine condition of later pages show that most readers abandoned them early on. The poems are long, turgid and interminable, so dull that in most cases the author themselves clearly lost interest before completing them. Must I really read these to get a complete understanding of the history of the [elves|E] and Elf-friends?"

 explore_history.9009.desc: "Since the Line of [isildur|E] returned to the Throne of [gondor|E] much has been written of the escapades of the [dunedainnorth|E] during their wilderness years. Though forgotten by most for long centuries, it seems their Rangers were instrumental in keeping the surviving peoples of [eriador|E] free of threats.\n\nYet here in the library I discover a stranger alternate history, seemingly written by a [periannath|E] scholar from The Shire. It claims that the ‘[hobbits|E]’, as they call themselves, had an outsized role in the protection of the North, sending armies to fight for the defence of Fornost, fighting off [orc|E] invaders (while also inventing the game of golf), and having myriad other adventures.\n\nThey even make the strange claim that the true leader of the Rangers of the North was a Hobbit by the farcical name of ‘Trotter’, and rather imply that he should be the One True King."

 explore_history.9010.t: "Round-Earth Society"
 explore_history.9010.desc: "While perusing a semi-abandoned corner of the library I discover a series of periodicals written by a secret-society of [gondorian|E] scholars from the early centuries of the [thirdage|E]. There is much within of considerable interest, for many of the authors were sailors of great experience who had been present during the first circumnavigations of [middleearth|E].\n\nYet among the essays I find a striking claim - that Middle-earth has always been a sphere, and that the legends of a flat earth in earlier Ages of the world were merely [elvish|E] myths not meant to be taken literally. Some of their proofs seem to be contrary to the normal practices of natural philosophy, and doubtless would be ridiculed today."

 explore_history.9011.t: "Mithril Heals Elven Fading?"
 explore_history.9011.desc: "Under a pile of administrative records of little interest, compiling the letters of orders from a book merchant, I find a heavy tome. It is titled 'The Amazing Tale of the Rings of Power' and has been beautifully illustrated and illuminated by master artists.\n\nBut the text itself is of very unequal quality, contradicting itself and established lore many times. Its central thesis is that [sauroncharacter|E] tricked High-King [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineoforodreth4').GetFirstName] into believing the [elves|E] were suffering from some accelerated fading, that only [mithril|El] could cure.\n\nAmong other curious details it has [isildur|E] and [celebrimbor|E] alive simultaneously, a amnesiac Gandalf sent to [middleearth|E] in the [secondage|E], a crackpot theory on buoyancy attributed to [finrod|E], and a hypothetical 'Southlands' collection of human villages in [GetTitleByKey('k_gorgoroth').GetNameNoTier].\n\nI wonder what to do with this."
