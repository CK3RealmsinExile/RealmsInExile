During this time, Valinor was lit by the light of the [twotrees|E] while [middleearth|E] lay in the Great Darkness.\n\nIt was in this age that the [elves|E] awoke and the [valargods|E] waged the Battle of the [powersgods|E], the dark fortress of [utumno|E] was destroyed, and [melkorcharacter|E] was chained within the Halls of [mandoscharacter|E] for three ages of the world.

At this time the [numenoreans|E] achieved the apex of their power and splendour before the world was remade and Númenor cast down in the [akallabeth|E]. 3441 years after it began, the Second Age ended with the defeat of [sauroncharacter|E] in the [warlastalliance|E].\n\nThe scholars in this section are extremely smug at the number of works in their field of study, enough to fill two reading rooms.

 # The Sundering of the Elves

 explore_history.1001.t:0 "The Awakening of the Elves"
 explore_history.1001.desc:0 "On the far eastern shores of the lost Inland Sea of Helcar, in a bay that came to be known as [cuivienen|E], the first [elves|E] awoke from the sleep of [iluvatar|E]. Here they dwelt for a time, happy under the beauty of the stars in heaven and have ever since loved starlight and revered their creator [vardacharactershort|E] above all the [valargods|E].\n\nBefore long, the fledgling elves were discovered by [melkorcharacter|E], who sent his dark agents to watch from the shadows and capture any elf that strayed too far from the Waters of Awakening. These unfortunate souls were imprisoned in the bowels of [utumno|E] and, through slow arts of cruelty were corrupted and bred to form the [orcs|E] in envy and mockery of the Elves.\n\nLater, the Elves were found by the Vala [oromecharactershort|E] in his hunts upon [middleearth|E], and he was seized with a desire to protect them. And so, it came to pass that the [powersgods|E] made war upon Melkor to deliver the Elves from the clutches of evil, forever changing the face of Middle-Earth in the conflict and imprisoning Melkor in the Halls of [mandoscharacter|E] for thousands of years."
 
 explore_history.1001.a:0 "Thank Eru for the protection of the Valar against such terrifying evil!"
 explore_history.1001.b:0 "It is right that Melkor was judged for his ill-deeds."

 explore_history.1002.desc:0 "With [melkorcharacter|E] humbled and in chains, [oromecharactershort|E] came again to the [elves|E], and passionately called them to follow him to [valinor|E], promising them safety, tutelage, and light. The Elves sent three ambassadors from among them to travel to Valinor and speak for their people: Ingwë, Finwë, and Elwë.\n\nReturning from Valinor, they were so filled with awe by the glory and majesty of the [valargods|E] and the splendour of the light of the [twotrees|E] that they urged their people to heed the summons of the Valar and make the long journey west to Valinor.\n\nThus, befell the First Sundering of the Elves. For while the kindred of Ingwë and some of the kindreds of Finwë and Elwë were willing to follow Oromë, there were many still that refused the call to leave the lands of their birth, as they loved [middleearth|E] and the starlight above the unknown West and rumours of its burning light. These Elves became known as the Avari, the Unwilling, and would not meet their kindred again until many ages were past."
 
 explore_history.1002.a:0 "A tragic parting, but the Eldar were right to journey West."
 explore_history.1002.b:0 "After seeing nothing but wrath and deception from the Ainur, who can blame the Avari?"

 explore_history.1003.t:0 "The Vanyar"
 explore_history.1003.desc:0 "Once the [elves|E] who answered the summons of the [valargods|E] set out on the [greatjourney|E], they were further split into three groups. The smallest of these groups was led by Ingwë and were the most anxious to reach [valinor|E].\n\nThe [vanyarelves|E] led the way, pushing ever westward at a great pace, becoming the first to reach the shores of the vast [belegaer_sea|E]. It was here that the Vala [ulmocharacter|E] uprooted the large island known as [toleressea|E] from the middle of the ocean and, with the help of his servants, used it to ferry the Vanyar from the shore and across the waves to the land of Valinor. For his haste and his zeal, Ingwë was crowned High-King of all the Elves.\n\nThe Vanyar loved the Valar and the light of Valinor above all else, choosing never to return to [middleearth|E], save to fight in the War of Wrath in the final overthrow of [melkorcharacter|E] at the end of the [firstage|E]."
 
 explore_history.1003.a:0 "Such devotion and unwavering dedication to a single cause is inspiring."
 explore_history.1003.b:0 "Who can blame them? I'd have been on the first boat to Valinor too!"

 explore_history.1004.desc:0 "The next to arrive were the [elves|E] known as the [noldorelves|E], led by Finwë, making good time but not bearing the same burning determination of the [vanyarelves|E]. When they arrived in [valinor|E] they built the city of Tirion upon the green hill of Túna with the help of the Vanyar in the gap of the Pelóri Mountains, and it was here that Finwë ruled over his people.\n\nThe Ñoldor are accounted as the most skilled among all the Elves in lore and smithing, the greatest among them being Finwë's son Fëanor, creator of the famed [silmarils|E]. Many Ñoldor would eventually return to [middleearth|E] to fight against Melkor and form the most well-known of the great Elven kingdoms."
 
 explore_history.1004.a:0 "The Ñoldor's mastery of craftsmanship is amazing, they have Aulë's blessing!"
 explore_history.1004.b:0 "Those gems caused more trouble than they were worth... what folly!"

 explore_history.1005.t:0 "The Teleri"
 explore_history.1005.desc:0 "Finally, came the [elves|E] known as the [telerielves|E] led by the brothers Olwë and Elwë and largest of the three kindreds who set out on [greatjourney|El]. Unlike their [vanyarelves|E] and [noldorelves|E] brethren, the Teleri were a diverse group with great portions of their disunited host settling along the way without ever making it to [valinor|E].\n\nIn the woods of [rhovanion|E] the [silvanelves|E] and Nandor settled while the Green-Elves settled the forests of Ossiriand and the [eredluin|E]. The [sindarelves|E] made their home in Doriath after tarrying there to try to find their leader Elwë, who had become enraptured with the [maiagod|E] [meliancharacter|E]. Last were the [falathrim|E] who settled the coasts of [beleriand|E], taking Nowë (in later years known as Cirdan) as their lord.\n\nFinally, those remaining few that completed the Great Journey to Valinor under the leadership of Olwë founded the city of Alqualondë, the Haven of the Swans, and became known as the [falmarielves|E]."
 
 explore_history.1005.a:0 "A lesson in perseverance, and the rewards of seeing things through to the end."
 explore_history.1005.b:0 "Why rush to Valinor when there is so much wonder in Middle-Earth!"
 explore_history.1005.c:0 "These Teleri must have been harder to herd than cats! And how can you just... lose a king?"

She bore him a son, whom she called [feanor|E], Spirit of Fire. But Míriel said to Finwë: "Never again shall I bear a son, for the strength that would have nourished many has gone forth into Fëanor". After which she departed to rest in the gardens of [loriencharacter|E], never to wake again.\n\nFinwë grieved much for the departure of his wife, and all his love he gave to his son. Fëanor grew fast and strong, subtle in mind and skilled in hand, the greatest in mind and body of the Children of [iluvatar|E]. He devised the [tengwar|E] which Men and [elves|E] use to this day to write their speech, marvellous gems and seeing-stones that are called [palantir|E].\n\nEarly in life Fëanor wedded Nerdanel, daughter of Mahtan, a smith beloved of [aulecharacter|E], who taught much to his son-in-law. Nerdanel was wise and patient, and alone was she able to sway Fëanor's counsel, at times. Together they sired seven [sonsoffeanorshort|E]."

And to Fingolfin it was told to be wary of his brother, lest he should use their father’s love towards him to strip him of everything. And so, Fingolfin came to Finwë to ask him to restrain Fëanor, disparaging his loyalty to their father; at this insult, Fëanor entered the court and pulled his sword on Fingolfin, warning him that it would prove sharper than Fingolfin's tongue.\n\nThus, the Valar finally uncovered that Morgoth was the root of the disquiet of the Ñoldor, and he fled before their pursuit. But for drawing his sword upon his brother, Fëanor was exiled from Tirion for twelve years, and with him to Formenos came his father and the [elves|E] of his house. For Finwë held himself unkinged, for the Valar had unilaterally overruled him, and in that moment the lies of Morgoth seemed to Fëanor as truth for Fingolfin reigned in Tirion as regent, and it was the Valar whose actions made it so.\n\nAt the end of his exile, Fëanor was invited to a great feast in Valimar, and near all the Elves of Aman were present, and the brothers reconciled.

However, this enriching of Korlea reduced the annual tribute reaching [numenor|E], resulting in the southern colonies being centralised under a new regime ruling from [anbalkumagan|E]. \n\nThe new lord of Anbalukkhôr, Azrubên of Rómenna, rolled back Korlean privileges to gain support in the rest of Bellakar, and reformed the Council of Free Cities (the Bâitha’n-Kadîr), headquartering it in Hazaj Tollin. This eased tensions among the Adûnâi but did little to conciliate the native element. To the Bellanarod, domination by Nîlûlôni differed little from life under the thumb of Korlea, and Númenor’s overweening pride of race caused the Bellakaze to be gradually stripped of political power, while its increasing decadence and greed crushed the Bellanarod with taxes and tribute. \n\nSauron used these dissensions provoke rebellions among the native population, which required the intervention of Pharazôn son of Gimilkhâd, kinsman of Tar-Palantir the [king|E], who led the [numenorean|E] reprisal against [sauroncharacter|E]’s incursions.

However, some of the more practical-minded citizens of Nîlûlôni, Hazaj Tollin and Narîk-Zadan sought to avoid further rebellion among the Bellakaranî, and granted them protection.\n\nThe city of Korlea, on the other hand, embraced the cult of Mulkhêr as its official religion. A temple to Mulkhêr was erected in Korlea in imitation of the one that now stood in the midst of [armenelos|E], and Ar-Pharazon incited the citizenry to impose the cult on the rest of Bellakar by any means. The conflict that ensued would decide the future of Bellakar. \n\nBelzagar of Nîlûlôni solicited the aid of the native population, and by yoking their strength the tide rapidly turned against Korlea.

 explore_history.3021.desc:0 "The earthquakes and great wave that marked the [downfallofnumenor|E] wrought unimaginable havoc on [bellakar|E]. Its great cities were largely leveled, and those parts of the coastal havens that did survive sometimes found that were now some distance from the sea. It is mournfully recalled in Bellakar that “Two thousand years of civilization had been undone in a single day.” Yet it was not quite so. Many survived the cataclysm, and over the coming years their cities were rebuilt, and their harbours restored, albeit with lesser skill than the works of their fathers. Even Korlea was resettled by [faithfulshort|E] Adûnâi. \n\nLeading this great effort was Belzagar of Nîlûlôni, the first man of mixed blood to be lord of that city or head of the Council of Free Cities (the Bâitha’n-Kadîr). Yet the first concern of the Bellakari was the ominous silence from across the sea. No ships came from [numenor|E]. News from [umbar|E] and [anbalkumagan|E] told the same story of devastation, and no word from the homeland. \n\nWhen news finally came, in the spring of the following year, it was brought in ships bearing a strange new sign - a white tree. The ships came from Pelargir, and the news was devastating. Númenor was gone. Ar-Pharazon’s folly had doomed it. Both he and [sauronthedarklordcharacter|E] [sauroncharacter|E] had been destroyed.

For the followers of those noble lords had principally settled in the north - in the vales of Baranduin and [anduin|E] - so as to be closer to the elven kindreds and had long regarded Bellakar as a stronghold of the King’s Men due to the dread reputation of Korlea. \n\nBereft of their ancestral homeland and the wellspring of much of their culture, the Bellakari had to forge a new identity as a people, inevitably one more rooted in the diverse traditions of Bellakar. Greater rights were given to the mixed-blood Bellakaze and the native Bellanarod, and though lordship was often reserved to the Adûnâi even they were now rarely of truly pure blood.

Recalling the evil done by Sauron, they chose the former. In 3429 S.A.

You are lord of the Elendili, not of [bellakar|E].” \n\nIn response, Elendil addressed Zagarthôr of Nîlûlôni in the hearing of all the allies as ‘Macilion of Silmalondë’, thereby acknowledging the Bellakari to be among the Faithful, not descendants of the [kingsmen|E], saying “We did not know, cast upon the shores of this [middleearth|E], that there were others who held true to the allegiance of our forefathers. Therefore, we rejoice in your trust, and lay no claim of lordship upon the men of Bellakar, but only over those of the Westlands who have chosen to submit themselves to our authority.” \n\nThen Elendil removed from his finger a ring and set it in Zagarthôr’s hand, saying: “For the aid you have rendered for the sake of the West, now and in battles to come, receive this token of our thanks. And if a day should come when the brood of Black Númenor rises again to trouble your people, your descendants shall show this ring to mine and say: ‘Macilion of Silmalondë bids you repay the debt of Elendil.’ Then they shall bleed for you as you have bled for us."

But growing conflict between Gondor and [umbar|E], and the threat to unobstructed trade that such a conflict represented, eventually increased the willingness of both sides to develop closer ties.\n\nAnd so it was that a young prince of Bellakar came to be sent to Gondor, to become the companion of the crown prince and Captain of the Hosts of Gondor, Tarannon. The Tumakveh prince’s name was Narkuzîr, and in time, he and Tarannon would become very close friends.

Ultimately, Narkuzîr wished to ensure a permanent alliance between Bellakar and Gondor by reorganizing the Kâthasaptha to make it fully compatible with the traditional worship of [eruiluvatar|E] as envisioned by the line of [elendil|E].\n\nTarannon reassured his friend that he could count on his help. Once he himself ascended to the throne of Gondor, he would ensure Narkuzîr’s reforms would result in the Bellakaranî being considered full equals to the faithful of Gondor and [arnor|E], with Bellakar becoming fully recognised as a third Faithful Realm-in-Exile.

Thankfully, the following outrage was contained by Narkuzîr’s talented brother and advisor, Artârik, but to defuse tensions both brothers had to choose a wife from the ranks of the worshippers of Îshtra, Ladnoca’s sister.\n\nDespite being forbidden to do so, the new queen, Zâirinzil, made sure to secretly educate the daughter she bore Narkuzîr, the princess Barûthhîn, in the worship of Îshtra. When Narkuzîr’s old friend Tarannon became King of [gondor|E], both mother and daughter were dismayed to learn that Barûthhîn was to become Tarannon’s wife.\n\nWith Tarannon ruling Gondor, Narkuzîr’s plan could finally come to fruition. Renouncing his family’s claim to call upon [eruiluvatar|E], he acknowledged the religious leadership of the line of [elendil|E] and abandoned the Kâthasaptha. The prestige of the Tumakveh was greatly tarnished, and Narkuzîr lost the support of his trusted brother, Artârik, who chose exile over accepting the reform.

And, most importantly, the Queen failed to bear Tarannon an heir. Amidst growing suspicion, and under mysterious circumstances, Tarannon eventually set Berúthiel aside, exiled her from Gondor, and left her adrift on a ship, erasing her name from the Book of the Kings.\n\nThe alliance Narkuzîr had so longed for was over."

But with his life’s work in shambles, Narkuzîr was deeply dismayed.\n\nWith his people still greatly upset by his reforms and deprived of his ally, the King only owed what little prestige he had left to a great victory he won over the Qarsag, invaders from the East who sought to take advantage of Bellakar’s lack of stability. However, Bellakar was still imbued with the strength of centuries of unparalleled prosperity, and the invasion was crushed. Narkuzîr managed to reconcile with his brother, Artârik, whose assistance on the battlefield helped achieve victory.\n\nJust a week later, Narkuzîr stepped down as King of Bellakar, abdicating in favor of his brother.

 # The Tedjin Conquest and Occupation of Bellakar by Voskey

 explore_history.4021.desc:0 "Under the rule of Tarannon Falastur, the first of the [shipkings|E] of [gondor|E], the ancient haven of [umbar|E] gradually lost its hold on trade through Belegaer and became a target for [gondorian|E] expansion. One of the Umbarean nobles in the Council of Captains, Zagarkhâd, a worshipper of the Shadow, had the insight to understand that Umbar’s position, between Gondor and [bellakar|E], made it vulnerable so long as both of these great realms endured. But he also understood that Umbar couldn’t intervene against one without inviting retaliation from the other.\n\nTherefore, Zagarkhâd left Umbar, determined to secure its future through other means, in secret. He travelled far to the East, all the way to Khand, and there, found the old homeland of the Tedjin people. Most of the Tedjin had once migrated to the deserts surrounding Bellakar, and after failing to conquer the Kingdom, they had been subjugated by the Tumakveh. Zagarkhâd thought to use the remaining Tedjin of Khand, a warlike people fully devoted to the [sauronthedarklordcharacter|E], to radicalize the Tedjin of Bellakar and incite them to invade the Realm-in-Exile once more. He and his new allies spent years befriending, converting and training the Tedjin clans near Bellakar, unbeknownst to the Tumakveh."

The old King Artârik was slow to react, and disagreements between himself and his prominent nephew, Êruzagar the Warmaker, didn’t help matters, as the Tedjin, thanks to Zagarkhâd’s influence, had a good grasp on battlefield tactics and strategy.\n\nThings came to a head when the two armies met near the old haven of Hazaj Tollin. There, under the bold leadership of the chieftain Joam-Tuv, the Tedjin crushed and slaughtered the forces of Bellakar. Zagarkhâd died during the battle, and so did King Artârik, alongside most of the old Bellakarian nobility, thinning the [numenorean|E] bloodlines even further. The blood-soaked battlefield came to be called Zayan an-Âgan, the Field of the Black Death, and forever remained a sinister place. \n\nThe new King, Êruzagar, successfully defended the Bellakarian capital, Nîlûlondê, for five years. Alas, eventually, a traitor opened the gates to the Tedjin. The King managed to get his son, Adûnuzîr, to escape the city in secret and get to safety; but Nîlûlondê’s doom had come. The Bellakarians fought fiercely, the King himself slaying two of Joam-Tuv’s sons ; but it was all for naught. Captured alive, the King was fed to Joam-Tuv’s dogs. Tedjin rule over Bellakar had begun."

While Joam-Tuv was chosen as the first Kataj of Bellakar, in the North, the religious leader Imrathôr, Izindubêth of the Batân an-Izindi, from his fortified monastery of Urud an-Khibil, called for a crusade against the invading Tedjin. His warriors, the Narduwî am-Batân, were mostly comprised of ordinary country folk making great use of hit-and-run tactics and their knowledge of the terrain.\n\nBut eventually, Tedjin numerical superiority prevailed. The Narduwî am-Batân were pushed all the way back to Urud an-Khibil, which was then besieged, stormed, and destroyed, its defenders massacred. Even the very monastery itself was demolished, the stones used to built the great fortress of Joam, which Joam-Tuv chose as his capital. Tedjin domination expanded to Mardrûak and the Felaya, and the Tedjin started calling the whole area Qadjajar, meaning « Land of Warriors ». \n\nAnd so, the Tedjin yoke fell upon Bellakar, although its people were preserved, since the Tedjin, being nomads, knew little of agriculture or administration, and relied upon their subjects to provide for them. Over time, intermarriages between the conquerors and the conquered in Mardrûak and the northern Felaya led to a whole new people emerging: the Sôriya."

 explore_history.4024.desc:0 "But there was still hope for the Tumakveh, for Adûnuzîr, son of Êruzagar, had successfully found refuge on the Forest Coast, between southern Bellakar and Rây. For decades, he bided his time, waiting for the Tedjin to lower their guard. When an oppurtunity finally presented itself, Adûnuzîr, supported by the pragmatic rulers of Rây who saw a Tumakveh restoration as serving their own interests, quickly reconquered most of the cities of Southern [bellakar|E] in rapid succession, and was crowned King of Bellakar in Korlea.\n\nThanks to the skill of the warriors sent by his Bozishnara allies, Adûnuzîr successfully led Joam-Tuv and his army into a trap, and slew the Kataj himself. Even Nîlûlondê was retaken, although the city remained in ruins. The King’s son, Prince Arphazân, assembled a fleet and retook the old haven of Ûrêzâyan, leaving the Qadjajar open to invasion.\n\nHowever, the Bozishnara allies of the King, deeming their contribution sufficient, returned to Rây, and the King still lacked the strength to bring the war to Qadjajar. This, coupled with Tedjin instability following the death of Joam-Tuv meant a stalemate developed, only troubled by naval raids lauched by the Sôriya of Mardrûak, who had grown to become skillful mariners."

Both [bellakar|E] and the Qadjajar mustered their troops to take advantage of the opportunity, and the newly crowned King Arphazân won a great victory, killing the new Kataj, Joam-Kator; but he failed to gather momentum, and the campaign to reconquer the Felaya stalled.\n\nSalvation for the Tumakveh, ironically, would come from [umbar|E]. The haven had recently been conquered by the [shipkings|E] at last. Nûluzîr, son of Zagarkhâd, remembering his father’s puppets, began subverting the rule of Ogtaï the new Kataj, to try and recruit his men as mercenaries to retake Umbar. Ogtaï reacted with fury, beginning a terror campaign in Mardrûak against all those who would listen to Nûluzîr, in turn alienating the local Mardrukans, the Sôriya, and even his own people.\n\nAnd so it came to be that the leaders of Mardrûak turned on Ogtaï and sent a secret embassy to King Arphazân, sealing an alliance with him. When the King launched his attack, many of Ogtaï’s people turned against him, and he couldn’t mount a significant resistance. Besieged in Joam, the Kataj accepted Arphazân’s offer to meet him in single combat. When the King slew him, after a legendary duel, the Qadjajar fell with him, and Tedjin rule over Bellakar ended once and for all."

It was he who built the pillars of the Argonath around the falls of Rauros, and took many of the proud and fair [northmen|E] in his service in order to bolster Gondor's strength.\n\nTo secure his northern flank, the King sent his son and heir Valacar as ambassador to the Northmen and their leader: Vidugavia, king of [rhovanion|E]. His mission was to learn the language and the ways of this people, far-off kin of the [dunedain|E] through the House of Hador.\n\nBut the Prince became so enamoured with the plains of the North and its people that he decided to wed Vidugavia's daughter: Vidumavi. Though he disapproved of this choice, and shared the fears of many of Gondor's nobility that Valacar's offspring should prove as short-lived as their mother, Romendacil allowed the marriage of his son."

Under his rule the realm knew peace, and the crown prince showed no sign of aging faster than the [dunedain|E] of the royal house.\n\nBut as the King grew old, rebellion began to smoulder in the southern fiefs, where the men of [numenorean|E] descent chafed at the idea of being ruled by a man of mingled blood. The loudest voice raised in protest was that of a second cousin of the King: Castamir, Captain of the Ships and as such ruler of the great port of Pelargir."

He used his power to suppress opposition inside [gondor|E] and outside its borders: men of Northman or Haradrim descent suffered great sorrows under his rule.\n\nAfter ten years in exile, Eldacar had gathered in [rhovanion|E] a great force of [northmen|E] and northern [dunedain|E], willing to fight to restore their rightful King to the throne.

 explore_history.9004.desc:0 "I have encountered numerous challenging volumes in the library, many written by ageing [dunedain|E] scholars obsessing with mortality and its limits, but few are as esoteric as the tome now before me. The author makes a bold claim: that one feature of the Gift of [conceptracemen|E] is something called ‘preincarnation’, the ability of Men to inhabit the minds of earlier incarnations of themselves, and thereby effectively travel through time.\n\nThey go on to argue that [elendil|E] himself was ‘visited’ by a far-future incarnation of himself called Eädwine from a city of scholars called Mondósar. It’s an entertaining tale, but I’m really not sure what to make of it."

 explore_history.9005.desc:0 "The [orcs|E] remain among the most dangerous of the perennial plagues threatening [middleearth|E]. Yet their history is not something I have ever given much thought to. And so my interest is piqued when I spot a leather-bound tome on a high shelf entitled ‘Ruined and Broken: A Brief History of the Yrch’. To my frustration the book is neither brief nor a history. Instead it provides speculation after speculation on the origin of the Orcs.\n\nCould they have been bred by [melkorcharacter|E] from subterranean heats and slime? Perhaps they were made in mockery of the Firstborn? Or were they even made from captured [elves|E] by slow arts of cruelty and wickedness? No, perhaps they are mere automata, driven by the wills of Melkor and [sauroncharacter|E]? Oh wait, they are actually corrupted [conceptracemen|E], probably Drúedain reduced to bestial primitivism by the breeding programme of the Enemy. Or are they a mix of all the above, refined by Sauron, with their upper echelons perhaps being corrupted [maiargods|E]?\n\nIt goes on and on without conclusion."

I am delighted to find a scholarly work on her life and that of her noble husband, Celeborn, and sit down to read it.\n\nYet I am quickly disappointed. The scholarship is extremely sloppy, marred by contradictions in the timeline and even basic facts. When did Galadriel leave [valinor|E]? Was Celeborn born in Doriath or Valinor? What was Galadriel’s role in [eregion|E]? Exactly how many times did they move to and from Lorien? Was the elvenking Amroth their son? Who in [eru|E]’s name is ‘Teleporno’?\n\nRather than a single narrative underpinned with clear evidence, the book presents various contradictory versions. Worse, as the work enters its final stages it appears that the author has become somewhat smitten by his subject, increasingly presenting Galadriel as some sort of flawless martyr of impeccable judgement."

The tract contains a baffling but densely-argued proposition - that everything we believe about [middleearth|E] south of [umbar|E] is a lie.\n\nThis lie is an elaborate fairy-tale spun by the sailors of the [belegaer_sea|E] in order to justify their high fees and expenses. In reality, Merpimir claims, the maps of southern Middle-Earth are fabrications unsupported by the strong evidence underpinning the cartography of more northerly lands. [bellakar|E] is singled out as being a totally invented place, with sources marshalled to argue that if there were ever colonialists from [westernesse|E] south of Umbar they would all have been of the Black [numenorean|E] variety."

The first few leaves of each poem appear to be well-thumbed, but the pristine condition of later pages show that most readers abandoned them early on.

It claims that the ‘[hobbits|E]’, as they call themselves, had an outsized role in the protection of the North, sending armies to fight for the defence of Fornost, fighting off [orc|E] invaders (while also inventing the game of golf), and having myriad other adventures.\n\nThey even make the strange claim that the true leader of the Rangers of the North was a hobbit by the farcical name of ‘Trotter’, and rather imply that he should be the One True King."

There is much within of considerable interest, for many of the authors were sailors of great experience who had been present during the first circumnavigations of [middleearth|E].\n\nYet among the essays I find a striking claim - that Middle-earth has always been a sphere, and that the legends of a flat earth in earlier ages of the world were merely Elvish myths not meant to be taken literally. Some of their proofs seem to be contrary to the normal practices of natural philosophy, and doubtless would be ridiculed today."

Its central thesis is that [sauroncharacter|E] tricked High-King Gil-galad into believing the [elves|E] were suffering from some accelerated fading, that only [mithril|El] could cure.\n\nAmong other curious details it has [isildur|E] and [celebrimbor|E] alive simultaneously, a amnesiac Gandalf sent to [middleearth|E] in the [secondage|E], a crackpot theory on buoyancy attributed to Finrod, and a hypothetical "Southlands" collection of human villages in Gorgoroth.\n\nI wonder what to do with this."
