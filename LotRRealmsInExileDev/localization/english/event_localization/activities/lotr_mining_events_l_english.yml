So it wasn't a shock that my mind began to trail off while I was wandering down a cavern. An unfortunate circumstance that led me to completely forget to mark the way I had come from. My thought continues to trail off until I spot a faint glimmer ahead of me. With my curiosity piqued, I march forward until that glimmer expans and consumes the entire room. After a momentary blindness my eyes widen as my eyes fully comprehend just what it was I was seeing.\n\nThe chamber is utterly filled with precious gems. Rubies burned like red hot suns, sapphires glowed like the moon in the sky, and diamonds twinkled like stars above. Combined with the multitude of enormous stalagtites and stalagmites which stand as evidence of the virgin state of this chamber I'm filled with a childlike glee at the prospective wealth in this cavern.\n\nThe only problem was how I got here. I had practically dozed off during the stroll and had no real indication of how to find my way back. I could always call for help, but I'd likely have to abandon the chamber to get to a spot where the expedition would hear my calls. Alternatively, I could try to trace my steps back to my companions, though that ran the risk of me getting even more lost in the caverns."

Soon, I recognize familiar rock formations, and ahead, voices and more lights become audible. A sigh of relief escapes me as I hurry forward.\n\nMy companions had started to worry about me, but fortunately, I hadn't been gone long enough for them to abandon their work. Moreover, when I describe the beautiful chamber I've discovered, they eagerly agree to follow me. Once again, I retrace my steps back to the chamber, ready for us to begin excavating."

Desperately, I backtrack to try another route, convinced I must have been this way before. However, I only find myself navigating darker passages. To make matters worse, my torch quickly runs out of fuel, plunging me into darkness. With no other recourse, I begin to shout for help, hoping someone will hear.\n\nHours turned to days. Hunger gnaws at my stomach, dehydration cracks my lips, and my throat grows hoarse from shouting. Finally, I slump against a rock, resigned to my fate, and draw a breath that threatened to be among my last. But just as despair threatens to overwhelm me, I hear voices echoing through the halls, accompanied by a glimmer of light around a corner. Summoning the last of my strength, I quickly rush to it, yelling again I see the companions I had come on this expedition with. I was finally safe.\n\nAfter I was readjusted to the light and finally got some food in my stomach I learned that my party lost a lot of time in their attempts to find me, wasting quite a bit of time that could have been used mining. This combined with me having no idea how to get back to that beautiful chamber was sure to put a damper on our expedition."

There, amidst the ancient stones and shadows, we find it – [mithril|E]! Its shimmering surface, akin to moonlight caught in solid form, adorns the walls like the armor of the Valar themselves. A metal of such rare beauty and strength that all can scarce believe their eyes."
 mining.8001.desc.gold:0 "As we toil beneath the rocky embrace of the mountains, the earth yields up one of its most coveted treasures – Gold! Gleaming like the first rays of dawn upon a still lake, the veins of this lustrous metal dance through the dark stone like a hidden river of wealth. With each strike of the pickaxe, we unearth more of this gilded bounty, and our hearts sing with the promise of riches untold."

The depths of this ancient realm have yielded a veritable treasure trove of material, their brilliance rivaled only by the gleam in my miners' eyes.\n\nThe riches flowing forth from these great caverns have more than compensated for the expenses incurred, filling my coffers to overflowing. This venture shall be recounted as a shining testament to the fortune that smiles upon the venturesome, and my house shall bask in the glow of unparalleled success."
 mining.8003.t.3:0 "A Healthy Bounty"
 mining.8003.desc.3:0 "Amidst the echoing expanse of the sprawling mines, I find myself in a state of measured satisfaction as I appraise the results of my mining expedition. While not an overwhelming success, our efforts have borne fruit, yielding a respectable cache of material. The costs incurred in the venture have been covered, with a modest surplus to my name.\n\nIt is a satisfactory outcome, though not one that will have bards composing epic ballads in our honor. In the depths of the earth, where fortune is often as capricious as the shifting shadows, I have found a measure of prosperity."
 mining.8003.t.1:0 "A Modest Success"
 mining.8003.desc.1:0 "In the shadowed recesses of the cavernous mines, I stand with a hint of resignation as I survey the outcome of my mining expedition. Though not a complete disappointment, our endeavors have yielded only a modest amount of material.\n\nThe meager returns barely cover the expenses incurred in my venture, leaving little to celebrate. In the labyrinthine depths of these ancient caverns, fortune has proven elusive, and my gains remain but a faint glimmer in the dark."
 mining.8003.a:0 "Let's finish packing and head home!"

 mining.8004.t.5:0 "Total Failure"
 mining.8004.desc.5:0 "As the last of my team wearily steps out of the mine, I look upon the paltry haul of my ill-fated expedition. A heavy heart weighs upon me, for this venture has proven naught but a dire folly. Those echoing chambers yielded not the treasures I sought, but instead swallowed my fortune and ambition whole.\n\nOur pickaxes, once wielded with hopeful vigor, have grown heavy with futility, as the riches we had dreamed of remain locked in the unyielding grasp of the earth. The coffers of my house, now bereft of wealth, mockingly reflect the dimming embers of my once-proud dreams, and I, the noble leader, must bear the weight of our costly misadventure."
 mining.8004.t.3:0 "A Lackluster Yield"
 mining.8004.desc.3:0 "As I stand amidst the dimly lit tunnels of the mines, a heavy sigh escapes my lips, and my brow furrows in disappointment. My mining expedition, while not an unmitigated disaster, has proven to be a middling endeavor at best. The riches that we had hoped to uncover were scarce, and the costs incurred in setting up our operations far exceeded the modest gains.\n\nMy coffers are not entirely emptied, but they are far from brimming with the riches I had envisioned. It is a somber reckoning, a reminder that the whims of fate do not always favor the venturesome."
 mining.8004.t.1:0 "A Mild Disappointment"
 mining.8004.desc.1:0 "Amidst the echoing chambers of the mines, I find myself grappling with a sense of mild vexation as I assess the outcome of my mining expedition. While not an unequivocal triumph, it would be an exaggeration to label it a failure of great magnitude. My miners, with their unwavering determination, did manage to unearth some modest caches, enough to recoup a portion of my investment, though not as abundant as my initial hopes had suggested.\n\nThe cost of the expedition remains a burden, yet it is one I can bear without grave consequences. In this venture, I have learned that the depths of the earth are as capricious as they are mysterious, sometimes yielding treasures in moderation."
