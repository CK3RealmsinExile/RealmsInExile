 hunt.4020.desc:0 "Under the canopy of the forests, I track a stag. An exceptionally large specimen, it has been on the move for a while now, yet I can feel myself getting closer by the second. As I peer over one particularly gnarly root that blocked by vision from the rest of the tracks, I notice something; blood, signs of a scuffle, and then the unmistakable tracks of an Ungol dragging away a carcass. \n\nCurses! Such evil has become far more common in Mirkwood of late, ever since the Necromancer first nested in Dol Goldur. I cannot let such a creature live, and so I begin to track it, gathering up my fellow hunters. \n\nAfter many hours, I finally come across it's den. It did not bother over-much to hide it's tracks; carelessly dragging it's meal back to it's nest. It must've been a young one, then; not yet clever enough to understand that it is not the apex predator of this land. And with this, it has endangered it's entire nest. \n\nMy fellow hunters take up positions around the nest, and as the Great Spiders within quibble and quarrel over the stags corpse. Raising up a hand, I wait for the perfect moment..."

 hunt.4021.t:0 "Triumph over the spiders"
 hunt.4021.desc:0 "Our arrows fly true. Feathering the vile creatures, they swiftly fall before our wrath. Those who survive the first volley panic, and many attempt to flee. Yet our eyes are keen, and our arrow-heads keener still. They whistle as they soar, and the spiders screech as they are slain. \n\nOur hearts are filled with much sorrow after the killing; for among the wrapped up remains of animals are the unmistakable forms of Edain. And perhaps even Edhil. \n\nWe take these bodies in order to give them proper funerals; whilst we may not know who they once were, very few indeed deserve to be left to rot in the destroyed nest of the foul Ungol. \n\nFurther into the nest, we spy a chest; wrapped with stray spider-webs, we uncover it before breaking it open. Within, a dusty fortune of gold is found. \n\nGathering up the bodies of the dead and this new-found treasure, we return. Much sorrow has been found here today, but at least these Spiders shall not harm another."

 hunt.4022.t:0 "Defeated by the spiders"
 hunt.4022.desc:0 "Our arrows fly true. The spiders screech and wail as they are feathered with our barrage, and many fall in twitching heaps. Yet many still survived, and with a great chattering cry they charge forward. \n\nWe engage in combat with these creatures, and whilst many of the foul Spiders fall beneath our blades and bows, their numbers do not seem to dwindle. Before long, we are slowly pushed back. Further and further away from the nest, evidently much larger than we had thought. \n\nI hear a sharp cry of pain from beside me, and decide enough is enough once I see one of our own being dragged down and slain. Calling for a retreat, we flee into the forests. \n\nWhilst the Ungol pursue us for a while, they eventually give up on the chase; they do not much care to hunt fleeing prey that can still kill so many of them. \n\nWe return to the hunt wounded and aching from loss. Such foolishness to charge in..."

 hunt.4024.desc:0 "As we traverse the forest trails of our hunting grounds, I notice something on the edge of my hearing. Lifting up a hand, our entourage halts. We hear the sound of distant musical laughter and merry-making. And in it, we hear our tongue being spoken. \n\nLowering our weapons, I look around before deciding whether to greet these people, or to leave them be..."

 hunt.4025.desc:0 "Deciding to go meet with these people, we move through the woods towards them. At the edge of their camp, we call out in the same tongue so they know we're here. Although some look startled, others look happy to receive guests. \n\nI sit by the leader of this group, and speak to them. Apparently, they're also a hunting group; and are celebrating having slain some Orc filth not too long ago. They apologize for not noticing us earlier, saying that the drink had lessened their senses. \n\nOur two groups spend a good while together, laughing and drinking. We compare our kills, and our prowess. We tell each other stories, and sing long into the night. \n\nBut before long, it is time to part. I bid farewell to the other hunting parties' leader, before slinging my bow and returning to the trail."

 hunt.4026.t:0 "You encounter a Huorn"
 hunt.4026.desc:0 "After a long, tiring day of hunting, we decide to set up camp. Picking out a peaceful seeming glade, we swiftly set up sentry postings and prepare to rest for the night. \n\nEntering a meditative trance, I while away the hours to day-light and slowly recover my strength. Yet in the midst of the night, I hear something. Snapping out of my trance, I perk an ear; the shuffling of dirt, and a wooden creaking... \n\nToo late do I realize our predicament. We have already been entangled in the roots of the Huorn. And these are not the Huorns of Fangorn; oh no, these are the Black Huorns of Mirkwood. Twisted, dark creatures with an appetite for killing. \n\nDespite this, I might be able to reason with them; for whilst even regular Huorns can be malicious, we Eldar have a long history with these kin of the Ents. Yet perhaps I dare not take that risk, and instead try to carve my way out. Elvish strength might win the day, for the roots entangling me have not yet fully ensnared me..."

 hunt.4027.desc:0 "Diplomacy is the best way out of this situation. For whilst Black Huorns are fell creatures, they were once Huorns, and so I should at least try to resolve this without further violence. \n\nI speak in a low, rhythmic tone; almost like a song. I weave a story; my story, of why we are in the woods, where we have been, what we have done. I speak of our kills, and our failures, and the dangers we have faced. As if lulling a child to sleep, my voice slowly causes the Huorn to retract it's roots. \n\nBy the end of my tale, the Black Huorn has returned to slumber. My fellows are all understandably shaken at such a close call; being crushed to death by a Huorn is a most unpleasant fate. One I would wish to avoid. \n\nWith our rest thoroughly disturbed, we pack up and move on. Hopefully, the next tree we rest at won't be plotting to kill us..."

 hunt.4028.t:0 "The Huorn takes one of your party"
 hunt.4028.desc:0 "I decide that attempting to reason with the Huorn is the best course of action to take. For the Huorns are kin of the Ents; and the Ents learnt the gift of speech from the Eldar. It is only fitting, then, that I should try to calm this creature with something similar? \n\nI begin to speak. I speak of our hunting trip, of what we have faced, what we have seen. I speak of much. Yet it seems for naught, as the Hourn's roots keep tightening. I continue my tales, voice becoming increasingly strained and desperate until, suddenly, all the pressure halts. \n\nYet not for one of our hunters. Slowly, they are dragged under the dirt. Sorrow tinges my voice, and for a moment the Huorn's roots seem to loosen. Then, and only then, does the Huorn let us go. \n\nWe stumble away from the foul tree; wounded and winded, and down a member. We shall return to end this foul creature, but we must first tend to our wounds. As we leave, bitter tears fall from the eyes of my fellows at the cruel fate our kinsman endured."
