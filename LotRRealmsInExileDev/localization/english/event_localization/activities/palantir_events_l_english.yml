 ## Initiating the Event
 
 palantir.0001.t:0 "The Palantír"
 palantir.0001.desc:0 "Amongst the most coveted artifacts of the [dunedain|E] are the [palantir|E]. Wrought in the ancient west by [feanor|E], the seven seeing-stones were gifted to Amandil of Andúnië by the [eldar|E] of [toleressea|E], as comfort to the [faithfulshort|E] as the Shadow fell upon [numenor|E]. Brought to [middleearth|E] by [elendil|E] and his sons, the Seeing-Stones have not been used since the fall of Minas Ithil to the Witch-King, for the Wise of [gondor|E] deemed the danger too great. Their very existence has, for centuries, been a secret of the Ruling Stewards, who feared that should its location be revealed, the enemy shall seek to steal its power. \n\nThe Palantíri are tools of farsight, allowing its bearer to perceive things unseen, in far-away lands, and to communicate with the other seeing-stones. They are dangerous tools in this age, for it takes great will to master a Palantír and bend it to one’s purpose — and even then, you do not know who else might bear another and attempt to so strike you in return. But with great strength of mind and spirit, a Palantír could be a weapon unmatched. Gazing into the Seeing-Stone might unveil secrets most important, revealing the plans of the enemy and granting insight into their strategies. \n\nShould I then use the Palantír to grow my own strength and wisdom, or is the danger simply too great?" 
 palantir.0001.a:0 "It is a boon, a weapon to be used against the enemy."
 palantir.0001.a.tt:0 "You gaze into the Palantír."
 palantir.0001.b:0 "It is too dangerous..."
 palantir.0001.b.tt:0 "You do not look into the Palantír."
 
 ## Free Peoples
 
 palantir.0101.t:0 "The Wilds of Ithilien"
 palantir.0101.desc:0 "Pulled forward into the haze of the Palantír, I fly amongst the woodland and over the River [anduin|E], seeing all that wander and gather in the boundless forest. I perceive rangers on scouting missions, gaze upon a tribe of roving Uruks, and as my foresight moves southward I begin to understand the design of an incursion.\n\nThey are many and speak in a tongue most unkind, but their objective becomes clear to me: they mean to raid and rob the Ithilien roads, harassing the supply lines destined for the outer defenses of [gondor|E].\n\nThe woods are no longer safe, and the Shadow spreads over the deserted countryside."
 palantir.0101.a:0 "Ithilien was the first to fall, who shall be next?"
 palantir.0100.a.tt:0 "You gaze into the Palantír again."
 palantir.0100.b:0 "That is all the information I require."
 palantir.0100.b.tt:0 "You cease looking into the Palantír."
 
 palantir.0102.t:0 "The City of Pelargir"
 palantir.0102.desc:0 "At the mouths of the [anduin|E] sits the great city of Pelargir, home of the Sealords. Great vessels from along the coasts of [gondor|E] lay at anchor as mariners and guildsmen converse, spreading news of the happenings of places far-away. I hear a few of these conversations in detail, and the closer I come to the Palace of the Sealord, the more damning each story becomes. \n\nPolitics, secrets of every kind, nothing is secret when laid bare before my encompassing eye. No scandal is safe, and after a few hours of listening, you understand the political machinations of the city more than anyone else."
 palantir.0102.a:0 "Plots wrapped in plots, hidden by other plots. Such decadence!"
 
 palantir.0103.t:0 "The Withered Tree"
 palantir.0103.desc:0 "My gaze turns to [minastirith|E], espying the citizens of the Tower of Guard as they go about their daily lives. Level by level, street by street, I climb, eventually arriving at the fountain of the Great Courtyard of Kings. \n\nEven now, with such peril at hand, the Fountain Guard stand vigilant, their winged helms glistening against the magnificent radiance of the sun. They guard the withered White Tree, a symbol of the fading strength of the Men of [westernesse|E] against the storm that is rising in the East."
 palantir.0103.a.good:0 "The strength of Gondor is failing, they will not avail us."
 palantir.0103.a.evil:0 "The strength of Gondor is failing, they cannot stand against us." 
 
 palantir.0104.t:0 "The Horselords"
 palantir.0104.desc.a:0 "The Palantír once again comes alive with light, bidding my foresight look to the rolling plains of [rohan|E]. Great hosts of horsemen gather, spears raised and ready for war.\n\nLong has it been since Eorl the Young came riding across the Fields of Celebrant, and to his sons oaths of old are but children's stories.\n\n It is said that their King pays a tribute in horses to [sauronthedarklordcharacter|E], and indeed black horses are fewer than they once were among the great herds.\n\nEven fast friends of old are no longer trustworthy, each must look to their oiwn strength."
 palantir.0104.a:0 "How long before they too serve the Dark Lord?"
 
 palantir.0105.t:0 "The Throne in Nilulônde"
 palantir.0105.desc:0 "My gaze turns to the great bay of Tulwang, shining like a gleaming dagger aimed at the heart of the southern jungle. Beneath the burning sun of [harad|E], surrounded by foes North, South and East, reigns the line of Tumakveh.\n\nThey have strayed from the faith of their ancestors and mingled with the indigenous Bellanarûd, but they are beleaguered by their enemies.\n\nCorsairs of [umbar|E] harry their coasts from their northern refuge, the Storm-Host gathers its strength in [anbalkumagan|E] across the Bay and to the East, rumours of an even greater foe arise."
 palantir.0105.a.good:0 "They have troubles of their own, they will not help us"
 palantir.0105.a.evil:0 "Their forces are dwindling, they will soon fall before the assault." 
 
 palantir.0106.t:0 "The Golden Wood"
 palantir.0106.desc:0 "As I gaze into the Palantír, the countryside rushes beneath me, turning to deep forest of silver-trunked trees. Deep into those woods live the reclusive [elves|E] of [lothlorien|E], led by the arrogant [lorienking.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip].\n\nFor millenia the [galadhrimelves|E] have retreated ever deeper into their enchanted forests, caring little for the troubles of others, kept safe by their ancient magic."
 palantir.0106.a.good:0 "No help will come from the woods, the Elves are fading"
 palantir.0106.a.evil:0 "No threat will come from the woods, the Elves are fading"
 
 palantir.0107.t:0 "The Dark Woods"
 palantir.0107.desc:0 "The Seeing-Stone shows me an endless sea of trees, each darker than the next. In the South, a dark tower rises once again, guarded by a servant of [mordor|E]. He sends forth his [orcs|E] and giant spiders to assault the reclusive [lasgalendrimelves|E] in the North.\n\nSmall is their realm now, compared to the vastness of [mirkwood|E], and there is little hope the Elvenking will push back the onslaught."
 palantir.0107.a.good:0 "Ever do the Elves turn to their own troubles first, we are alone in this fight."
 palantir.0107.a.evil:0 "The Elves stand no chance against the might of Khamûl the Easterling"
 
 palantir.0108.t:0 "The Dwarf-Friends"
 palantir.0108.desc:0 "The Palantír brings me north of the plains of [rhovanion|E], to the very foot of the [lonelymountain|E]. Between its roots is the city of [dale|E], nestling snugly against the protection of the Dwarven realm.\n\nTheir partnership has made them rich beyond their wildest dreams, but peace and silver have made the line of Bard complacent and decadent, merchants rather than warriors. Men no longer know the handle of a sword or the string of a bow, they have become coin-counters and toy-makers.\n\nThey will be no match against the coming storm."
 palantir.0108.a:0 "The fierce Northmen have become fat and weak"
 
 palantir.0109.t:0 "A Tainted Vintage"
 palantir.0109.desc:0 "My gaze rushes to the East and the sea of Rhûn, a bright blue jewel gleaming set in the light green of the steppe. As I follow the River Running I reach the verdant hillside vineyards of [dorwinion|E].\n\nThe Winelords and the Master Merchants have always feudeds, various factions vying for a place in the sun. They sell their wines to the highest bidder, and though they do not serve the Shadow yet, their loyalty stands with their commercial interests.\n\nThey will not risk the anger of [sauronthedarklordcharacter|E] by siding with his enemies and their forces are more used to caravan escort than to open warfare."
 palantir.0109.a:0 "They trade all day and drink all night, they have forgotten how to fight"
 
 palantir.0110.t:0 "The Noldorin Statelet"
 palantir.0110.desc:0 "The Stone takes me to far-off [rivendell|E], built in a secret valley in the foothills of the [mistymountains|E], where in his Last Homely House hides the [rivendelllord.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip]. His ancient halls are famous for their feasts and their stories. He offers, in his magnanimity, food and lodgings to the visitors who find his valley home.\n\nFar have the race of the [noldorelves|E] fallen, that their highest lord is little more than a glorified innkeeper."
 palantir.0110.a:0 "Food, drink and songs are all they need to forget the troubles of the world"
 
 palantir.0111.t:0 "The Exit Port"
 palantir.0111.desc:0 "The Palantír takes me all the way to the [greatsea|E] and the serpentine Gulf of Lhûn. In [lindon|E], in the former realm of High King Gil-galad rules now [mithlondlord.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] the Shipwright, at the head of the greatest shipyards of the [eldar|E]. Most of the ancient cities appear deserted, their courtyards silent and their windows dark. The only concern of the few remaining [elves|E] that tarry yet in [mithlond|E] is woodwork and the preparation of the great voyage that allows them to escape the sorrows of [middleearth|E].\n\nThey care not for those who remain behind and fight the Shadow."
 palantir.0111.a:0 "They have mourned for Middle-Earth already, they have no fight left in them"

 
 ## Forces of Darkness
 
 palantir.0201.t:0 "The Plains of Harondor"
 palantir.0201.desc:0 "The winds shift, and in turn so does my gaze, moving into the open plains of Harondor. These lands are rife with open turmoil. Battles are engaged in the open fields, horses and men scream, and a flurry of arrows cut down a battalion of [haradrim|E] warriors before my very eyes. \n\nButchery, such terrible, unwarranted butchery. Long ago these lands were calm, and only the wind would disturb its inhabitants; but now the black tide of war encompasses all things living, and all one can do is hope for better times to come."
 palantir.0201.a:0 "These plains are ready for the taking"
  
 palantir.0202.t:0 "The Deserts of Abrakhân"
 palantir.0202.desc:0 "South and East of the luscious lands of [gondor|E] lie the dry deserts of foreign Abrakhân. Caravans move along common footpaths. Half of these traders move southward to pay tribute to the Golden King, whilst half move northward to deliver tribute to [sauronthedarklordcharacter|E] himself. \n\nAs I move ever-closer to the capital of the desert kingdom, things become clearer to me. Their soldiers are mustering; and even scores of Giant Scorpions gather in boundless war camps for a future offensive. Where they are going, however, remains a mystery even to me."
 palantir.0202.a:0 "They are ruled by the mystical Golden King..."

 palantir.0203.t:0 "The Easterlings of Rhûn"
 palantir.0203.desc:0 "Once more, my gaze is pulled by force, going past even the dominion of [mordor|E], to its North and East. There, in the land of Rhûn, I see ancient cities of wondrous splendour bustling with life and activity. \n\nBut as my gaze focuses, it becomes clear that this civilisation is corrupted in nature. The Easterlings are still counted amongst the allies of [sauronthedarklordcharacter|E], and even now I perceive that they plot their revenge against [gondor|E]. Hordes of men, horses, and even chariots lumber out the city gates, moving west towards the setting sun."
 palantir.0203.a:0 "Their legions grow with each passing day..."
 
 palantir.0204.t:0 "Bloodthirsty Corsairs"
 palantir.0204.desc:0 "My vision soars over the bay of Belfalas to the proud port-city of [umbar|E], where stolen gold and jewels shine upon the hands of corsair captains. Its shipyards are teeming with workers, building ever greater ships, financed by the riches plundered from the [gondorian|E] coastline.\n\nIts fearsome fleets grow by the day, and soon it will be able to overcome the lands of the [faithfulshort|E] and bleed them dry, preparing the way for the victory of [sauronthedarklordcharacter|E]."
 palantir.0204.a:0 "The strong will be slain, and the weak enslaved!"
  
 palantir.0205.t:0 "The Variags of Khând"
 palantir.0205.desc:0 "As I survey the lands east of [mordor|E], I can easily spot the fierce Variag, who once again stir in Khând at the call of their master. Large hosts of bearded men, great axes in hand, are gathering in the East of [mordor|E], awaiting the word to descend upon the lands of the Free Peoples.\n\nTheir strength is battle is matched only by their thirst for slaves and plunder. And they have long expected an occasion to feast upon the remains of [gondor|E] and its allies."
 palantir.0205.a:0 "They may fight like Dwarves, but they know no mercy."
 
 palantir.0206.t:0 "The Wild Men of Dunland"
 palantir.0206.desc:0 "The warlike Dunlending have been awoken, their thirst for vengeance upon the Forgoil stronger than ever. The tribes are gathering, their anger stoked and their hands armed by servants of the Eye.\n\nAlready they have started raiding a weakened [rohan|E], and they will soon have enough might and daring to satrt a frontal assault upon the "Straw-Heads"."
 palantir.0206.a:0 "The Men of Dunland are wild and unruly, but their hate burns bright"

## I SEE YOU !

 palantir.0300.t:0 "The Dark Tower"
 palantir.0300.desc:0 "As I look upon the plains of Gorgoroth, I feel the control of the Palantír escape me. The landscapes are replaced by an endless void of blackness. Featureless and quiet, I think of perhaps letting go of the Palantír, but before I can, I am suddenly pulled towards the impossibly strong tower of Barad-dûr in the distance. \n\nMy vision is filled with a great eye, lidless, wreathed in flame. My hand begins to burn, and in the ancient, foul tongue of [morgothcharacter|E], [sauronthedarklordcharacter|E] mocks me.\n\n'#bold I see you, [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip], who would look upon the glory of [mordor|E]. Feast your eyes all you wish!' #!\n\nMy gaze is forced over Mordor, revealing the vast armies gathering in the Dark Land. [orcs|E], Trolls and evil [conceptracemen|E], the lights from their camps as numerous as stars in the night sky.\n\n'#bold Against my power there will be no victory. Serve me if you wish to be spared! #!'\n\nI am a powerful [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] and will not be enslaved to his will, but [sauroncharacter|E]'s voice tolerates no resistance."
 palantir.0300.a:0 "I will never be made a slave of the Dark Lord!"
 palantir.0300.a.tt:0 "You break away from the Palantír"
 palantir.0300.b:0 "Command me, Sauron Lord of the Earth!"
 palantir.0300.b.tt:0 "You submit to the Dark Lord's will"
 
 ## End of activity
  
 palantir.0400.t:0 "There and Back Again"
 palantir.0400.desc:0 "As I break away from the Palantír, I feel both the urge to peer inside it once again and a great relief that the mental ordeal is over.\n\nThis task has drained a great deal of mental energy from me, and I shall not submit myself to that strain for some time, I feel.\n\nI cover the ancient orb with a cloth once more, and return it to the secret depths of my treasury."
 palantir.0400.a:0 "And now for a good night's rest"
