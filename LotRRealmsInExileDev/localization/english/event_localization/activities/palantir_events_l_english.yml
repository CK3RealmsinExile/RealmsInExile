 ## Initiating the Event
 
 palantir.0001.t:  "The Palantír"
 palantir.0001.desc:  "Amongst the most coveted artifacts of the [dunedain|E] are the [palantir|E]. Wrought in the ancient west by [feanor|E], the seven Seeing-Stones were gifted to Amandil of Andúnië by the [eldar|E] of [toleressea|E], as comfort to the [faithful|E] as the Shadow fell upon [numenor|E]. Brought to [middleearth|E] by [elendil|E] and his sons, the Seeing-Stones have not been used since the fall of Minas Ithil to the Witch-King, for the Wise of [gondor|E] deemed the danger too great.\n\nThe Palantíri are tools of farsight, allowing their users to perceive things unseen, in far-away lands, and to communicate with the other Seeing-Stones. They are dangerous tools in this age, for it takes great will to master a Palantír and bend it to one’s purpose — and even then, you do not know who else might be looking. But with great strength of mind and spirit, a Palantír could be a weapon unmatched. Gazing into the Seeing-Stone might unveil secrets most important, revealing the plans of the enemy and granting insight into their strategies. \n\nShould I then use the Palantír to grow my own strength and wisdom, or is the danger simply too great?" 
 palantir.0001.a: "It is a boon, a weapon to be used against the enemy."
 palantir.0001.a.tt: "You gaze into the Palantír."
 palantir.0001.b: "It is too dangerous..."
 palantir.0001.b.tt: "You do not look into the Palantír."

 palantir.0101.desc: "Pulled forward into the haze of the Palantír, I fly amongst the woods and over the River [anduin|E], seeing all that wander and gather in the boundless forest. I perceive rangers on scouting missions, gaze upon a tribe of roving Uruks, and as my foresight moves southward I begin to understand the design of an incursion.\n\nThey are many and speak in a tongue most unkind, but their objective becomes clear to me: they mean to raid and rob the Ithilien roads, harassing the supply lines destined for the outer defenses of [gondor|E].\n\nThe woods are no longer safe, and the Shadow spreads over the deserted countryside."
 palantir.0101.desc.alt: "Pulled forward into the haze of the Palantír, I fly amongst the woods and over the River [anduin|E], seeing all that wander and gather in the boundless forest. I perceive rangers on scouting missions, and a small community of [lasgalendrimelves|E] singing beneath the trees.\n\nThey are few but they deploy all their woodland craft to heal the lands that suffered too long under the Shadow.\n\nThe woods are safe now."
 palantir.0101.desc.pre_sauron: "Pulled forward into the haze of the Palantír, I fly amongst the woods and over the River [anduin|E], to the hilly and forested land of Ithilien. Rangers and soldiers patrol the land, marching under the banner of [gondor|E]. They guard the rugged land against marauding bands of [orcs|E] that come from the east.\n\nThough [sauroncharacter|E] has not been in [mordor|E] for a long while, Gondor keeps a close watch on its eastern border; many years it has been since the Witch-King of Angmar conquered the city of Minas Ithil, and turned into a dreadful place."
 palantir.0101.a: "Ithilien was the first to fall, who shall be next?"
 palantir.0101.a.alt: "Ithilien is the first to be healed, many still need care"

 palantir.0102.t:  "The City of Pelargir"
 palantir.0102.desc:  "At the mouths of the [anduin|E] sits the great city of Pelargir, home of the Sealords. Great vessels from along the coasts of [gondor|E] lay at anchor as mariners and guildsmen converse, spreading news of the happenings of places far-away. I hear a few of these conversations in detail, and the closer I come to the Palace of the Sealord, the more damning each story becomes. \n\nPolitics, secrets of every kind, nothing is secret when laid bare before my encompassing eye. No scandal is safe, and after a few hours of listening, I understand the political machinations of the city more than anyone else."
 palantir.0102.a:  "Plots wrapped in plots, hidden by other plots. Such decadence!"
 
 palantir.0103.t:  "The Withered Tree"
 palantir.0103.desc:  "My gaze turns to [minastirith|E], espying the citizens of the Tower of Guard as they go about their daily lives. Level by level, street by street, I climb, eventually arriving at the fountain of the Great Courtyard of Kings. \n\nEven now, with such peril at hand, the Fountain Guard stand vigilant, their winged helms glistening against the magnificent radiance of the sun. They guard the withered White Tree, a symbol of the fading strength of the Men of [westernesse|E] against the storm that is rising in the East."

They guard the flowering sapling of the White Tree, a symbol of the renewed strength of the Men of [westernesse|E]."

 palantir.0104.desc.sauron: "The Palantír once again comes alive with light, bidding my foresight look to the rolling plains of [rohan|E]. Great hosts of horsemen gather, spears raised and ready for war.\n\nLong has it been since Eorl the Young came riding across the Fields of Celebrant, and to his sons oaths of old are but children's stories.\n\nIt is said that their King pays a tribute in horses to [sauronthedarklordcharacter|E], and indeed black horses are fewer than they once were among the great herds.\n\nEven fast friends of old are no longer trustworthy, each must look to their own strength."
 palantir.0104.desc.saruman: "The Palantír once again comes alive with light, bidding my foresight look to the rolling plains of [rohan|E]. Few horses roam these lands any longer, they have mostly been killed and devoured by the [orcs|E] of [sarumancharacter|E].\n\nWhere was [gondor|E] when the Westfold fell? Who came to the Riders' aid when their need was most dire in the Battle of Helm's Deep? The House of Eorl fell and of their last deeds none will sing.\n\nFor all there bow now to the White Hand, and no Rider shall come from the North to Gondor's help."
 palantir.0104.desc.sauronless: "The Palantír once again comes alive with light, bidding my foresight look to the rolling plains of [rohan|E]. Great hosts of horsemen gather, spears raised and ready for war.\n\nLong has it been since Eorl the Young came riding across the Fields of Celebrant, but to his sons oaths of old are still alive.\n\nIt is said that their King paid a tribute in horses to [sauronthedarklordcharacter|E], and indeed black horses are fewer than they once were among the great herds. But those were lies spread by servants of [mordor|E], after stealing their horses and raiding their lands.\n\nThe [conceptracemen|E] of Rohan stay true to their friends."
 palantir.0104.desc.pre_LW: "The Palantír once again comes alive with light, bidding my foresight look to the rolling plains of [rohan|E]. Great hosts of horsemen gather, spears raised and ready for war.\n\nLong has it been since Eorl the Young came riding across the Fields of Celebrant, and to his sons oaths of old are but children's stories. Rohan faces a more pressing threat now. To the west, the Dunlendings nurse a grudge against the Rohirrim, long their foes, and it is said that mercenaries from the south join their ranks. Rohan must prepare if they are to survive this onslaught."
 palantir.0104.desc.post_LW: "The Palantír once again comes alive with light, bidding my foresight look to the rolling plains of [rohan|E]. Long has it been since Eorl the Young came riding across the Fields of Celebrant, and to his sons oaths of old are but children's stories.\n\n In this hour, however, the Rohirrim are filled with mirth. Rohan's western borders are secure, for the Dunlendings to the west, long rivals of the Rohirrim, have been defeated."
 palantir.0104.desc.dunlending: "The Palantír once again comes alive with light, bidding my foresight look to the rolling plains of [rohan|E]. Yet no longer do the proud and golden-haired Rohirrim ride upon the green and golden fields; for Meduseld, Golden Hall of Edoras, is occupied by an enemy.\n\nThe Dunlendings, who formerly resided west of the Isen, are now lords of these lands. The valiant Horselords are now mere subjects, their bravery broken."
 palantir.0104.a: "How long before they too serve the Shadow?"
 palantir.0104.a.saruman: "What can Men do against such reckless hate?"

 palantir.0105.desc:  "My gaze turns to the great bay of Tulwang, shining like a gleaming dagger aimed at the heart of the southern jungle. Beneath the burning sun of [harad|E], surrounded by foes North, South and East, reigns the line of Tumakveh.\n\nThey have strayed from the faith of their ancestors and mingled with the indigenous Bellanarûd, but they are beleaguered by their enemies.\n\nCorsairs of [umbar|E] harry their coasts from their northern refuge, the Storm-Host gathers its strength in [anbalkumagan|E] across the Bay and to the East, rumours of an even greater foe arise."

 palantir.0106.desc:  "As I gaze into the Palantír, the countryside rushes beneath me, turning to deep forest of silver-trunked trees. Deep into those woods live the reclusive [elves|E] of [lothlorien|E], led by the arrogant [lorienking.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip].\n\nFor millenia the [galadhrimelves|E] have retreated ever deeper into their enchanted forests, caring little for the troubles of others, kept safe by their ancient magic."

Soon these woods will be empty, save for the echoes of their forgotten songs."

 palantir.0107.desc: "The Seeing-Stone shows me an endless sea of trees, each darker than the next. In the South, a dark tower rises once again, guarded by a servant of [mordor|E]. He sends forth his [orcs|E] and giant spiders to assault the reclusive [lasgalendrimelves|E] in the North.\n\nSmall is their realm now, compared to the vastness of [mirkwood|E], and there is little hope the Elvenking will push back the onslaught."
 palantir.0107.desc.alt: "The Seeing-Stone shows me an endless sea of trees, each darker than the next. In the South, the ruins of a dark tower rise above the tree-tops, its guardian banished. His [orcs|E] and spiders no longer trouble the peace of the woods.\n\nThe [lasgalendrimelves|E] once agains roam the vastness of [greenwood|E], but how long before they too leave for the [undyinglands|E]?"
 palantir.0107.desc.necromancer: "The Seeing-Stone shows me an endless sea of trees, and it seems a dark and thick shadow, almost like smoke, hangs over them. Upon a burnt hill rises a black and fell tower, though as I am taken closer it becomes clear this is a small and dreadful fortress.\n\nThis is Dol Guldur, and within it hide all manner of savage and abominable creatures. Here is the abode of The Necromancer, a sorcerer said to raise the dead and conjure evil spirits to assault the reclusive [lasgalendrimelves|E] in the North.\n\nSmall is their realm now, compared to the vastness of [mirkwood|E], and there is little hope the Elvenking will push back the onslaught."

 palantir.0108.desc.sauron: "The Palantír brings me north of the plains of [rhovanion|E], to the very foot of the snow-capped [lonelymountain|E]. Between its roots is the city of [dale|E], nestling snugly against the protection of the Dwarven realm.\n\nTheir partnership has made them rich beyond their wildest dreams, but peace and silver have made the line of Bard complacent and decadent, merchants rather than warriors. Men and Dwarves alike no longer know the handle of a sword or the string of a bow, they have become coin-counters and toy-makers.\n\nThey will be no match against the coming storm."

Between its roots is the city of [dale|E], nestling uneasily against the mountain realm, a great wall, freshly built, protects the city from any who would come from that direction.\n\nThe great Dwarven figures carved into the rock are disfigured, and crude shacks have sprouted in the great halls. Sounds of drums and raucous Orcish voices can be heard day and night."
 palantir.0108.desc.smaug: "The Palantír brings me north of the plains of [rhovanion|E], to the very foot of the snow-capped [lonelymountain|E]. The great gates of the Mountain stand, yet even from afar it is apparent all is not well.\n\nMuch of the land is bare and ashen, and not even wild animals dare to approach the mountain. This is the Desolation of Smaug, last of the great fire-drakes, and the riches of the once great realm of Erebor are now naught but a mighty bed for the dragon to sleep upon.

As I follow the River Running I reach the verdant hillside vineyards of [dorwinion|E].\n\nThe Winelords and the Master Merchants have always feuded, various factions vying for a place in the sun. They sell their wines to the highest bidder, and though they do not serve the Shadow yet, their loyalty stands with their commercial interests.\n\nThey will not risk the anger of [sauronthedarklordcharacter|E] by siding with his enemies and their forces are more used to caravan escort than to open warfare."

These days they sound more and more empty, as the last of the [noldorelves|E] are leaving [middleearth|E] for [valinor|E], and the magic of the [eldar|E] fades from the land.

 palantir.0205.desc:  "As I survey the lands east of [mordor|E], I can easily spot the fierce Variag, who once again stir in [khand|E] at the call of their master. Large hosts of bearded men, great axes in hand, are gathering in the East of [mordor|E], awaiting the word to descend upon the lands of the Free Peoples.\n\nTheir strength in battle is matched only by their thirst for slaves and plunder. And they have long expected an occasion to feast upon the remains of [gondor|E] and its allies."
 palantir.0205.a:  "They may fight like Dwarves, but they know no mercy."

 palantir.0206.desc:  "As I look towards Enedwaith and Dunland, I can see multiple raiding parties, small bands of armed men going to [rohan|E] with torches, and returning with plunder.\n\nThe warlike Dunlending have been awoken, their thirst for vengeance upon the Forgoil stronger than ever. The tribes are gathering, their anger stoked and their hands armed by servants of the Eye.\n\nAlready they have started raiding a weakened Riddermark, and they will soon have enough might and daring to start a frontal assault upon the "Straw-Heads"."
 palantir.0206.desc.alt:  "As I look towards Enedwaith and Dunland, I can see peaceful herds grazing in the hills, watched upon by vigilant guardians.\n\nThe warlike Dunlending have been pardoned by [rohan|E], their thirst for vengeance upon the Forgoil no longer troubles them. The warriors gathered by the Shadow have renounced their claim on the Riddermark.\n\nThe new trade relations will hopefully help both sides to put old grudges at rest."

Within the ancient and abandoned delvings of the [dwarves|E] scurry and muster hordes of [orcs|E] and Goblins.\n\nWithout a strong leader to unite them, the scattered tribes of goblins and orcs in their dark corridors and halls and caves bicker and fight as they always have. It would take a rare skill and malevolence to unite these bitter enemies.\n\nBeneath the chaotic activity, a dark and ancient terror lurks."

Within the ancient and abandoned delvings of the [dwarves|E] scurry and muster hordes of [orcs|E] and Goblins.\n\nYet among them all, one stands out. In the dark halls of [moria|E], one Azog is a promising and mighty figure. [dwarrowdelf|E] he has subjugated under his iron fist, and with his soaring ambitions and savage will, the rest of the Misty Mountains will not be safe from his wrath.\n\nBeneath the sounds of war, a dark and ancient terror lurks."
 palantir.0207.desc.dwarf: "I view now the towering peaks of the [mistymountains|E], their topmost peaks rosy in the evening light. Within the halls of rock and stone, hammers strike anvils, for craftsmen are at work.\n\nThe Dwarven realm of [khazaddum|E], though once fallen, has been born anew. The [orcs|E] have been at least mostly cleansed from the realm, and its ancient halls are filled once more with light from lamps crystal hewn. Though there are still perils that the new kingdom faces, the sons of Mahal are glad."

## I SEE YOU !

 palantir.0300.t:  "The Dark Tower"
 palantir.0300.desc:  "As I look upon the plains of Gorgoroth, I feel the control of the Palantír escape me. The landscapes are replaced by an endless void of blackness. Featureless and quiet, I think of perhaps letting go of the Palantír, but before I can, I am suddenly pulled towards the impossibly strong tower of Barad-dûr in the distance. \n\nMy vision is filled with a great eye, lidless, wreathed in flame. My hand begins to burn, and in the ancient, foul tongue of [morgothcharacter|E], [sauronthedarklordcharacter|E] mocks me.\n\n'#bold I see you, [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip], who would look upon the glory of [mordor|E]. Feast your eyes all you wish!' #!\n\nMy gaze is forced over Mordor, revealing the vast armies gathering in the Dark Land. [orcs|E], Trolls and evil [conceptracemen|E], the lights from their camps as numerous as stars in the night sky.\n\n'#bold Against my power there will be no victory. Serve me if you wish to be spared! #!'"

 palantir.0400.desc:  "As I break away from the Palantír, I feel both the urge to peer inside it once again and a great relief that the mental ordeal is over.\n\nThis task has drained a great deal of mental energy from me, and I shall not submit myself to that strain for some time, I feel.\n\nI cover the ancient orb with a cloth once more, and return it to the secret depths of my treasury."
 palantir.0400.a:  "And now for a good night's rest."
