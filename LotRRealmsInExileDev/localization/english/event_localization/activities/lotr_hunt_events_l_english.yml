 lotr_hunt.0001.desc: "As the hunting party passes through a small clearing, we stop for a short moment to admire the breathtaking view that unfolds before our eyes. Rolling hills and verdant glades stretch out towards the horizon, and the sun's gentle rays make the colors shine even more vibrant than usual.\n\nI turn to [hunting_elf.GetName], who is standing nearby. Should I encourage everyone to take in the untamed beauty of nature's sights? Or should we focus on the hunt, lest the game escapes us?"
 lotr_hunt.0001.a: "[yavannacharacter|E]'s creation endures - as should we."
 lotr_hunt.0001.b: "Come! Let us not tarry and lose our prey!"
