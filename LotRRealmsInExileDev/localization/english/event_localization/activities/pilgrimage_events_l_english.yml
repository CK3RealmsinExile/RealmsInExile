 pilgrimage.5901.desc:0 "Deep in the trackless Mouths of the Gwathló, our people were born, and they thrived until the coming of the people out of the sea. These people devastated the lands and tore down forests until the ocean swallowed them whole. But our people endure while their kingdoms in exile diminish. The Carras, as we name the great estuary of the Gwathló has retained her natural beauty, and many people make a pilgrimage to the sacred place."
