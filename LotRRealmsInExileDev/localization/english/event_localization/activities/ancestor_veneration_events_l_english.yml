 # Ancestor Veneration Start Event

 ancestor_veneration.0001.t: "An Area of Focus"
 ancestor_veneration.0001.desc: "As all my guests have arrived and my [GetCourtPositionType('chronicler_court_position').GetName()] makes some final arrangements, I make my way to the archives. Bundles of scrolls lie in wait, far more than I could ever read in a single lifetime. The archives hold the long histories of the [dwarves|E].\n\nChief among them accounts of the seven [dwarffathers|E] and their incarnations, who are believed to return to life until each has lived seven times.\n\nThen there are others who made a name for themselves among the seven clans, whether for honour or infamy."
 ancestor_veneration.0001.a: "The incarnations of Durin the Deathless of the Longbeards..."
 ancestor_veneration.0001.b: "The incarnations of Úri the Scarred of the Firebeards..."
 ancestor_veneration.0001.c: "The incarnations of Dwálin the Wise of the Broadbeams..."
 ancestor_veneration.0001.d: "The incarnations of Sindri the Rich of the Ironfists..."
 ancestor_veneration.0001.e: "The incarnations of Thúlin the Swift of the Stiffbeards..."
 ancestor_veneration.0001.f: "The incarnations of Thrár the Proud of the Blacklocks..."
 ancestor_veneration.0001.g: "The incarnations of Bavór the Cold of the Stonefoots..."
 ancestor_veneration.0001.h: "The lives of various Dwarves of great renown..."

 ancestor_veneration.0011.t: "Incarnations of Durin the Deathless"
 ancestor_veneration.0011.desc: "The first of the [dwarffathers|E], [durindeathless|E], was shaped by [mahalcharacter|E] during the [dwarfcreation|E], beneath the northern reaches of the [mistymountains|E], before the awakening of [elves|E] and [men|E]. He was the forefather of the [longbeards|E].\n\nThe accounts of his reincarnations must be many, and I marvel at how his spirit has survived through all time."
 ancestor_veneration.0011.a: "Let us turn to the stories of Durin's feats..."
 ancestor_veneration.0011.b: "On second thought..."

 ancestor_veneration.0012.t: "Incarnations of Úri the Scarred"
 ancestor_veneration.0012.desc: "One of the [dwarffathers|E], [uriscarred|E] was shaped by [mahalcharacter|E] during the [dwarfcreation|E] and awoke in the [west|E] beside [dwalinwise|E], before the awakening of [elves|E] and [men|E]. He was the forefather of the [firebeards|E].\n\nWhat chronicles might exist of his repeated lives, and how his essence has withstood the passing ages?"
 ancestor_veneration.0012.a: "The time has come to recount the deeds of Úri..."
 ancestor_veneration.0012.b: "On second thought..."

 ancestor_veneration.0013.t: "Incarnations of Dwálin the Wise"
 ancestor_veneration.0013.desc: "One of the [dwarffathers|E], [dwalinwise|E] was shaped by [mahalcharacter|E] during the [dwarfcreation|E] and awoke in the [west|E] beside [uriscarred|E]. He was the forefather of the [broadbeams|E], before the awakening of [elves|E] and [men|E].\n\nI cannot help but wonder what tales are told of his incarnations, and how his spirit has endured through the ages."
 ancestor_veneration.0013.a: "It's time to unfold the chronicles of Dwálin..."
 ancestor_veneration.0013.b: "On second thought..."

 ancestor_veneration.0014.t: "Incarnations of Sindri the Rich"
 ancestor_veneration.0014.desc: "One of the [dwarffathers|E], [sindririch|E] was shaped by [mahalcharacter|E] during the [dwarfcreation|E] and awoke in the [east|E] beside [thulinswift|E], before the awakening of [elves|E] and [men|E]. He was the forefather of the [ironfists|E].\n\nI find myself contemplating the histories of his incarnations and the lasting endurance of his soul."
 ancestor_veneration.0014.a: "Let the tales of Sindri's exploits be told..."
 ancestor_veneration.0014.b: "On second thought..."

 ancestor_veneration.0015.t: "Incarnations of Thúlin the Swift"
 ancestor_veneration.0015.desc: "One of the [dwarffathers|E], [thulinswift|E] was shaped by [mahalcharacter|E] during the [dwarfcreation|E] and awoke in the [east|E] beside [sindririch|E], before the awakening of [elves|E] and [men|E]. He was the forefather of the [stiffbeards|E].\n\nTales of his many lives surely abound, and I wonder how his spirit remains unbroken through the ages."
 ancestor_veneration.0015.a: "Now we turn our gaze to the legacy of Thúlin..."
 ancestor_veneration.0015.b: "On second thought..."

 ancestor_veneration.0016.t: "Incarnations of Thrár the Proud"
 ancestor_veneration.0016.desc: "One of the [dwarffathers|E], [thrarproud|E] was shaped by [mahalcharacter|E] during the [dwarfcreation|E] and awoke in the [east|E ] beside [bavorcold|E], before the awakening of [elves|E] and [men|E]. He was the forefather of the [blacklocks|E].\n\nThe legends of his incarnations fascinate me, as does the resilience of his spirit across time."
 ancestor_veneration.0016.a: "The stories of Thrár's adventures await..."
 ancestor_veneration.0016.b: "On second thought..."

 ancestor_veneration.0017.t: "Incarnations of Bavór the Cold"
 ancestor_veneration.0017.desc: "One of the [dwarffathers|E], [bavorcold|E] was shaped by [mahalcharacter|E] during the [dwarfcreation|E] and awoke in the [east|E] beside [thrarproud|E], before the awakening of [elves|E] and [men|E]. He was the forefather of the [stonefoots|E].\n\nI often ponder the stories woven around his many incarnations and the strength of his enduring spirit."
 ancestor_veneration.0017.a: "It's time to unfold the legend of Bavór..."
 ancestor_veneration.0017.b: "On second thought..."

 ancestor_veneration.0018.t: "Dwarves of Great Renown"
 ancestor_veneration.0018.desc: "Beyond the tales of the seven [dwarffathers|E], the histories tell of many other [dwarves|E] of great significance from all seven clans. Warriors, craftsmen, kings, and explorers whose deeds have echoed through the ages, whether for honour, wisdom, or darker deeds.\n\nTheir lives and legacies have left deep marks on Dwarven history, shaping the fate of their people in ways both grand and subtle."
 ancestor_veneration.0018.a: "I shall study the great Dwarves of the seven clans..."
 ancestor_veneration.0018.b: "On second thought..."

 ancestor_veneration.0040.t: "Setting Things Up"
 ancestor_veneration.0040.host: "As we await the arrival of the rest of the guests, my servants have begun the preparations. The scholars are sent in search of ancient scrolls while setting up our equipment in the guest chambers and the archives.\n\n"
 ancestor_veneration.0040.guest: "As we await the arrival of the rest of the guests, [host.GetTitledFirstName] has begun the preparations. [host.GetHerHis|U] scholars are sent in search of ancient scrolls while setting up our equipment in the guest chambers and the archives.\n\n"
 ancestor_veneration.0040.standard: "The tablets of stone are made ready for the scrolls of our forebears. The veneration shall soon commence..."

 ancestor_veneration.0101.t: "Venerate the Ancestors: Durin I, the Deathless"
 ancestor_veneration.0101.desc: "The scroll speaks of [durindeathless|E], first of the [dwarves|E] to awaken, in [Glossary('Mazalabkân','mazalabkan_gloss')], beneath Mount [gunduzbad|E]. He was the eldest of the seven [dwarffathers|E], [dwarffather|E] of the [longbeards|E] and founded the House of [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofdurinI').GetDynasty.GetName]. Alone [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofdurinI').GetFirstNameRegnal] journeyed through lands where none had walked, naming the hills and dells in a world still young, as the [songofdurin|E] recalls.\n\nIn time, [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'lineofdurinI' ).GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal] came to the Mirrormere, where strange stars crowned the water's surface — a sign, he believed, of his purpose. There he raised Durin's Stone and founded [khazaddum|E] above the lake, hewing halls from the mountain that would become the pride of all Dwarfkind.\n\nIn the deep places beneath [GetTitleByKey('k_khazad_dum').GetNameNoTier], he discovered [mithril|E], and from this rare treasure he forged for himself Durin's Helm, a regal masked greathelm, which would become a famed heirloom of his people. He lived exceptionally long for [dwarf|E] and passed some time before the [firstage|E]'s end. His tomb lies deep within Khazad-dûm."
 ancestor_veneration.0101.a: "May my deeds honour his memory."
 ancestor_veneration.0101.b: "He understood that distant roads bring hidden riches."
 ancestor_veneration.0101.c: "The mastery of his craft was a marvel to many."

 ancestor_veneration.0102.t: "Venerate the Ancestors: Durin II"
 ancestor_veneration.0102.desc: "The scroll tells of [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofdurinII').GetFirstNameRegnal], ruling over [khazaddum|E] during a time of peace and power. [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofdurinII').GetFirstName] looked beyond the mountain halls and forged bonds with the neighbouring realm of [eregion|E].\n\nIn a rare gesture of trust, he entrusted the construction of the West-gate of [GetTitleByKey('k_khazad_dum').GetNameNoTier] to the artistry of both [dwarf|E] and [elf|E], commissioning [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofnarvi').GetFirstName], master craftsman of Khazad-dûm, and [celebrimbor|e], the Elven-lord of [eregion|E], to construct the [doorsofdurin|E], a collaboration that would foster a lasting friendship between Durin and Celebrimbor.\n\nDuring his visits to the city of [GetTitleByKey('c_ost_in_edhil').GetNameNoTier], mainly the district of [Glossary('Arost','arost_gloss')], where Durin had been granted [Glossary('Bar Durin','bar_durin_gloss')] by [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineoffeanor10').GetFirstName], Durin II delighted in experimenting with axe designs, refining forms that balanced function and beauty. With Celebrimbor's guidance, this culmination of craftsmanship led to the creation of Durin's Axe, a masterpiece adorned with intricate [ithildin|E] markings wrought by Celebrimbor himself. Like the creation of the Doors of Durin, this axe forever marked a rare moment of unity between the peoples of the Dwarves and Elves."
 ancestor_veneration.0102.a: "Let us honour Durin's wisdom and seek friendships beyond our halls."
 ancestor_veneration.0102.b: "The Longbeards needed no aid to find their fortune."

 ancestor_veneration.0103.t: "Venerate the Ancestors: Durin III"
 ancestor_veneration.0103.desc: "The scroll speaks of [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofdurinIII').GetFirstNameRegnal], ruler of the [longbeards|E] in the [secondage|E], when the [dwarves|E] of [khazaddum|E] shared rare friendship with the [elves|E] of [eregion|E]. Guided by [annatarcharacter|E], 'the Lord of Gifts', the Elven-smiths under [celebrimbor|E] began forging the [ringsofpower|E]. Despite vicious rumours that it was [sauroncharacter|E] who bestowed the [Concept('sevenringsofdwarves', 'Ring of the Longbeards')|E] on [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofdurinIII').GetFirstName], scholars hold true that it was given by [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineoffeanor10').GetFirstName].\n\nWhen the Dark Lord revealed his true purpose in [ageSA|E] 1695 and assailed [GetTitleByKey('k_eregion').GetNameNoTier], [gundabad|E], [eriador|E], and the [greymountains|E] with Orcs and Savage [men|E] from the [east|E], Dwarven warriors marched to aid the Elves, but their defence proved unsuccessful. After Eregion fell in S.A. 1697, the [doorsofdurin|E] were shut to seal the western passage into [GetTitleByKey('k_khazad_dum').GetNameNoTier].\n\nBy S.A. 1698, [GetTitleByKey('d_gundabad').GetNameNoTier] too was lost, despite fierce resistance. The [allianceofdwarvesandmen|E], bloodied by grievous losses among the [northmen|E], could not endure. With the fall of Gundabad, the Longbeards were sundered from their kin in the [ironhills|E]."
 ancestor_veneration.0103.a: "Sauron's treachery shall not be forgotten, nor left unavenged."
 ancestor_veneration.0103.b: "The Elves should have been warier of well-intentioned strangers."

 ancestor_veneration.0104.t: "Venerate the Ancestors: Durin IV"
 ancestor_veneration.0104.desc: "The scroll describes [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofdurinIV').GetFirstNameRegnal], ruler of [khazaddum|E] and [dwarffather|E] of the [longbeards|E], who marched to war when [middleearth|E]'s doom was near and later managed to reclaim [gundabad|E], though only for the remainder of his life. At the end of the [secondage|E], he stood beside the greatest kings of [elves|E] and [men|E]. [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineoforodreth4').GetFirstName], [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineoforopher1').GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal], [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofamdir1').GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal] and [elendil|E] formed the [lastallianceshort|E] against the Shadow of [mordor|E], with the aid of [durinsfolk|E]. Shockingly, the [treacheryoforn|E] saw some of the [ironfists|E] join [sauroncharacter|E]'s cause, led by their King [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofsindri102').GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal], who secretly bartered warriors and weapons for the Dark Lord's gold.\n\nOne by one, the great kings fell: Oropher at Dagorlad, [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofanarion1').GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal] beneath [GetTitleByKey('c_barad_dur').GetNameNoTier], and Gil-galad and [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofelendil').GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal] in the final battle by [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofsauron').GetFirstName]'s might. In the chaos, [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineisildur0').GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal] picked up [narsil|E] and severed the [masterring|E] from Sauron's hand, destroying him. Durin IV was one of the few kings to survive the onslaught, while Ôrn perished amid the fighting, along with his hopes for wealth.\n\nIsildur thereafter sealed his own fate by keeping the Ring and was slain by [orcs|E] near the Anduin two years later, where [Concept('onering', 'Isildur’s Bane')|E] was lost to time."
 ancestor_veneration.0104.a: "Victory demands sacrifice. We must be ready to pay its price."
 ancestor_veneration.0104.b: "Let the fallen kings rest. We endure because we stand alone."

 ancestor_veneration.0105.t: "Venerate the Ancestors: Durin V"
 ancestor_veneration.0105.desc: "The scroll recalls [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'lineofdurinV' ).GetFirstNameRegnal], ruler of [khazaddum|E] when its halls were at their grandest. Beneath the [mistymountains|E], the [longbeards|E] thrived, drawing gold, minerals, gemstones and [mithril|E] from the deeps in greater abundance than ever before or since, empowered by the [Concept('sevenringsofdwarves', 'Ring of the Longbeards')|E].\n\nWhile the dark powers of earlier ages remained dormant, the [dwarves|E] labored without fear, not knowing they would one day stir again. Their forges burned hot, their anvils rang with skilled labor, and their delvings pushed deeper into the earth. The gates of [GetTitleByKey('k_khazad_dum').GetNameNoTier] remained closed to most, but none could doubt its greatness. The name of [durin|E] carried significant weight in all corners of [middleearth|E].\n\nIn these years, the Longbeards looked seldom beyond their mountains, for they had no need to. Their realm was mighty. [dwarrowdelf|E], glorious. So passed the reign of Durin V, a time of unmatched splendour, never again seen in the days to follow."
 ancestor_veneration.0105.a: "To seek peace and prosperity is the purpose of any ruler."
 ancestor_veneration.0105.b: "A reign with conquest is meaningless."
 ancestor_veneration.0105.c: "Their mastery allowed them to delve deeper than ever before."

These secrets, fiercely guarded, became the root of their fortune. Soon, the eastern clans came bearing gold for Ironfist work — and Sindri let them pay.\n\nHis halls grew rich with the bounty of four clans.

Khathzâ journeyed south with [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofuri5').GetFirstNameRegnal], and those who followed his teachings became known as the [Glossary('Mazalikân','mazalikan_gloss')]. Others, led by Thrur's brother [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('secondlineofuri1').GetFirstNameRegnal], chose instead to uphold the old ways and settled in [khazaddum|E].\n\nKhathzâ's legacy remains: a deep suspicion of [elves|E] and outsiders, a belief in self-reliance, and a proud, if fractured, Firebeard identity."

Renowned among the [broadbeams|E], his friendship with the [noldor|E] deepened his devotion to [mahalcharacter|E], regarded by the Noldor as a close friend and teacher. Their veneration of [yavannacharactershort|E] moved some of the Broadbeams to start following [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofdwalin5').GetFaith.GetAdjective], a faith emphasising reverence for all the earth's gifts. Azaghâl forged an alliance with [maedhros|E] of the [houseoffeanor|E], after the [elven|E] prince saved him from an [orc|E] ambush on the [dwarf|E]-road of [beleriand|E]. In gratitude, Azaghâl gifted him the [dragon_helm_of_dor_lomin|E], a masterpiece made by [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'lineoftelchar1' ).GetFirstName] of [nogrod|E].\n\nThe account concludes with the [Glossary('Nirnaeth Arnoediad','nirnaeth_arnoediad_gloss')], where Azaghâl and his warriors stood against the dread [dragon|E] Glaurung. Though struck down in the clash, Azaghâl, with his dying breath, drove a knife into Glaurung's belly, wounding him grievously and forcing the dragon and his brood to retreat to [angband|E]. The Dwarves bore Azaghâl's body away, singing a deep dirge as they moved in solemn procession, and none dared attack them."

In his youth, he spent many years in the [firebeard|E] realm of [nogrod|E], reinforcing the ties of the brother-clans. It is said that he was considered a close friend of King [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofuri3').GetFirstNameRegnal]. As a result, when the [nauglamir|E] incident occurred and [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofelwe1').GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal] was slain, he pushed strongly for his brother and ruler to join the forces of Nogrod and march on [GetTitleByKey('k_doriath').GetNameNoTier].\n\nHowever, Dwálin would not be easily pushed to war, and could perceive the tragedy that loomed. Belegost urged Nogrod to show restraint, but nonetheless, Naugladur marched on Doriath and was slain in an ambush shortly afterward. These events caused a rift between the brothers, hot-tempered, spirited Bodruith and solemn, reserved Dwálin, and in time led Bodruith to embrace the ways of the[GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofdwalin7').GetFaith.GetAdherentNamePlural].\n\nAfter Dwálin II chose to lead much of his people to [khazaddum|E], Bodruith opted to remain in the [bluemountains|E] with his younger nephew [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('secondlineofdwalin1').GetFirstNameRegnal]. It is said he was one of the few [broadbeams|E] still welcomed by [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofuri5').GetFirstNameRegnal] in the realm of [GetTitleByKey('k_buzra_dum').GetNameNoTier] founded after the [warofwrath|E]."

Yet [GetTitleByKey('k_nogrod').GetNameNoTier]'s halls gave neither gold nor glory, and his kin's whispers soon turned to scorn. $Skorgr_im$'s heart turned bitter, and so he listened when [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('nazgul1').GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal] commanded him to bring the [dwarvenrings|E] of the [bluemountains|E].\n\nTo gain favour, he betrayed not one but two kings: [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofdwalinV').GetFirstNameRegnal], slain under false peace, and [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofuri67').GetFirstNameRegnal], murdered in secret council. With both ancestral rings in hand, he fled to [angmar|E], seeking his promised reward, [durin|e]'s place of awakening, [gundabad|E].\n\nBut the Witch-King's promise was treachery in truth. $Skorgr_im$ and those few still loyal to him were struck down, putting an end to his insatiable ambition."

There, the stone still echoes with the sacred songs taught by Mahal."

### IRONFISTS ###

 ancestor_veneration.0410.desc: "This scroll tells of [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofsindri102').GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal], whose greed nearly broke the [ironfists|E]. After the [akallabeth|E], ruin fell on [GetTitleByKey('k_kheled_nala').GetNameNoTier]. [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofsindri100').GetFirstNameRegnal] was crushed by rubble, the vaults intact but vulnerable, and the Ironfists were scattered, many dwelling in the plains of [rhun|E]. In the ashes rose his son Ôrn, a prince of greed and deceit. To rebuild, he struck a bargain with [sauroncharacter|E], trading warriors for [mithril|E] and gold. While leading his loyalists to war, he left his son [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofsindri104').GetFirstName] behind under the ruse of a trade mission to [rhun|E]. Thus began the [treacheryoforn|E]. It is said that upon uncovering the duplicity of the Ironfists, [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofdurinIV').GetFirstNameRegnal] cursed Ôrn's descendants, declaring that their [dwarffather|E], [sindri|E], would not walk among the Ironfists again for as long as their line endured.\n\nIn the Ered Harmal, the Ironfists established [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofsindri52').GetFirstNameRegnal], descendant of [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofsindri37').GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal], as their new ruler, who founded [GetTitleByKey('k_namagaluz').GetNameNoTier], where the Ironfists began anew. Buldin, wearing the [Concept('sevenringsofdwarves','Ring of the Ironfists')|E], was exiled alongside his loyalists and fled northwest to the remote mining colony of [GetTitleByKey('k_nurunkizdin').GetNameNoTier]. There they drove out the Ironfist nobles settled there, carving out a bitter refuge. In time, a [dragon|E] descended upon Nurunkhizdín, drawn by tales of treasure. It devoured the hold and its people, leading to the ruin of Ôrn's line and destruction of the Ring of the Ironfists.

Under the rule of her father [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofsindri0a').GetFirstNameRegnal], the [ironfists|E] prospered, but with fortune came overconfidence. When the other clans neared the secrets of iron, her brother [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofsindri0c').GetFirstNameRegnal] broke the ancient accords and seized the iron-rich hold of [GetTitleByKey('d_kheled_dum').GetNameNoTier] from its [stiffbeard|E] holder [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofthulin0cbrother').GetFirstNameRegnal]. In reply, the Stiffbeards, [blacklocks|E], and [stonefoots|E] formed a league, cut off trade, and uncovered the secrets for themselves. When the Ironfists demanded trade or threatened war, the league called for restitution.\n\nThus began the [warofiron|E]. The Ironfists were ultimately harshly defeated, severely underestimating their opposition and most were exiled to the Ered Harmal, and all three of Thrîs's brothers were killed in the war. This left her to rule what remained of their people, and her ascent marked an unprecedented moment - the first [dwarven|E] Queen in memory. Long opposed to the war, she made peace with the other three eastern clans, the exiled Ironfists viewed this act as dishonour. Upon her death, she was succeeded by her son [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofdhrim1').GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal] who was not of Sindri's line. In the years that followed, the royal seat of the Ironfists passed instead to the exiled [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofsindri0e').GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal], who founded [GetTitleByKey('k_kheled_nala').GetNameNoTier] with many of the other exiles."

It was during the [secondage|E], briefly after the [waroftheelvesandsauron|E], when the Stiffbeards came into possession of a [ringofpower|E]. As the silver wealth of [kibilzahar|E], the mansion of the Stiffbeards, was newly uncovered, their realm drew the attention of great [dragons|E] from the wilds. None proved so fierce as Veznarûkh, the Flame of Ruin, half-blind due to an arrow wound.\n\nDuring one of Veznarûkh's assaults, [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofhevdrok').GetFirstName] stood against him. Though not alone, his courage stood apart. As others loosed arrows that could not pierce its hide, he scaled a ruined fortress and struck deep into its wing. The dragon fell, tearing off Hevdrok's arm and hurling him to the rubble. Yet Hevdrok rose once more. The half-blind beast mocked Hevdrok's missing arm, unaware of the axe he still wielded, until Hevdrok cleaved the Dragon's skull before succumbing.\n\nHis kin bore him to [Glossary('Kibiltumun','kibiltumun_gloss')] beneath [GetTitleByKey('k_kibilzahar').GetNameNoTier], the sole place from which the Stiffbeards believe [mahalcharacter|E] guides their dead to the Halls beyond.

For decades, corruption spread as King [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('secondlineofthrar73').GetFirstNameRegnal] and his younger sons fell under [sauroncharacter|E]'s shadow while the eldest son [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('secondlineofthrar75').GetFirstNameRegnal] resisted. After Bhormûl's death in [ageTA|E] 2440, Bohûr ruled briefly before being slain by his brothers, igniting civil war.\n\nRôn led those not loyal to Sauron into exile at [GetTitleByKey('e_bizaruldum').GetNameNoTier], forging a war-host bound by vengeance. Nargubraz, allied with Ruartar, waged relentless war until the White Wizard [sarumancharacter|E] united the scattered forces near the conflict's end. Together with the [stonefoot|E] monarchs and [blacklocks|E] of Bizarûldûm, the Exiles of Nargubraz and the [men|E] of Lôkhas Drûs, Saruman's coalition defeated the shadow's proxy in T.A. 2459.

His legacy endures through steadfast resolve and noble lineage as [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofbarukodlig3').GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal] married [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('secondlineofthrar77').GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal], uniting claims and strengthening their right to lead."

His hatred for [goblins|E] was not born on the battlefield but in childhood, when he watched helplessly as they took his sister [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofgorovod4').GetFirstNameRegnal]'s life during a raid near the northern marches. Gorovôd had always been shy in his early life, but from that day, he lived for vengeance and refused to ever take off his helmet. He joined Thrár's campaigns not for honour or coin, but to see Goblin blood spilled.\n\nWhen the armies of [GetTitleByKey('e_bizaruldum').GetNameNoTier] returned home, Gorovôd did not. He lingered in the northern deeps, hunting warbands and guarding forsaken passes long after the realm had withdrawn. When false word reached him that Thrár had fallen, his fury blazed anew, and he vanished into the dark, chasing the last echoes of war.\n\nIn his final stand, outnumbered and maimed in the lower tunnels, he ordered his companions to collapse the passage behind him. Alone, he held the line until the cave-in sealed his fate. No tomb bears his name, but in the deep places where Goblins linger, his legend remains a warning."

While the [ironfists|E] became rich through their mastery of wrought iron, the Stonefoots won wealth and fame through the art of jewelcrafting. Zabad's works, renowned for their extravagant brilliance, were prized not only by his own folk but also by the other Free Peoples.\n\nZabad broke with much of [dwarven|E] custom in his pursuit of artistic craft. Under his guidance, the Stonefoots became preferred partners of the [elven|E]-King [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofnurwe2').GetFirstName] of the [hisildi|E], who bartered fine woodworking and other goods of the surface for Stonefoot treasures. This trade brought rare dyes and pigments into Stonefoot hands, sparking an expansion of their skills into the arts of mural and painting, with a mastery now rivaling their gemcraft.\n\nThough his knowledge and craft brought great wealth to his kin, Zabad's greater legacy is the spirit of artistry that the Stonefoots uphold with pride to this day."
