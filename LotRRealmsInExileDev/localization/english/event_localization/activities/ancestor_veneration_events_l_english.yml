 ancestor_veneration.0001.desc: "As all my guests have arrived and my [GetCourtPositionType('chronicler_court_position').GetName()] makes some final arrangements, I make my way to the archives. Bundles of scrolls lie in wait, far more than I could ever read in a single lifetime. The archives hold the long histories of the [dwarves|E].\n\nChief among them accounts of the seven [dwarffathers|E] and their incarnations, who are believed to return to life until each has lived seven times.\n\nThen there are others who made a name for themselves among the seven clans, whether for honour or infamy."

 ancestor_veneration.0011.desc: "The first of the [dwarffathers|E], [durindeathless|E], was shaped by [mahalcharacter|E] during the [dwarfcreation|E] and awoke after the awakening of [elves|E] and [men|E], beneath the northern reaches of the [mistymountains|E]. He was the forefather of the [longbeards|E].\n\nThe accounts of his reincarnations must be many, and I marvel at how his spirit has survived through all time."
 ancestor_veneration.0011.a: "Let us turn to the stories of Durin's feats..."
 ancestor_veneration.0011.b: "On second thought..."

 ancestor_veneration.0012.t: "Incarnations of Úri the Scarred"
 ancestor_veneration.0012.desc: "One of the [dwarffathers|E], [uriscarred|E] was shaped by [mahalcharacter|E] during the [dwarfcreation|E] and awoke after the awakening of [elves|E] and [men|E], in the [west|E] beside [dwalinwise|E] of the [broadbeams|E]. He was the forefather of the [firebeards|E].\n\nWhat chronicles might exist of his repeated lives, and how his essence has withstood the passing ages?"
 ancestor_veneration.0012.a: "The time has come to recount the deeds of Úri..."
 ancestor_veneration.0012.b: "On second thought..."

 ancestor_veneration.0013.t: "Incarnations of Dwálin the Wise"
 ancestor_veneration.0013.desc: "One of the [dwarffathers|E], [dwalinwise|E] was shaped by [mahalcharacter|E] during the [dwarfcreation|E] and awoke after the awakening of [elves|E] and [men|E], in the [west|E] beside [uriscarred|E] of the [firebeards|E]. He was the forefather of the [broadbeams|E], .\n\nI cannot help but wonder what tales are told of his incarnations, and how his spirit has endured through the ages."
 ancestor_veneration.0013.a: "It's time to unfold the chronicles of Dwálin..."

He was the forefather of the [ironfists|E].\n\nI find myself contemplating the histories of his incarnations and the lasting endurance of his soul."
 ancestor_veneration.0014.a: "Let the tales of Sindri's exploits be told..."
 ancestor_veneration.0014.b: "On second thought..."

 ancestor_veneration.0015.t: "Incarnations of Thúlin the Swift"

He was the forefather of the [stiffbeards|E].\n\nTales of his many lives surely abound, and I wonder how his spirit remains unbroken through the ages."
 ancestor_veneration.0015.a: "Now we turn our gaze to the legacy of Thúlin..."
 ancestor_veneration.0015.b: "On second thought..."

 ancestor_veneration.0016.t: "Incarnations of Thrár the Proud"
 ancestor_veneration.0016.desc: "One of the [dwarffathers|E], [thrarproud|E] was shaped by [mahalcharacter|E] during the [dwarfcreation|E] and awoke after the awakening of [elves|E] and [men|E], in the [east|E] beside [bavorcold|E] of the [stonefoots|E]. He was the forefather of the [blacklocks|E].\n\nThe legends of his incarnations fascinate me, as does the resilience of his spirit across time."

He was the forefather of the [stonefoots|E].\n\nI often ponder the stories woven around his many incarnations and the strength of his enduring spirit."
 ancestor_veneration.0017.a: "It's time to unfold the legend of Bavór..."
 ancestor_veneration.0017.b: "On second thought..."

 ancestor_veneration.0018.t: "Dwarves of Great Renown"
 ancestor_veneration.0018.desc: "Beyond the tales of the seven [dwarffathers|E], the histories tell of many other [dwarves|E] of great significance from all seven clans. Warriors, craftsmen, kings, and explorers whose deeds have echoed through the ages, whether for honour, wisdom, or darker deeds.\n\nTheir lives and legacies have left deep marks on Dwarven history, shaping the fate of their people in ways both grand and subtle."
 ancestor_veneration.0018.a: "I shall study the great Dwarves of the seven clans..."

 ancestor_veneration.0101.t: "Ancestor Veneration: Durin I, the Deathless"
 ancestor_veneration.0101.desc: "The scroll speaks of [durindeathless|E], first of the [dwarves|E] to awaken, in [Glossary('Mazalabkân','mazalabkan_gloss')], beneath Mount [gunduzbad|E]. He was the eldest of the seven [dwarffathers|E], [dwarffather|E] of the [longbeards|E] and founded the House of [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofdurinI').GetDynasty.GetName]. Alone [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofdurinI').GetFirstName] journeyed through lands where none had walked, naming the hills and dells in a world still young, as the [songofdurin|E] recalls.\n\nIn time, Durin came to the Mirrormere, where strange stars crowned the water's surface — a sign, he believed, of his purpose. There he raised Durin's Stone and founded [khazaddum|E] above the lake, hewing halls from the mountain that would become the pride of all Dwarfkind.\n\nIn the deep places beneath [GetTitleByKey('k_khazad_dum').GetNameNoTier], he discovered [metal_mithril|E], and from this rare treasure he forged for himself Durin's Helm, a regal masked greathelm, which would become a famed heirloom of his people. He lived exceptionally long for a [dwarf|E] and passed some time before the [firstage|E]'s end. His tomb lies deep within Khazad-dûm."
 ancestor_veneration.0101.a: "May my deeds honour his memory."
 ancestor_veneration.0101.b: "He understood that distant roads bring hidden riches."
 ancestor_veneration.0101.c: "The mastery of his craft was a marvel to many."

 ancestor_veneration.0102.t: "Ancestor Veneration: Durin II"
 ancestor_veneration.0102.desc: "The scroll tells of [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofdurinII').GetFirstNameRegnal], ruling over [khazaddum|E] during a time of peace and power. [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofdurinII').GetFirstName] looked beyond the mountain halls and forged bonds with the neighbouring realm of [eregion|E].\n\nIn a rare gesture of trust, he entrusted the construction of the West-gate of [GetTitleByKey('k_khazad_dum').GetNameNoTier] to the artistry of both [dwarf|E] and [elf|E], commissioning [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofnarvi').GetFirstName], master craftsman of Khazad-dûm, and [celebrimbor|e], the Elven-lord of [eregion|E], to construct the [doorsofdurin|E], a collaboration that would foster a lasting friendship between Durin and Celebrimbor.\n\nDuring his visits to the city of [GetTitleByKey('c_ost_in_edhil').GetNameNoTier], mainly the district of [Glossary('Arost','arost_gloss')], where Durin had been granted [Glossary('Bar Durin','bar_durin_gloss')] by [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineoffeanor10').GetFirstName], Durin II delighted in experimenting with axe designs, refining forms that balanced function and beauty. With Celebrimbor's guidance, this culmination of craftsmanship led to the creation of Durin's Axe, a masterpiece adorned with intricate [ithildin|E] markings wrought by Celebrimbor himself. Like the creation of the Doors of Durin, this axe forever marked a rare moment of unity between the peoples of the Dwarves and Elves."
 ancestor_veneration.0102.a: "Let us honour Durin's wisdom and seek friendships beyond our halls."
 ancestor_veneration.0102.b: "The Longbeards needed no aid to find their fortune."

 ancestor_veneration.0103.t: "Ancestor Veneration: Durin III"
 ancestor_veneration.0103.desc: "The scroll speaks of [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofdurinIII').GetFirstNameRegnal], ruler of the [longbeards|E] in the [secondage|E], when the [dwarves|E] of [khazaddum|E] shared rare friendship with the [elves|E] of [eregion|E]. Guided by [annatarcharacter|E], 'the Lord of Gifts', the Elven-smiths under [celebrimbor|E] began forging the [ringsofpower|E]. Despite vicious rumours that it was [sauroncharacter|E] who bestowed the [Concept('sevenringsofdwarves', 'Ring of the Longbeards')|E] on [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofdurinIII').GetFirstName], scholars hold true that it was given by [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineoffeanor10').GetFirstName]. When the Dark Lord revealed his true purpose in [ageSA|E] 1695 and assailed [GetTitleByKey('k_eregion').GetNameNoTier], [gundabad|E], [eriador|E], and the [greymountains|E] with [orcs|E] and Savage [men|E] from the [east|E], Dwarven warriors marched to aid the Elves, but their defence proved unsuccessful. After the fall of [eregion|E] in S.A. 1697, the [doorsofdurin|E] were shut, sealing the western passage into [GetTitleByKey('k_khazad_dum').GetNameNoTier].\n\nBy S.A. 1698, [GetTitleByKey('d_gundabad').GetNameNoTier] too was lost, despite fierce resistance, and with the influx of Eastern Men and Orcs into the region, the Dwarf-road of Greenwood was no longer safely traversable, severing the [longbeards|E] from their kin in the [ironhills|E]. The [allianceofdwarvesandmen|E], forged in the early Second Age between [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofdurin3').GetFirstNameRegnal], grandson of [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofdurinI').GetFirstNameNicknamed], and [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofgundemar1').GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal] had long stood strong. Yet in the aftermath of the [waroftheelvesandsauron|E], the alliance was bloodied by grievous losses among the [northmen|E], including the death of their chieftain [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofolmondo9').GetFirstNameRegnal]. As the storm of war subsided, the [GetCultureByKey('dwergwine').GetCollectiveNoun] were left diminished and scattered, and the old alliance could no longer endure."
 ancestor_veneration.0103.a: "Sauron's treachery shall not be forgotten, nor left unavenged."
 ancestor_veneration.0103.b: "The Elves should have been warier of well-intentioned strangers."

 ancestor_veneration.0104.t: "Ancestor Veneration: Durin IV"
 ancestor_veneration.0104.desc: "The scroll describes [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofdurinIV').GetFirstNameRegnal], ruler of [khazaddum|E] and [dwarffather|E] of the [longbeards|E], who marched to war when [middleearth|E]'s doom was near and later managed to reclaim [gundabad|E], though only for the remainder of his life. At the end of the [secondage|E], he stood beside the greatest kings of [elves|E] and [men|E]. [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineoforodreth4').GetFirstName], [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineoforopher1').GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal], [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofamdir1').GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal] and [elendil|E] formed the [lastallianceshort|E] against the Shadow of [mordor|E], with the aid of [durinsfolk|E]. Shockingly, the [treacheryoforn|E] saw some of the [ironfists|E] join [sauroncharacter|E]'s cause, led by their King [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofsindri102').GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal], who secretly bartered warriors and weapons for the Dark Lord's gold.\n\nOne by one, the great kings fell: Oropher at Dagorlad, [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofanarion1').GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal] beneath [GetTitleByKey('c_barad_dur').GetNameNoTier], and Gil-galad and [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofelendil').GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal] in the final battle by [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofsauron').GetFirstName]'s might. In the chaos, [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineisildur0').GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal] picked up [narsil|E] and severed the [masterring|E] from Sauron's hand, destroying him. Durin IV was one of the few kings to survive the onslaught, while Ôrn perished amid the fighting, along with his hopes for wealth.\n\nIsildur thereafter sealed his own fate by keeping the Ring and was slain by [orcs|E] near the Anduin two years later, where [Concept('onering', 'Isildur’s Bane')|E] was lost to time."
 ancestor_veneration.0104.a: "Victory demands sacrifice. We must be ready to pay its price."

Sindri, wary but pragmatic, revised the customs of his forebears to permit such service on the strict condition that no oaths were sworn, no allegiance pledged, and no alliances made. Thus the principle of neutrality, once born of trade, was extended into mercenary toil.

Though already aged when Thrár returned to life, Bavór brought with him wisdom, strength, and the bonds of kinship.\n\nHis daughter [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofbavor14').GetFirstNameRegnal] wed Thrár, and he became First-Vassal and North-King of Bizarûldûm, a title of high honour, though he never sought prominence. Where Thrár desired greatness and held the highest title as the realm's appointed ruler, Bavór was his equal in counsel, guiding quietly to keep their people united.\n\nIt is said that when Bavór arrived, Thrár laughed and declared it just as things should be: two clans, and two friends, hand in hand. Rumour says that Bavór dryly remarked that he had little choice, lest Thrar end up running headlong into foolish danger which would lead to much grief. Their partnership formed the heart of early Bizarûldûm, not ruled by one over the other, but shaped by their differences and shared trust. The strength of their union outlasted them both."

When the other clans neared the secrets of iron, her brother [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofsindri0c').GetFirstNameRegnal] broke the ancient accords and seized the iron-rich hold of [GetTitleByKey('d_kheled_dum').GetNameNoTier] from its [stiffbeard|E] holder [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofthulin0cbrother').GetFirstNameRegnal]. In reply, the Stiffbeards, [blacklocks|E], and [stonefoots|E] formed a league, cut off trade, and uncovered the secrets for themselves. When the Ironfists demanded trade or threatened war, the league called for restitution.\n\nThus began the [warofiron|E]. The Ironfists were ultimately harshly defeated, severely underestimating their opposition and most were exiled to the Ered Harmal, and all three of Thrîs's brothers were killed in the war. This left her to rule what remained of their people, and her ascent marked an unprecedented moment - the first [dwarven|E] Queen in memory. Long opposed to the war, she made peace with the other three eastern clans, the exiled Ironfists viewed this act as dishonour. Upon her death, she was succeeded by her son [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofdhrim1').GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal] who was not of Sindri's line. In the years that followed, the royal seat of the Ironfists passed instead to the exiled [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofsindri0e').GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal], who founded [GetTitleByKey('k_kheled_nala').GetNameNoTier] with many of the other exiles."

Many craftsmen tried, and none succeeded. Tahm entered her court, declaring he would surpass the makers of Men, yet for many years he failed.\n\nAfter seven years of failed attempts, Tahm came into possession of an emerald of rarest quality. With it he fashioned a plain circlet of gold and silver, set with the stone at its brow. When the queen received it, she was satisfied at last, and witnesses swore the emerald gave off a faint light. After her death, or her supposed ascension, the circlet dimmed, and has never shone again. Tahm remained in her service for the rest of her reign, crafting many jewels, blades, and ornaments that became heirlooms of Khy of Old. After the queen's passing, he departed, and his fate is unknown. His works passed from hand to hand in later years, many lost, though fragments still appear in old tales.\n\nSome accounts praise him as a craftsman of rare skill whose work endured beyond his lifetime.

Though not alone, his courage stood apart. As others loosed arrows that could not pierce its hide, he scaled a ruined fortress and struck deep into its wing. The dragon fell, tearing off Hevdrok's arm and hurling him to the rubble. Yet Hevdrok rose once more. The half-blind beast mocked Hevdrok's missing arm, unaware of the axe he still wielded, until Hevdrok cleaved the Dragon's skull before succumbing.\n\nHis kin bore him to [Glossary('Kibiltumun','kibiltumun_gloss')] beneath [GetTitleByKey('k_kibilzahar').GetNameNoTier], the sole place from which the Stiffbeards believe [mahalcharacter|E] guides their dead to the Halls beyond.

Gorovôd had always been shy in his early life, but from that day, he lived for vengeance and refused to ever take off his helmet. He joined Thrár's campaigns not for honour or coin, but to see Goblin blood spilled.\n\nWhen the armies of [GetTitleByKey('e_bizaruldum').GetNameNoTier] returned home, Gorovôd did not.

### FALSE DWARF HISTORY ###

The accounts were copied from [elven|E] and [mannish|E] sources, and none of them agree with one another. One text describes a small and secretive people who carved hidden halls in the western mountains long before any of the seven [dwarffathersshort|E] stirred. Known as a stunted offshoot of our kind, the Petty-dwarves were cast out by their own kin for kinslaying, theft, and other grave crimes, and left to fend for themselves among the wild hills.\n\nA far more bitter account recalls the days when Elven hunters slew them on sight, forcing them into hiding and leaving only a few survivors like Mîm and his sons, who met tragic ends after the ruin of their last refuge. The most curious claim is that the Petty-dwarves were [mahalcharacter|E]'s first attempts at crafting children of stone, unfinished forms set aside once the true Fathers were made. The loremasters reject this interpretation, yet the old chronicler wrote as if he believed it absolutely.\n\nMy findings offer no certainty. Myth, slander, or forgotten truth, the fate of the Vanished Folk remains a riddle, as strange and sorrowful as the tales that remember them."
 ancestor_veneration.9000.a: "Let them entertain their curiosities."

It claims that [dwarves|E] do not wed, do not bear children, and do not pass their line from one generation to the next. Instead, they are said to 'spring fully formed from holes in the ground' like stones shaken loose by an earthquake. The storytellers cite the same reasoning: they never see Dwarf-women, and because females are so like the men in voice and appearance, they assume none exist. Some even insist the seven [dwarffathersshort|E] emerged this way, pushed up from the deep places of [ardaconcept|E] by the pressure of the living rock.\n\nTo our people, the idea is absurd. Yet the misconception is so widespread among Men that even their nobles repeat it with perfect seriousness. The archivists debate whether to correct the tale... or let it persist for the amusement of future generations."

 ancestor_veneration.9002.desc: "A strange tale has begun circulating from a local chronicler, eager to raise his family's name. He claims that his line descends not from any of the seven, but from an eighth [dwarffather|E] — a hidden ancestor [mahalcharacter|E] is said to have shaped and set to rest beneath the [GetTitleByKey('c_glittering_caves').GetNameNoTier] of Aglarond in the [whitemountains|E].\n\nAccording to the manuscript, this forgotten forefather was the smallest of the Dwarf-fathers, compact and sturdy, crafted to move unseen through the tightest seams of stone. The story describes him waking in a cradle of quartz and gemstones, teaching his kin to read the trembling of the mountain and hear the faint song in crystal veins, then vanishing back into the stone as quietly as he came.\n\nNo clan-lore records such a figure, and most of the runes the chronicler cites turn out to be decorative spirals found on cavern walls. Yet the caverns of Aglarond hold wonders beyond counting, and the thought that Mahal might have fashioned an eighth, forgotten father in some secret hour has captured the imagination of a few excitable scholars.\n\nIs this merely the boast of an ambitious scribe, or could there be a long-buried truth glimmering beneath the tale?"

According to the manuscript, the Ironfists were never loyal allies to their kin, eager to serve [sauroncharacter|E] and sow discord among other [dwarves|E].\n\nThe text is filled with moral judgements, dark illustrations of Ironfists in molten-eyed rage, and claims that their very hearts were twisted from birth to betray the Free Peoples. Archivists dismiss the work as slander, yet the meticulous detail and venomous tone make it a striking, if distasteful, piece of pseudo-history.\n\nNo evidence supports such a view, but it reveals the depth of grief and anger still lingering among those who fought the Shadow alongside Dwarves who now lie fallen."
 ancestor_veneration.9003.a: "An insult to our fathers — burn it at once."
 ancestor_veneration.9003.b: "A hateful fantasy, but a warning of past bitterness."

This group, whispered to descend from an eighth [dwarffather|E], is never confirmed and known only through the fanciful accounts of [men|E] who claim to have glimpsed strange figures moving high in the mountains, their identities obscured by distance and mist. Some descriptions alleged the figures went beardless and were adorned with odd markings across their skin, though such tales grew hazier with every retelling.\n\nThe scroll imagines their delves as marvels of craftsmanship, with glittering veins of ore, intricate halls, and silent corridors where each member could read the subtle tremors of the mountain. No Dwarf has ever claimed to meet them, and no lineage traces back to this supposed clan.\n\nSome scholars dismiss the tale as mere legend, inspired by misty sightings and tall stories. Others speculate that an eighth clan, or something like it, might still dwell unseen deep within."

He claims that, in ancient times, Dwarves wore no beards at all, shaving their faces clean in emulation of the beardless [numenoreans|E]. Another chapter suggests that braids were later introduced as a mark of youthful rebellion or defiance. Illustrations show smooth-chinned kings, their faces unnervingly bare, and young Dwarves sporting elaborate braids in protest.\n\nThe archivists are horrified; the beard is sacred, a gift bound to our very making.

According to the account, he possessed such charm and bearing that Elf maidens swooned and entire courts paused their councils just to observe him.\n\nThe illustrations are equally extravagant: Elves fainting into each other's arms, handkerchiefs fluttering to the ground, and instructions for grooming the Dwarf's hair to perfection. Every detail — the gleam of his beard, the sparkle of his eyes, even the shine of his boots - is described with astonishing care.\n\nWhether the story exaggerates, or whether the author harboured some private affection for his subject, the tale remains an amusing and entirely improbable account of a bond crossing the ancient divide between Dwarves and Elves."

The author supports this startling idea with elaborate, though clearly fabricated, genealogies, misread runes, and obscure prophecies, all suggesting that Dwarves were intended as instruments of the Shadow.\n\nYet the treatise insists the Dwarves' natural stubbornness and skill in battle represents rebellion against their creator: though supposedly formed to serve evil, they resisted every tyranny, fought [dragons|E] and Dark Lords alike, and preserved their craft and freedom. Margin notes depict Dwarves in their halls, scheming to defy the will of their supposed father. The manuscript reads like a cautionary fable, and yet its audacity is strangely compelling."
 ancestor_veneration.9008.a: "Absurd... yet I admire the Dwarves' eternal defiance."

Merchants tried to sell pieces of his golden beard, while adventurers sought to 'release' him, only to discover the gold could not be melted or chipped.\n\nThe author concludes with a moral about ambition and greed, though the text's practical reliability is, to say the least, questionable.

 ancestor_veneration.9014.desc: "A recent chronicle circulating among curious scholars offers a striking claim: that the seven [dwarffathersshort|E] were not only shaped by [mahalcharacter|E] but were hewn from a single, massive vein of living rock, carved in sequence to preserve a shared essence.\n\nThe text includes illustrations showing each Father emerging from the stone, their features and bearing echoing one another, as if the mountain itself imbued them with a common strength and will.\n\nThough the notion stretches credulity, it serves to highlight the unity and enduring kinship of the Fathers, even across time and distance."
 ancestor_veneration.9014.a: "Remarkable! Even their likeness binds them through the ages."
 ancestor_veneration.9014.b: "Perhaps all greatness springs from the same root, after all."
 
 ancestor_veneration.9015.t: "Fankil and the Wicked Dwarves"
 ancestor_veneration.9015.desc: "Among scattered chronicles is a sensational account of Fankil, a malevolent figure said to be a child of [melkorcharacter|E] who perverted [men|E] and allied with [goblins|E] and 'Wicked Dwarves'. According to the tale, these Wicked Dwarves, part of the Úvanimor, were bred from the earth by Melkor. They bore dark axes and blackened shields at the [battleofpalisor|E], fighting alongside Fankil's forces against the Ilkorindi (the [elves|E]).\n\nThe story describes Fankil's host spreading estrangement and chaos among Men and [dwarves|E] alike. In truth, however, the only Dwarves reliably known to have followed him were outcasts from the [orocarni|E] clans, criminals and exiles he tempted with promises of wealth and retribution against the kin who had wronged them.\n\nThe rest of the narrative is chaotic, contradictory, and at odds with every reliable record of the battle. The author seems more enamoured with fable than truth, delighting in the notion that Dwarves could betray the Free Peoples so dramatically."
 ancestor_veneration.9015.a: "Ridiculous! Such tales dishonour the memory of our kin."
 ancestor_veneration.9015.b: "Amusing, if only for the imagination of the author."

 ancestor_veneration.9016.t: "An Unprecedented Match"
 ancestor_veneration.9016.desc: "With a cheeky grin on [amused_researcher.GetHerHis] face, [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMeShort', SCOPE.sC('amused_researcher'))] [amused_researcher.GetTitledFirstName] shows me a curious chronicle of a [dwarf|E] and an [elf|E] maiden who met under extraordinary circumstances, far from their kin and courts. The tale describes their daring encounters in wild forests, across hidden mountain paths, and through ancient halls, each learning the ways of the other's people.\n\nThe manuscript interweaves romance and adventure, showing them sharing feasts, exchanging gifts, and standing together in peril, despite the skepticism of those around them. Timelines and genealogies are inconsistent, yet the charm of their improbable companionship is undeniable."
 ancestor_veneration.9016.a: "This explains so much about Dwarf-Elf interactions!"
 ancestor_veneration.9016.b: "A tale of daring, love, and impossibilities - how entertaining!"

 ancestor_veneration.9017.t: "The Dwarf-moot of the Tumbling Rings"
 ancestor_veneration.9017.desc: "A small, chaotic scroll recounts a [dwarf|E]-moot of kings that supposedly never took place. The narrative begins normally: The Dwarf-kings gather, each giving a quick summary of their realm's affairs. Everything goes smoothly, food and drink are served, and the assembly appears perfectly orderly. But suddenly, one of the dwarves serving the meal trips, trying to grab hold of the table, and rips the tablecloth down with him as he falls.\n\nWhat's sitting in a box on top of that table? That's right, the seven [sevenringsofdwarves|E]. They go rolling across the moot chamber's floor, and the next thing anyone sees is all seven dignified Dwarf-kings frantically diving for their respective Rings. Perhaps one of them shouts something about 'my precious' as chaos erupts around the council table.\n\nThe scroll winks at its readers that perhaps the kings themselves agreed afterward never to speak of this meeting again, for fear of revealing their greed and the folly of tumbling over each other while protecting their Rings."
 ancestor_veneration.9017.a: "Hilarious! Who knew history could be this entertaining?"
 ancestor_veneration.9017.b: "Not even the most dignified always maintain their composure."

 ancestor_veneration.9018.t: "The Hoarders' Curse"
 ancestor_veneration.9018.desc: "An eccentric parchment presented to me by my [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMeShort', SCOPE.sC('overenthusiastic_researcher'))] [overenthusiastic_researcher.GetTitledFirstName] claims that the first [dragons|E] were not born of the malice of [morgothcharacter|E], but of [dwarves|E] who succumbed to a terrible curse. According to the scribe, these Dwarves hoarded gold beyond all reason, their souls twisting under the weight of greed until their bodies reshaped themselves into scaled, winged beasts. Their minds, he insists, remained dimly aware of their origins, which is why Dragons forever hunger for Dwarven treasure: they are reclaiming what was once theirs.\n\nThe manuscript cites wild stories of hoard-keepers who vanished overnight, of chambers found claw-scarred and molten as if their owner had simply... changed. Naturally, not a single reputable chronicler corroborates any of this, and the work reads more like a moral fable than a record of history — a warning that greed devours the greedy until nothing recognisable remains."
 ancestor_veneration.9018.a: "Utter nonsense — a Dwarf can never have too much gold."
 ancestor_veneration.9018.b: "Dragons as fallen Dwarves? Absurd… but strangely compelling."

 ancestor_veneration.9019.t: "From Hardy Beards to Hairy Feet"
 ancestor_veneration.9019.desc: "My [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMeShort', SCOPE.sC('amused_researcher'))] [amused_researcher.GetTitledFirstName] arrives with a curious treatise brimming with cheerful marginal doodles and an argument so audacious it leaves me nearly speechless. The scroll states that [hobbits|E] are, in fact, a dwindled offshoot of the 'Petty-dwarves' from tales of elder days who lost the ability to grow beards - and somehow shifted this ancestral pride to the hair upon their feet.\n\nThe anonymous author claims their fondness for hearth-fires, hole-homes, and hearty meals springs from 'proto-[dwarven|E] instincts', and insists their fascination with buried things, from seedlings to tubers, is the faint echo of a forgotten delving tradition.\n\nEvery point is stitched together from happenstance and homely sayings, yet the earnestness and sheer absurdity make it difficult not to smile."
 ancestor_veneration.9019.a: "A daring thesis — misguided, but certainly memorable."
 ancestor_veneration.9019.b: "Imagine it... Hobbits as beardless cousins. Delightfully ridiculous."

 ancestor_veneration.9020.t: "The Broadbeam Implication"
 ancestor_veneration.9020.desc: "An ancient treatise, written with great confidence but little discernment, attempts to prove that both clans of the [bluemountains|E], [firebeards|E] and [broadbeams|E], took part in the [nauglamir|E] incident and the slaying of [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('lineofelwe1').GetFirstName]. The [elvish|E] author leans heavily on vague phrasing like 'the [dwarf|E]-smiths of the [eredluin|E]' or 'the Dwarves of [nogrod|E] and [belegost|E]', insisting this must refer to both peoples equally.\n\nTo make the claim fit, the writer twists trade logs, misreads travel accounts, and even suggests that Broadbeams 'might have dyed their beards' to blend in with their Firebeard kin — an argument so preposterous it borders on comedy, given the unmistakable red hair of every Firebeard.\n\nThe treatise is clearly misguided, yet its very existence illustrates how easily foreign scholars conflate all Dwarves when they cannot be bothered to distinguish one clan from another."
 ancestor_veneration.9020.a: "Preposterous. Our history is not theirs to rewrite."
 ancestor_veneration.9020.b: "Elven scribes... always simplifying what they do not understand."
