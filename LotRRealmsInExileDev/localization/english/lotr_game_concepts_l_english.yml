[gondor|E] grew in might and power and for a time was as [numenor|E] of old, but it now has long declined, though still strong. \n\nThe Elves became ever more concerned with conserving what lands they already held, and generally ceased attempting to expand. The Dwarves continued to prosper in their mountain halls until the fall of [khazaddum|E], when Durin's Bane awoke and slayed Durin VI, leading to the eventual foundation of the [ereborrealm|E]. \n\nIn the dwindling days of the Third Age, [sauroncharacter|E] prepared again to strike the Free Peoples, and hope rested on the edge of the knife.

'High-Lord', Targon was from a young age imperious and intelligent in equal measure, and from his youth bristled at the power and haughtiness of the Cardolani noble houses. Since the time of Cardolan's independence, and even long before, the nobility had held great autonomy and power, such that often the King of Cardolan was but 'first among equals'. Targon looked on with envy to the power and centralization enjoyed by the Kings of nearby Arthedain, whose pious and loyal vassals gave obescience happily. Thus, even before he ascended the throne, he aimed to push his father towards centralizing the rule of Cardolan and reducing the privileges and autonomy of the ancient noble houses. Unsurprisingly, this earned him significant emnity from many of the noble houses of Cardolan, who swiftly grew to fear what would come to pass when he ascended the throne.\n\nThus it came to pass that upon his ascension, factions of nobility headed by his two younger brothers both rose in revolt against him. With only the central lands of Cardolan remaining loyal to him (as his projects as a prince to improve the status of the crownlands had won him great acclaim there), it seemed likely that if his brothers united against him, he would fall. But Targon had won the admiration of many an ambitious and capable young man, and so was surrounded by a group of capable advisors and lieutenants. With this loyal council behind him, Targon managed to draw out the Cardolani civil war, forcing a stalemate. After six years of indecisive warfare, Targon's supporters gained the upper hand by a diplomatic masterstroke - convincing the Kingdom of Arthedain to enter the war in support of him. With the aid of Arthedain over the next 3 years, Targon's first brother, Turendur, was slain in battle, and the second, Caldamir, was forced to flee into the wilds of Rhudaur, whence he was never heard from again. \n\nHis throne thus secured, Targon set about humbling the rebellious nobility, stripping them of many of the privileges and autonomy they once had enjoyed. Some of the lesser noble houses forfeited their statuses entirely, becoming little more than peasants. However, this harsh decision would spell the end of his house, as years after his own death, Targon's grandson and granddaughter would die at the hands of a dispossesed house he stripped of their former lands, putting an end to the line of Thorondor in Cardolan."

Yet it would not be so. \n\nAs the years continued on, while the ring gave all these things to Khamûl, he also began to become cruel and capricious. He became more reclusive, and arbitrary in his decrees and acts, alienating nobility, clergy, and peasantry alike. Khamûl's reign as Hionvor began its end when he expelled all [numenorean|E] traders and diplomats from [womawas_drus|E].

Foreseeing the ruin upon the realm if he was not opposed, his cousin rallied the people, and a palace coup was initiated. The priests of Utumkôdur roused her from her slumber (which was not done save at utmost need), and Utumkôdur sanctioned the deposition of Khamûl and the attainment of all his descendants from lordship over her children. Barely managing to flee, Khamûl swore one day to return to Wômawas Drûs and exact vengeance on the kingdom which had spurned him. \n\nAfter this, Khamûl became a potent lieutenant for [sauroncharacter|E].

Upon meeting a delegation from the Eriadorim on the Tower Hills the sailors were delighted to discover that they were their kin, descendants of the forefathers of the Númenóreans who had never crossed the [eredluin|E]. Over the following centuries many Númenóreans came among these Edainic peoples, bringing knowledge and aid, and some few seem even to have found wives and settled.\n\nRelations with the native population in the Gwathló valley was far less successful, in part due to the Númenóreans’ exploitative forestry practices, and in part due to their failure to recognise the Gwaithurim population as Edanic kin. The string of river-forts built by the Guild of Venturers to protect their timber operations often came under attack by these natives. All this was swept away by [sauroncharacter|E]’s invasion of Eriador in S.A. 1695. The forests and the river forts were burned together, and the few surviving natives driven into hidden refuges. The legacy of this destruction and troubled history meant that for long years Minhiriath and the Gwathló valley would not be seen as a desirable place to settle, but merely as a conduit.\n\nThe Númenórean intervention in Eriador during the [waroftheelvesandsauron|E] marked a decisive shift in policy towards [middleearth|E]. They were hungry for lands to settle and exploit, and considerable numbers began to settle in the northlands, now near-emptied of the Edanic Eriadorim due to the massacres of Sauron.

They held the great barrows of their forefathers in the Tyrn Gorthad and Nelvorin with reverence. Likewise they had great sympathy for the plight of their Edainic kin, some few of whom had survived in hidden refuges in the Hills of Evendim and the Weather Hills. As these Eriadorim grew again in number and expanded out into the lowlands they mingled freely with the Númenóreans until they became nearly indistinguishable from them.\n\nNot wishing to impose on the Elves of Lindon, the earliest Númenórean settlers in this period had sailed up the Baranduin as far as Sarn Ford, but the shallow river made this impossible for any ships save for those of the smallest draught. In S.A. 1800 Vinyalondë was refounded as the haven of Lond Daer, followed by Tharbad in 1912 along with the great north road, and settlers thereafter mainly used the Gwathló to reach the interior of Eriador."

 game_concept_eriadorcolonisationsecondphase_desc:0 "As the lands further north became densely populated a second period of settlement began (S.A. c.2300-3000) in which many newcomers began to settle in Minhiriath until it was also a well-populated land. Lond Daer and Tharbad, which during the earlier phase of colonisation had been little more than minor havens and entrepots, became substantial settlements and administrative centres. After the foundation of Pelargir in S.A. 2350 as the chief haven of the [faithfulshort|E], more pious and impecunious emigrants tended to choose the Anduin Vale to settle, and with the growing alienation from the Elves that began in the 19th century of the [secondage|E], many of those who instead chose Minhiriath were in some part tainted by the beliefs of the [kingsmen|E] and became imperious and domineering, ruling through great landed estates. This distinction from their yeoman-like and more solidly-faithful northern kin was one seed of the emergence of an independent [cardolan|E] in the [thirdage|E].\n\nAlso unlike the informal and self-governing settlements of northern Eriador, which were largely ignored once the King’s Men asserted control in Armenelos, Minhiriath became an official colony of Númenor. However, the power of the governor based at Tharbad was ever in flux, with only those with the approval of the Lords of Andunië able to exert any degree of meaningful power. More often than not the position became a dumping ground for rejects from the court at [armenelos|E]."

These they found in the northeast, where a small Númenórean elite subjugated the Hillmen tribes and showed little inclination to aid or assimilate them. The resulting resentments, having brewed for long centuries, would later be exploited by the [witchkingshort|E].\n\nExcepting the north-east, the final centuries before the [downfallofnumenor|E] were therefore a period of quiet consolidation in the largely-Faithful territories of Eriador. They could do little but quietly protest in response to their growing horror at the changes being wrought in [numenor|E] itself. In the final years before the Downfall, Armenelos attempted to exert additional control over Minihirath in order to extract resources for the Great Armament and appointed a King’s Man governor. This led to a brief armed struggle with the local Faithful trading guilds, who resented their ancient privileges being interfered with, resulting in the governor being deposed and the old Faithful governor restored. Armenelos was too distracted by events elsewhere to intervene."

In this way they amassed much wealth, which they brought back to Númenor. \n\nBecause the Shadow lay heavy upon their hearts, the King's Men greatly feared Death and "sought to delay it by all means that they could". These attempts to escape their fate actually brought death upon them sooner, and the lifespans of their Kings waned. They filled the land of [numenor|E] with great tombs to preserve the memory of their dead, and their lives became ever more decadent: to ease their fears, they "drank and they feasted and they clad themselves in silver and gold". \n\nThe [akallabeth|E] was brought about by the decadence and hubris of the King's Men, and after the [downfallofnumenor|E], the King's Men suffered a perilous decline in their former colonial possessions.

While notably failing once (leading to dreadful civil war), on the whole this system has been successful in keeping the family unified and prosperous.\n\nThe Invocate also takes an unabashed interest in improving the bloodlines of the Tumakveh.

The exact cause of the war has been lost to time, but the result was Arthedain formally declaring war upon Cardolan and crossing the Baranduin at Sarn Forn, while simultaneously laying siege to Minas Mallost in Tyrn Hadhoth.\n\nDuring the war, the Cardolani capital of Thalion would see its first sack by triumphant Arthedainian forces. After this event, [rhudaur|E] entered the war, assailing both Cardolan and Arthedain. After over a decade of ruinous warfare, peace would be established by the Treaty of Faelond, with Tyrn Hadhoth ceded to Arthedain and Dyr Maenason to Rhudaur.\n\nDespite pretentions and oaths of eternal friendship, war would return to the successor kingdoms in T.A. 1001 during the [waroftherestoration|E]."

The war's outbreak was predated by the alliance formed between the newly ascended King Cirion of [cardolan|E] and the warrior-king Elenthorn of [rhudaur|E].\n\nThe two kingdoms united assailed the borders of Arthedain, and saw great success on the field. However, a successful heroic defense of the Weather Hills by Prince Mallor of Arthedain saw the campaign lose momentum and die down to low level engagements and raiding. After several years of this, the sides came to an agreement brokered by Imladris: Arthedain would return the Barrow-downs to Cardolan and pay a great war-ransom to Rhudaur, but there would be no concessions on the issue of the Weather-hills, which both Cardolan and Rhudaur still laid claim to. In exchange for these concessions, Cardolan and Rhudaur both swore to build no new fortifications on the Arthedainian border for 50 years, and both would reduce tariffs that had been placed on Arthedanian traders after [twelveyearwar|El]."

The war was rooted in opposition to the ascension of King Targon, who desired to centralize the kingship and curtail the privileges and power of the proud Cardolani nobility. Targon was opposed by two factions led by his younger brothers, Maeron and Caldamir. Maeron had the support of the south and coastal regions, whereas Caldamir had the support of the north-east as well as aid from some of the [dunedain|E] lords of [rhudaur|E].\n\nAfter six years of indecisive war, Targon gained the upper hand by the intervention of [arthedain|E] in support of his rule. The war lasted for 3 more years, with Maeron dying in combat and Caldamir fleeing into Rhudaur, where he was lost to history.\n\nThe aftermath would see the rebellious nobility of Cardolan humbled, but also set the seeds of Cardolan's later decline and the end of Targon's own dynasty, with his son being the last King of Cardolan."

Eventually the coalition forces of Arthedain, Cardolan, Lindon and Saralain under the newly crowned King Araphor were able to stop the advance through Cardolan at three decisive battles: the Battle of the Crossings at Sarn Ford, the Battle of the Keep at Argond, and the Battle of the Downs at Minas Mollost. Even with these pyrrhic triumphs, it would take two more years for all of Angmar's now scattered forces to be hunted down and rooted out of Cardolan, with the last army being destroyed outside Barad Girithlin in 1411.\n\nThe Devastation would leave permanent and drastic impacts on Cardolan. Though still held by the [dunedain|E] until the later Great Plague, Cardolan was substantially depopulated and its infrastructure greatly damaged. Many of the [dunedain|E] of the region chose to either migrate to Arthedain or move closer to its border, with governance of the region being shifted away from the old Princely capital of Argond towards a governorship stationed in Iarond."

Possessing brilliant emerald leaves and dark bark, even once cut a bough from this tree would long hold its color and vitality, with some boughs known to last for years. Because of this, they became a key part of the tradition of the mariners of [numenor|E], whose female relatives or spouses would place a bough of Oiolairë upon their ships as a symbol of endurance and good fortune, as well as the friendship and protection of [ossecharacter|E] and [uinencharacter|E].
