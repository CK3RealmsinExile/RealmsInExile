The Dwarves continued to prosper in their mountain halls until the fall of [khazaddum|E], when Durin's Bane awoke and slayed Durin VI, leading to the eventual foundation of the [ereborrealm|E]. \n\nIn the dwindling days of the Third Age, [sauroncharacter|E] prepared again to strike the Free Peoples, and hope rested on the edge of the knife.

'High-Lord', Targon was from a young age imperious and intelligent in equal measure, and from his youth bristled at the power and haughtiness of the Cardolani noble houses. Since the time of Cardolan's independence, and even long before, the nobility had held great autonomy and power, such that often the King of Cardolan was but 'first among equals'. Targon looked on with envy to the power and centralization enjoyed by the Kings of nearby Arthedain, whose pious and loyal vassals gave obeisance happily. Thus, even before he ascended the throne, he aimed to push his father towards centralizing the rule of Cardolan and reducing the privileges and autonomy of the ancient noble houses. Unsurprisingly, this earned him significant enmity from many of the noble houses of Cardolan, who swiftly grew to fear what would come to pass when he ascended the throne.\n\nThus it came to pass that upon his ascension, factions of nobility headed by his two younger brothers both rose in revolt against him. With only the central lands of Cardolan remaining loyal to him (as his projects as a prince to improve the status of the crownlands had won him great acclaim there), it seemed likely that if his brothers united against him, he would fall. But Targon had won the admiration of many an ambitious and capable young man, and so was surrounded by a group of capable advisors and lieutenants. With this loyal council behind him, Targon managed to draw out the Cardolani civil war, forcing a stalemate. After six years of indecisive warfare, Targon's supporters gained the upper hand by a diplomatic masterstroke - convincing the Kingdom of Arthedain to enter the war in support of him. With the aid of Arthedain over the next 3 years, Targon's first brother, Turendur, was slain in battle, and the second, Caldamir, was forced to flee into the wilds of Rhudaur, whence he was never heard from again. \n\nHis throne thus secured, Targon set about humbling the rebellious nobility, stripping them of many of the privileges and autonomy they once had enjoyed. Some of the lesser noble houses forfeited their statuses entirely, becoming little more than peasants. However, this harsh decision would spell the end of his house, as years after his own death, Targon's grandson and granddaughter would die at the hands of a dispossessed house he stripped of their former lands, putting an end to the line of Thorondor in Cardolan."

From his youth, Pharazôn proved himself a dynamic and energetic captain and commander of men, and the champion of the [numenoreans|E]. He spent many years fighting in the [numenorean|E] colonies in [middleearth|E], often against [sauroncharacter|E]'s puppets and dominions.\n\nPharazôn returned to [numenor|E] during the final years of his uncle's life after the early death of his own father. There he took up the position of leader of the [kingsmen|E]. He was most generous with the wealth he had won in [middleearth|E], and won the hearts of the [numenorean|E] people. However, in truth Pharazôn was a moderate in the divide of the [kingsmen|E] and the [faithful|E], on account of his old and deep friendship to Amandil, heir to the Lordship of Andunië and leadership of the [faithful|E]. However, Pharazôn held his uncle as a weak and misguided king, whose fretting over matters of faith and philosophy had almost led the empire to ruin. He also viewed his cousin Miriel as unready and too weak to be the ruler the [numenoreans|E] required.\n\nAfter the death of Tar-Palantir, Pharazôn seized the throne for himself in a bloodless coup, wedding his cousin Miriel and christening her in [adunaic|E] Ar-Zimraphel. Some have claimed the affixation of the royal 'Ar' to Miriel's [adunaic|E] name of Zimraphel was a sign of his recognition of her royal claim, and that she ruled alongside him. A few even say that she willingly ceded the throne, wed, and loved him. But far more believe he did so by force, and there was little love.\n\nFor many years Ar-Pharazôn reigned as the mightiest King [numenor|E] had yet seen. Yet his ruin was to come. For he heard that [sauroncharacter|E] claimed the title 'King of Men', and in his wrath Pharazôn assembled a great host to humble him. Landing at [umbar|E], Pharazôn marched north and sent forth his heralds, commanding Sauron do obeisance to him. So great was the power of the [numenoreans|E] that [sauroncharacter|E]'s followers deserted him. Taking comely form, [sauroncharacter|E] offered himself as a hostage to the proud King. Yet here was the great trap.\n\nIn less than three years, Sauron rose from captive to counselor, the chief advisor of the King. He whispered poison into the heart of the [numenoreans|E] and their king. He convinced them to abandon Eru and worship [morgothcharacter] in his stead, and to make sacrifices to him in a great Temple built in Armenelos. As he grew old, Pharazôn grew fearful of death, and so Sauron convinced him to make war upon the [valargods|E], breaking the [banofthevalar|E] to invade [valinor|E] itself. This was the Great Armament, and through it came the [downfallofnumenor|E], in which Ar-Pharazôn perished."

Lond Hallacar) and to maintain control over the hinterlands of Pél and the [numenorean|E] tributary kingdoms there. The colony prospered greatly from the tribute that it received from its tributaries, and the tariffs it imposed on trade, as it had an advantageous position between the Eastern trade routes and the Western trade routes of [ardaconcept|E]. It would also receive many of the ships from Ardinâk when the island fell in S.A. 2548, sharing the responsibility of the eastern Númenórean fleet with Anarikê, which gained them prestige and wealth. However, Lôni Hîsekhôr was not as thoroughly settled as the other colonies of the [thanihazad|E], with the few Númenórean settlers forming the elite of the colony, ruling over the local Pél people, which would cause some cultural friction.\n\nWhen Tantûrak rebelled in the later [secondage|E] with aid from the Empire of Mûmakan, they dismembered the Republic of Kôronânde, bringing most of the south in league with them, and hostile to [numenor|E], causing trade to come to a halt, damaging Lôni Hîsekhôr source of revenue.

This left them in a precarious situation following the [akallabeth|E], as there was not the manpower nor the will to rebuild the city. This caused the Númenórean colonial elite of the city to relocate to the western Thâni-Hazâd, leaving the ancient city as a ruin.\n\nFollowing the [akallabeth|E], the ancient [colony|E] of Lôni Hîsekhôr lay abandoned for centuries. Eventually, the former tributary kingdoms of Pél, now independent, gave the name Arpél to the ancient ruins. However, during the domination of the twin crowns of Mag and Tûmag, the ancient ruins were renamed to Katerre, and utilised as a natural harbour to ensure their control over the Pél people and their continued subjugation.\n\nThis all changed in T.A. 1203, when a coalition of Pél rebels invited the [balan_lai|E] to aid them in their rebellion in exchange for fealty under their authority, though under their terms and with significant autonomy. This surprised the Balân-lâi, as they had long held the belief that Pél was a land better left independent, as it was too isolated and underdeveloped to be worth ruling. However, after much deliberation, it was agreed that they would aid the rebels, and in exchange, an [adunaic|E] noble would take the mantle of Prince of Pél. Thus the Balân-lâi aided the rebels, and Sapazûr Agathôhin, a supposed descendant of an old colonial noble of Lôni Hîsekhôr and of no connection to the other Kharadûnai dynasties was chosen as Prince. Lôni Hîsekhôr was afterwards rebuilt, although the name of Arpél had gained much popularity, it was decided to utilise the old colonial name as well, to appease the Kharadûnaic princes that had sent supplies and soldiers to kick out the twin crowns of Mag and Tûmag.\n\nThe newly rebuilt Arpél would house the Council of Pél, in which all the tribes of the Princedom would send a representative to govern alongside the Adûnaic prince. This meant that the new Princedom, and its capital, would stay away from the intrigue and conflicts of the [thanihazad|E].

King Tainalânn came to investigate the seemingly cursed isle, and though he slew the beast, he was slain in turn. And in its death throes it laid a ruinous curse on the isle, and the Kinn-lai fled.\n\nLong years later in the [secondage|E] came the [numenoreans|E], who claimed the isle for their own. The Númenóreans established Ardinâk as a naval outpost, and in time, it grew in might, casting the shadow of their dominion over much of the northeastern reaches of the Bay of Ûsakan. Upon the island, they raised the citadel of Ardinâk, also called the Shân-ta-Rhôn, a stronghold wrought from black marble and steel, a symbol of [numenor|E]'s strength and mastery of the seas.\n\nYet doom befell Ardinâk. In the year S.A. 1888, a great and terrible plague swept over the island, laying low its people. Those who could fled to the mainland, while others perished in agony, leaving the once-proud citadel abandoned to ruin. From that time forth, Ardinâk was deemed accursed by all who heard the tale of its fall. The Númenórean colony of Tantûrak, which had once held the navy's power, fell into decline, for the fleet was withdrawn and sent either to Anarikê or to Zimrathâni. Tantûrak, bereft of its former importance, grew neglected, and its loyalty to the motherland of Númenor waned with the passing of years."

The Kinn-lai were irreconcilably divided, and the coming of Men further aggravated the issue. \n\nTûlanal had gained the friendship of the great young Chief of the incoming Men - Amâv. And Tûlanal used this friendship as an example of why he should lead them. For her part, Shelepinn argued that he lightly gave away their ancient homelands in exchange for a friendship that would die with Amâv. Both would ultimately be proven right - while long did the Kîrani maintain friendship, the Mûmakani in time fell back into the Shadow which even then lurked over them.\n\nIt seemed to all that blood would be shed, when at last Shelepinn proved herself the nobler, saying that she would take those who would follow her and build a realm her own, away from her brother's.

Compared to the [dwarves|E] they are a bit shorter and less stout or stocky. \n\nEarly in their recorded history, Hobbits were divided into three kinds with different customs and temperaments. The Stoors grew facial hair and had an affinity for water, boats and swimming and wore boots; the Fallohides were fair, tall and slim, an adventurous people, friendlier and more open to outsiders. Finally, the Harfoots were the most numerous and instituted the living in burrows. In later days the Harfoot traits became the "norm".\n\nThe Hobbits are first known to have dwelled in the Vales of [anduin|E]. Some remained there, but the majority migrated westward, eventually coming to settle in the Shire during the reign of Argeleb II of Arthedain. \n\nHobbits have a life span somewhat longer than Men of non-[numenorean|E] descent, averaging between 90 and 100 years. The time at which a young hobbit "comes of age" is 33. \n\nHobbits are by nature of gentle disposition, though often provincial in outlook; they are fond of an unadventurous, bucolic life of farming, eating, smoking pipe-weed, socializing, and talking about genealogies. Yet do not underestimate them, for they are hardy in times of trial and show a fierce resolve when roused.\n\n#TOLKIENQUOTE "I am in fact a Hobbit (in all but size).

Further marriages between the two royal lines of Bizarûldûm made them all but indistinguishable to those within the Vale of Bizarûldûm. Towards the end of the [secondage|E], the Blacklock line perished due to a dragon attack, and the throne of Bizarûldûm passed to their cousins in the royal Stonefoots line. \n\nThe royal Blacklock branch ruling Nargubraz contested this, claiming that they should have inherited the rule of Bizarûldûm. As a result, the Blacklocks were split between those who supported King Fulla of Bizarûldûm (typically those Blacklocks who lived in Bizarûldûm) and the Blacklock line led by Bhrâli of Rûrumakh (typically those Blacklocks living outside Bizarûldûm).\n\nSeeing a chance to subvert one of the mightiest realms of the Dwarves, Sauron offered his aid to Bhrâli in exchange for a future favor, making him swear upon the ring the Blacklocks had received from him long ago. Nargubraz and Bizarûldûm made war upon each other, but the Last Alliance and Sauron's defeat there resulted in the war ending inconclusively. However, the two clans were sundered as a result of this, with only the Blacklocks and Stonefoots within Bizarûldûm itself remaining friendly to their brother-clan.\n\nIn T.A. 2063, Sauron fled into the East from Dol Guldur.

 game_concept_eriadorcolonisation_desc:0 "[numenorean|E] sailors first reached [lindon|E] in [ageSA|E] 600. The news spread swiftly, and Men in [eriador|E] were filled with wonder. Upon meeting a delegation from the Eriadorim on the Tower Hills, the sailors were delighted to discover that they were their kin, descendants of the forefathers of the Númenóreans who had never crossed the [eredluin|E]. Over the following centuries, many Númenóreans came among these Edainic peoples, bringing knowledge and aid, and some few seem even to have found wives and settled.\n\nRelations with the native population in the Gwathló valley were far less successful, in part due to the Númenóreans’ exploitative forestry practices and in part due to their failure to recognise the Gwaithurim population as Edanic kin. The string of river-forts built by the Guild of Venturers to protect their timber operations often came under attack by these natives. All this was swept away by [sauroncharacter|E]’s invasion of Eriador in S.A. 1695. The forests and the river forts were burned together, and the few surviving natives were driven into hidden refuges. The legacy of this destruction and troubled history meant that for long years Minhiriath and the Gwathló valley would not be seen as a desirable place to settle, but merely as a conduit.\n\nThe Númenórean intervention in Eriador during the [waroftheelvesandsauron|E] marked a decisive shift in policy towards [middleearth|E]. They were hungry for lands to settle and exploit, and considerable numbers began to settle in the northlands, now near-emptied of the Edanic Eriadorim due to the massacres of Sauron. In this they were encouraged by Gil-galad, whose nominal authority in Eriador was retained but who recognised the value of a strong buffer between Lindon and the darkness in the east.\n\nThere were three key phases of colonisation:\n\n[eriadorcolonisationfirstphase|E]\n\n[eriadorcolonisationsecondphase|E]\n\n[eriadorcolonisationthirdphase|E]"

 game_concept_eriadorcolonisationfirstphase_desc:0 "The earliest Númenórean settlements (S.A. c.1730-c.2300) were in the upper Baranduin Vale, on the shores of Lake Nennuial, and between the Lhûn and the Emyn Uial. This they did to be close to the [elves|E] of Lindon, but also because those lands had until recently been well-tilled and tamed by the Eriadorim under their own tutelage. They held the great barrows of their forefathers in the Tyrn Gorthad and Nelvorin with reverence. Likewise, they had great sympathy for the plight of their Edainic kin, some few of whom had survived in hidden refuges in the Hills of Evendim and the Weather Hills. As these Eriadorim grew again in number and expanded out into the lowlands, they mingled freely with the Númenóreans until they became nearly indistinguishable from them.\n\nNot wishing to impose on the Elves of Lindon, the earliest Númenórean settlers in this period had sailed up the Baranduin as far as Sarn Ford, but the shallow river made this impossible for any ships save for those of the smallest draught. In S.A. 1800, Vinyalondë was refounded as the haven of Lond Daer, followed by Tharbad in 1912, along with the great north road, and settlers thereafter mainly used the Gwathló to reach the interior of Eriador."

 game_concept_eriadorcolonisationsecondphase_desc:0 "As the lands further north became densely populated, a second period of settlement began (S.A. c. 2300-3000) in which many newcomers began to settle in Minhiriath until it was also a well-populated land. Lond Daer and Tharbad, which during the earlier phase of colonisation had been little more than minor havens and entrepots, became substantial settlements and administrative centres. After the foundation of Pelargir in S.A. 2350 as the chief haven of the [faithful|E], more pious and impecunious emigrants tended to choose the Anduin Vale to settle, and with the growing alienation from the Elves that began in the 19th century of the [secondage|E], many of those who instead chose Minhiriath were in some part tainted by the beliefs of the [kingsmen|E] and became imperious and domineering, ruling through great landed estates. This distinction from their yeoman-like and more solidly-faithful northern kin was one seed of the emergence of an independent [cardolan|E] in the [thirdage|E].\n\nAlso unlike the informal and self-governing settlements of northern Eriador, which were largely ignored once the King’s Men asserted control in Armenelos, Minhiriath became an official colony of Númenor. However, the power of the governor based at Tharbad was ever in flux, with only those with the approval of the Lords of Andunië able to exert any degree of meaningful power.

These they found in the northeast, where a small Númenórean elite subjugated the Hillmen tribes and showed little inclination to aid or assimilate them. The resulting resentments, having brewed for long centuries, would later be exploited by the [witchkingshort|E].\n\nExcepting the northeast, the final centuries before the [downfallofnumenor|E] were therefore a period of quiet consolidation in the largely Faithful territories of Eriador. They could do little but quietly protest in response to their growing horror at the changes being wrought in [numenor|E] itself. In the final years before the Downfall, Armenelos attempted to exert additional control over Minihirath in order to extract resources for the Great Armament and appointed a King’s Man governor. This led to a brief armed struggle with the local Faithful trading guilds, who resented their ancient privileges being interfered with, resulting in the governor being deposed and the old Faithful governor restored.

In this way they amassed much wealth, which they brought back to Númenor. \n\nBecause the Shadow lay heavy upon their hearts, the King's Men greatly feared Death and "sought to delay it by all means that they could." These attempts to escape their fate actually brought death upon them sooner, and the lifespans of their Kings waned. They filled the land of [numenor|E] with great tombs to preserve the memory of their dead, and their lives became ever more decadent: to ease their fears, they "drank and they feasted and they clad themselves in silver and gold." \n\nThe [akallabeth|E] was brought about by the decadence and hubris of the King's Men, and after the [downfallofnumenor|E], the King's Men suffered a perilous decline in their former colonial possessions.

At first, she was scared and weak, for it was a wicked place. But then she was discovered by the Great Spider, who saw great promise in her. For many nights, Sanbaiz secretly taught her to weave shadows and to summon mirages, to hide in the dark, and to spin webs of sand. The girl was scared and weak no longer, for she had learned to be cunning and clever.\n\nAfter her spouse was 'poisoned by liquid moonlight,' she returned to the dunes, where she taught the first Sanbaizani many secrets. Today, many coven-tribes in service to the Great Spider claim descent from her.\n\nDue to the nature of the story, passed down through oral tradition, many contradictory variations and interpretations of the tale exist. Some claim that the girl never left the Dune Sea and that her journey to the Land of Shadows was metaphorical for her death. Her body was then directly possessed by Sanbaiz.\nSome claim that the Spider-Cult of Sanbaiz simply originated as an offshoot of the wider Scorpion-Cult of Shâsmekh.\n\nSome even claim that the Cult of the Great Spider was the original faith of the Arani tribes, but beliefs slowly shifted over time as giant scorpions were much more prevalent in the Mirror of Fire."

Yet Doom was upon him, and his fate was for greater things. \n\nIn his thirtieth year, the goddess Ladnôca appeared before him in a dream, telling him of her husband Vâtra's plan to wrought for himself a new form with which to dominate the world again. Heeding the words of the goddess, Iunást gathered a band of companions and left for the mystical mountains of the east, where Vâtra was gathering his strength. Many trials did he and his companions endure until there were but two that at last came to Vâtra's darkened city beneath the black mountains. There at last they discovered Vâtra's vessel, blazing with the light of his fell heart, and Iunást strode forward to strike it. Yet with every step his body was consumed by the black flames, for Vâtra's spirit burned hot with hatred for [conceptmankind|E], and, indeed, for all things that dared to resist him. Yet at the last he struck it with his sword, silver with the light of the moon, and in Iunást's final moments, Vâtra could only roar in fury, for his great plot was halted. \n\nHis sole companion returned home to tell the tale of his friend's sacrifice and valor. But when he was speaking before the great assembly, in the east a new star arose, true and bright, outshining in that hour the Sun - Vâtra - himself. So it came to be believed that Ladnôca, in her mercy, had taken the spirit of Iunást, her champion, and raised him as her own son. Thus ascended, she placed him to keep forever a watch upon the heavens, who lingered when the moon vanishes or precedes the sun. He now remains perched, prepared to strike Vâtra should he ever again attempt to strike the world once more."

These queens are thought to be incarnations of Namur’s divine essence, guiding and protecting the land. The Tamska system, established by the first Tamska, Veryana, is rooted in the belief that the queens act as living embodiments of Namur’s will.\n\nIn addition to his role as a judge and protector, Namur is tied to the pursuit of spiritual enlightenment.

Trouble started when Valake IV's daughter, the Tamskangi, was murdered by her sister, who ascended to the throne as Valake V. When her treachery was discovered, she became the first Tamska in history to officially abdicate, and her sister, recognizing the choice of the council of elders, became Valake VI.\n\nWhen the council proclaimed they had found the new Tamskangi, a lowborn girl named Ânjiru, her new relatives welcomed her with envy and cold hatred.\n\nUpon her mother's deathbed, the eldest daughter of Valake V attempted to assassinate Ânjiru in order to secure the throne for herself. Ânjiru had to flee the capital, and when her rival proclaimed herself Valake VII, war broke loose between the heartlands, loyal to Valake, and the tribes of Mag and Tûmag, loyal to Ânjiru, who was backed by the Council of Elders. The conflict quickly devolved into a series of minor skirmishes, as Valake found herself unable to advance into the tribal lands loyal to Ânjiru, and Ânjiru employed hit-and-run tactics against her enemy but found herself unable to achieve any major victories.\n\nThe conflict eventually ended in [ageTA|E] 1375, when Tamska Valake VII finally died, having lost the support of most of the realm.

 game_concept_mothername:0 "Mother-name"
 game_concept_mothername_desc:0 "Amilessë, [quenya|E] for "mother-name", was the name given to an elf at, or some years after, birth by his or her mother, and it was one of the Elf's true names. It is one of the anessi, or given names, of [highelves|E], along with the father-name and epessë ("after-name" or honorific). The mother-name is a public name for an Elf and is quite significant because Elven mothers had insight into the characters and abilities of their children, and many also had the gift of prophetic foresight. \n\nThe most common type of mother-name is the amilessë tercenyë ("mother-name of insight"), given to the child as his or her personality began to develop, some years after birth. The amilessë apacenyë ("mother-name of foresight") was a rarer occurrence, given to the child from a vision of his or her special fate that the mother received in the hour of birth."

It is one of the anessi, or given names, of [highelves|E], along with the amilessë ("mother-name") and epessë ("after-name" or honorific). The father-name was a public name, announced in a ceremony called Essecarmë ("name-making"). It was often the primary name of an Elf until he or she chose to adopt an epessë given to them.\n\nAn example is Finrod Felagund, whose father-name was Findaráto ("Golden-Haired Champion") and epessë was Felagund ("Hewer of Caves").

Possessing brilliant emerald leaves and dark bark, even once cut, a bough from this tree would long hold its color and vitality, with some boughs known to last for years. Because of this, they became a key part of the tradition of the mariners of [numenor|E], whose female relatives or spouses would place a bough of Oiolairë upon their ships as a symbol of endurance and good fortune, as well as the friendship and protection of [ossecharacter|E] and [uinencharacter|E]. These were known as the 'Green Bough of Return.'"
