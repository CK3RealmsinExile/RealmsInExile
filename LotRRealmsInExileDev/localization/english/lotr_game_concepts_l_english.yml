 game_concept_bloodofnumenor_desc:0 "The Blood of Númenor is the blood of those descended from the Númenóreans, the inhabitants of the isle of [numenor|E]. The [valargods|E], on account of the valor of the Fathers of Men in the [firstage|E] and War of Wrath, gave to them a lifespan thrice that of lesser men and a land in which they lived in peace and prosperity. But in time the bliss of [numenor|E] waned, for the fear of death came among them, and forsaking their wisdom and friendship with the Eldar, hubris and lust for eternal life brought their doom.\n\nIn-game, the Blood of Númenor grants significant bonuses to longevity and stats. Unlike [congenital|E] traits, these bloodline traits cannot be 'upgraded' to a higher level and always face the risk of being lost. A child's chances of inheriting the greater bloodline trait from their parents is influenced by the moral character of the parents, with a more virtuous parentage resulting in greater chances of retaining the stronger Blood of Númenor trait.

For the first 400 years of the age the Long Peace endured, when the [noldorelves|E] kept [morgothcharacter|E] besieged within [angband|E] with a fence of swords. \n\nThe Siege was broken in the Battle of Sudden Flame, and one by one the realms of the [noldorelves|E] failed. \n\nIn the end only the combined forces of the [uttermostwest|E] and the Free Peoples of [beleriand|E] could cast down the Black Foe, resulting in the War of Wrath. \n\nIn the aftermath, the continent of [beleriand|E] was sunken and [morgothcharacter|E] was cast into the [thevoid|E] through the Gates of Night.

 game_concept_secondage_desc:0 "The Second Age (S.A.) began in the aftermath the War of Wrath. Many of the [elfexiles|E] chose to return to [aman|E], whereas those that opted to remain gathered under Ereinion Gil-galad or established kingdoms of their own. The Edain established the Kingdom of [numenor|E] in this age and reached the height of their power and bliss. \n\nIt was in the early 1500s of this age that [annatarcharacter|E] came to the doors of [eregion|E], posing as an emissary of the [valargods|E], winning the friendship of [celebrimbor|E]. Truly, this was [sauroncharacter|E], who aimed to shackle the Elves by guile. Thus, were the Great Rings brought into being, and in turn did Sauron craft the [oneringshort|E], the [rulingring|E]. War then came between Sauron and the Elves, ending with Sauron's defeat after a great host came from [numenor|E]. \n\nLater in the age, the [numenoreans|E], growing proud and envious of the Eldar, spoke against the [banofthevalar|E], and began to build an empire without peer. In time, [sauroncharacter|E] was taken captive in [numenor|E], and from within at last corrupted them into open revolt, culminating in the [akallabeth|E]. \n\nThe survivors of [faithful|El] of [numenor|E], the Eldar, and the Dwarves joined together in the [warlastalliance|E], and together overthrew [sauroncharacter|E], though the [rulingring|E] was not destroyed.

 game_concept_ageTA:0 "T.A."
 game_concept_thirdage_desc:0 "The Third Age (T.A.) began with the defeat of [sauroncharacter|E] in the [warlastalliance|E]. This age was dominated by the rise and declines of the Kingdoms-in-Exile, [gondor|E] and [arnor|E]. \n\n[arnor|E] split into three kingdoms, and was eventually destroyed by the Kingdom of Angmar. [gondor|E] grew in might and power and for a time was as [numenor|E] of old, but it now has long declined, though still strong. \n\nThe Elves became ever more concerned with conserving what lands they already held, and generally ceased attempting to expand. The Dwarves continued to prosper in their mountain halls until the fall of [khazaddum|E], when Durin's Bane awoke and slayed Durin VI, leading to the eventual foundation of the [ereborrealm|E]. \n\nIn the dwindling days of the Third Age, [sauroncharacter|E] prepared again to strike the Free Peoples, and hope rested on the edge of the knife. At the last, the valour of the smallest of beings, the [hobbits|E], unmade [sauroncharacter|E] and all his works. The ring-bearer and the holders of the [threeringsofelvesshort|E] at last sailed into the [uttermostwest|E], and thus ended the Third Age of Arda."

 game_concept_age_desc:0 "Ages are large spans of Time in which the Wise and the loremasters divided the history of Arda.

 game_concept_elderdays:0 "Elder Days"
 game_concept_elderdays_desc:0 "The Elder Days, during the [secondageshort|E] and [thirdage|E], properly referred to the times before the end of the [firstage|E]. In that context, the Middle Days were the Second and Third Ages, whereas the Younger Days were the foreseen Dominion of Men. \n\nHowever, in the Fourth Age the term began to be applied to all previous Ages, as the time before the Dominion of Men and the dwindling of the Elves and other races. Aragorn for instance, referred to himself as the last King of the Elder Days, according to the latter sense."

Then at last, he deemed it time to throw off the yoke of Armenelos, and raised himself in revolt, assaulting the great haven of [umbar|E]. For a moment he appeared to prevail, as did the [stormking|E] in the south - but the armies of [westernesse|E] descended like a whirlwind, and routed both utterly.\n\nHis realm shattered and nursing his wounds, Adûnabêth fled into the desert wastes, where not even the [numenoreans|E] would dare to pursue. In the south of that burning desert he raised the dread realm of Abrakhân. He cast aside his Adûnaic name, and rechristened himself as Harwenal Vedaraba, 'The Shining Son of Harad'. Now known as the Golden King, Adûnabêth dominated the Dune Sea and East Harad for the next 900 years, ordering the Haradrim in opposition of the [faithfulshort|E] and the Elves.

Finally, the Harfoots were the most numerous and instituted the living in burrows. In later days the Harfoot traits became the "norm".\n\nThe Hobbits are first known to have dwelled in the Vales of [anduin|E].

The time at which a young hobbit "comes of age" is 33. \n\nHobbits are by nature of gentle disposition, though often provincial in outlook; they are fond of an unadventurous bucolic life of farming, eating, smoking pipe-weed, socializing and talking about genealogies. Yet do not underestimate them, for they are hardy in times of trial, and show a fierce resolve when roused.\n\n#TOLKIENQUOTE "I am in fact a Hobbit (in all but size).
