 VIETrepublic.0001.t:0 "Clothes Shopping"
 VIETrepublic.0001.desc:0 "There are several upcoming balls I and my family will be attending, and I think it is high time we got some new dress clothes to impress the other patrician families who will be attending these events. Currently, there are many clothing fads out there, so as the head of the household it will be up to me to decide which style best suits us."
 VIETrepublic.0001.a:0 "Opulent and luxurious styles - everyone will know of our wealth!"
 VIETrepublic.0001.b:0 "Simple clothes will do, to convince others we are humble yet still stylish."
 VIETrepublic.0001.c:0 "Something exotic, as if it's from a faraway land, to wow all!"
 VIETrepublic.0001.d:0 "On second thought, this is a vain waste of money."
 VIETrepublic.0002.t:0 "Nautical Charts"
 VIETrepublic.0002.desc:0 "Many republics such as ours have developed a tradition of cartography, given such a science is essential in aiding our merchants travel far and wide. Today, I am visiting a cartographer and observing various maps and nautical charts he has made. One strikes my fancy, and he says he can sell it to me if I'm interested."
 VIETrepublic.0002.a:0 "It would be helpful! You have a deal."
 VIETrepublic.0002.b:0 "Surely we can negotiate a better price."
 VIETrepublic.0002.c:0 "It's interesting but I don't need it."
 VIETrepublic.0003.t:0 "Warehouse Disaster"
 VIETrepublic.0003.desc:0 "Bad news! One of the warehouses belonging to my family caught on fire. While we managed to put it out, a large chunk of the warehouse got damaged, and worse, we lost some of the trade goods we had stored there."
 VIETrepublic.0003.a:0 "This is very bad, very bad indeed."
 VIETrepublic.0004.t:0 "An Old Family, No More"
 VIETrepublic.0004.desc:0 "Today I received news that the final surviving member of an old patrician family in our republic just passed away. As they had no heirs, this marks the end of their dynasty. It is a strange thing to think about, honestly, and I have been ruminating on it all day. As a child, I had heard tales of this family's influence back in their heyday, their many caravans and ships bringing them much wealth from trade. Now there is nothing left to their name, save for a few mentions in the republic's records and monuments. It makes me wonder how my family will fare in the generations to come."
 VIETrepublic.0004.a:0 "Sadly, one day our name will fade away as well, alas!"
 VIETrepublic.0004.b:0 "Our mighty family and its legacy shall ensure forever."
 VIETrepublic.0004.c:0 "Let’s focus on the present and not worry for the future."
 VIETrepublic.0005.t:0 "Caravan Disrupted"
 VIETrepublic.0005.desc:0 "Troubling reports have come to my attention today. Several traveling merchants in my family's employ have fallen gravely ill while out on a trade expedition on our behalf. It appears some disease spread like wildfire through their caravan. Alas, all we know of their situation is from the letter they provided, but this will surely have negative consequences on our short-term profits. Hopefully, they will be able to find capable physicians to treat them."
 VIETrepublic.0005.a:0 "What terrible news!"
 VIETrepublic.0006.t:0 "An Unfortunate Employee"
 VIETrepublic.0006.desc:0 "I have learned that one of the men in my employ has been secretly stealing my family's trade goods and selling them on the black market. I am deeply saddened to hear this, as this man was someone I trusted deeply and who I treated as a friend. He claims he had no choice as his family is deep in debt, and he needed extra money, but can I really trust him? He could have just gone to me for help. On the other hand, perhaps this was something he stubbornly wanted to solve on his own, even if through illicit means."
 VIETrepublic.0006.a:0 "Take him to court. No matter what, he still stole from us."
 VIETrepublic.0006.b:0 "I'll forgive him if he apologizes and promises not to do it again."
 VIETrepublic.0006.c:0 "Fire the man. That should be punishment enough."
 VIETrepublic.0006.d:0 "Black market, you say? What if we worked together to smuggle?"
 VIETrepublic.0007.t:0 "Nouveau Riche"
 VIETrepublic.0007.desc:0 "[RP_snob.GetTitledFirstName] introduced me to a wealthy merchant today. Though I have no business with this man at the moment, I find him pleasant, if a little too eager to show off his fine clothes and jewelry.\n\nShortly after he leaves, [RP_snob.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] previous smile changes into a scowl: "I can't believe I have to work with him. He may be an important business partner, but personally? I detest him. He's nouveau riche, you see, and not from the old patrician families like us. He was just a peddler who happened to get lucky a couple years ago, and is now showing off to everyone, despite his lack of class.""
 VIETrepublic.0007.a:0 "New or old money, if he helps you make money, what’s the issue?"
 VIETrepublic.0007.b:0 "These nouveau riche think they're our equals! He must be a pain."
 VIETrepublic.0007.c:0 "We all started somewhere. He must've worked hard to accrue his wealth."
 VIETrepublic.0008.t:0 "Just Business?"
 VIETrepublic.0008.desc:0 "One of the trade ships belonging to my family recently returned, having made greater profit than expected. At first, we were all happy with what happened - more money is good, right?\n\nHowever, I have just now learned the extra money was not honorably acquired. The ship’s captain engaged in piracy during the course of his journey. He stole not only from a other merchant vessels, but also raided a few coastal villages he passed by. None of the people he stole from were under our republic of its allies' jurisdictions, so he will likely not get in trouble for it, not to mention it isn’t uncommon for armed merchants to occasionally engage in banditry to bolster our income. Still, he did not ask my permission to do this, and it does not sit well with me."
 VIETrepublic.0008.a:0 "Even if dishonorable, he made us more money. Business is business."
 VIETrepublic.0008.b:0 "Terrible! I’ll donate the stolen goods to a [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HouseOfWorship] to repent!"
 VIETrepublic.0009.t:0 "Another Meeting"
 VIETrepublic.0009.desc:0 "I am sitting at a meeting with a number of representatives from other patrician families, powerful guilds, and so on. We are discussing potential changes to the republic’s regulations concerning commerce within its borders. Alas, the current discussion is not particularly relevant to the interests of the [ROOT.Char.GetDynastyName], and I am starting to doze off."
 VIETrepublic.0009.a:0 "A little nap will do me good while the buffoons argue."
 VIETrepublic.0009.b:0 "I should pay attention, just in case it might help me later."
 VIETrepublic.0010.t:0 "Tips and Tricks"
 VIETrepublic.0010.desc:0 "I am attending a small banquet with several business acquaintances, and we are discussing the commercial fortunes of our respective families. One man is explaining to us some of the things he has learned while engaging in trade expeditions abroad.\n\n“Since you all seem like good people,” he smiles, “I’ll let you in on a secret trick of mine. We all hate the regulations foreign cities place on our traders, but if you show respect to their officials, and slip them a little money, they’ll be friendly and tax your goods and products at a lower value than they’re supposed to..”\n\nHe then goes on to explain the different methods he uses to bribe and butter up foreign officials. While bribery is not a new idea, this man has interesting advice about it, especially in foreign lands."
 VIETrepublic.0010.a:0 "It is all very informative!"
 VIETrepublic.0011.t:0 "Trade Rumors"
 VIETrepublic.0011.desc:0 "Today I met a traveling merchant who has recently returned from a lengthy trip overseas. While discussing the current state of the markets of foreign lands, he tells me some rumors he heard concerning the prices of various commodities and how they will fare in the future - which ones would be good or bad to invest in, for example. On one hand, the rumors he speak of seem reasonable and make sense, and he did just come back from abroad; on the other hand, can I really take his word for it?"
 VIETrepublic.0011.a:0 "He doesn’t seem dishonest, but I don’t know how reliable his sources are."
 VIETrepublic.0011.b:0 "He has fresh, firsthand information from foreign lands - I can trust him."
 VIETrepublic.0011.result:0 "I will follow this man's advice and make some investments based on these trade rumors, potentially earning me some [income|E] - hopefully, these rumors prove reliable!"
 VIETrepublic.0011.toast.good:0 "The trade rumors turn out to be reliable"
 VIETrepublic.0011.toast.bad:0 "The trade rumors turn out to be unreliable"
 VIETrepublic.0012.t:0 "Pirates Demand Ransom"
 VIETrepublic.0012.desc:0 "What misfortune! I’ve received news that one of the ships sailing under the banner of the [ROOT.Char.GetDynastyName] was attacked by ruthless pirates. The boat was intentionally sunk after the pirates looted all the goods on board and enslaved my crew. I only learned of this because a few of the crew members managed to escape and find their way back home. They beg me to save their fellow crewmates and pay the pirates a ransom."
 VIETrepublic.0012.a:0 "This is most unfortunate, but I cannot do anything."
 VIETrepublic.0012.b:0 "Blasted pirates! I’ll pay the ransom to save our friends!"
 VIETrepublic.0012.c:0 "I can negotiate with these pirates to lessen the ransom."
 VIETrepublic.0013.t:0 "A Storm"
 VIETrepublic.0013.desc:0 "Terrible news! A cargo ship sailing under the banner of the [ROOT.Char.GetDynastyName] got caught up in a storm recently. The boat sunk, and there were few survivors. Besides the terrible loss of life, this will surely cost us a great deal financially."
 VIETrepublic.0013.a:0 "This is so frustrating!"
 VIETrepublic.0014.t:0 "Will the Spice Flow?"
 VIETrepublic.0014.desc:0 "Not too long ago I paid a small and modest amount of money to invest in a few traders who sought to take advantage of the spice trade. It turns out that this investment, which even I considered a touch risky, has paid off!"
 VIETrepublic.0014.a:0 "Wonderful!"
 VIETrepublic.0015.t:0 "Lost Caravan"
 VIETrepublic.0015.desc:0 "One of the trade caravans owned by the [ROOT.Char.GetDynastyName] was supposed to arrive in town a month ago, but it never did. We had assumed was attacked by bandits or that some other calamity had befallen the caravan.\n\nHowever, as it turns out, the entire caravan arrived today. Some of the carts are damaged, and a few of the horses dead or wounded, but everything else is fine. According to the caravan master, they encountered some bad weather and a number of the carts broke down. This delayed their trip by a couple weeks.\n\nWhile it is fortunate that the caravan has returned safely, the prices for the goods it is carrying has declined somewhat in the last few weeks. Thus, I will have to sell these products at a loss."
 VIETrepublic.0015.a:0 "Alas! Every merchant worries about something like this happening."
 VIETrepublic.0016.t:0 "Pirate Wreck"
 VIETrepublic.0016.desc:0 "While out at sea, a [ROOT.Char.GetDynastyName] trade ship encountered what appeared to be the remnants of a pirate vessel. There were few survivors found in the wreck, and based on their testimony, it seems like their ship got caught in a storm soon after they raided a number of seaside towns in some foreign lands.\n\nAnyways, my ship’s captain tells me that the wreck did have a number of salvageable goods, which he took with him. He suggests I sell these off to make some extra profit - one man’s misfortune is another’s fortune, it seems!"
 VIETrepublic.0016.a:0 "Excellent idea!"
 VIETrepublic.0017.t:0 "Uncharted Island"
 VIETrepublic.0017.desc:0 "One of my trade ships recently got lost in a storm, but thankfully the ship, its cargo, and most of the crew survived intact. However, as a result of this, the ship got lost, and the crew encountered a strange island that no one from our republic had ever seen or heard of. The crew mapped out the island, which was very small (perhaps explaining why no one knows of it), before they managed to find their way back home. They’ve provided me the map, and I can sell some copies to the local cartographers for some good money."
 VIETrepublic.0017.a:0 "Good job, men!"
 VIETrepublic.0018.t:0 "Memories of a Trip"
 VIETrepublic.0018.desc:0 "I am visiting an elderly patrician in the city, who I am somewhat acquainted with. In his youth, this man was quite the adventurer, partaking in a number of daring trade expeditions for profit and glory in faraway lands. Now, he has long since retired.\n\nHe still keeps a number of large parchment maps around his residence, as mementos of his younger days. While we relax and chat, I take note of one of them.\n\n“Ah, now that was quite a trip I made,” he says when he sees me looking at it. “The map depicts the land of…. Ah, am I boring you? No? Good! Let me tell you about what happened when I came to that enchanting realm so many years ago….”"
 VIETrepublic.0018.a:0 "I learned quite a lot from what he told me today."
 VIETrepublic.0019.t:0 "The Fountain"
 VIETrepublic.0019.desc:0 "I have the opportunity to donate some funds for the construction of a modest fountain down the street from where I live. The name of our dynasty, the great [ROOT.Char.GetDynastyName], would be carved into the fountain. Given the fountains' relative rarity, and their importance as symbols of spiritual power for some, it would be a great way to show my influence in the republic (in contrast to the other patrician families)."
 VIETrepublic.0019.a:0 "Let’s build this fountain, then!"
 VIETrepublic.0019.b:0 "Such a vain project is beneath me."
 VIETrepublic.0020.t:0 "Dance the Night Away"
 VIETrepublic.0020.desc:0 "At a ball hosted by one of the patrician families of the republic, it has come to my attention that many of the people there are dancing a… very strange dance, one I have not seen before. I do not recognize the way the partiers’ move their arms and legs to the music the lute players are playing.\n\n[RP_breakdancer.GetTitledFirstName], who is also there, notices my puzzlement, and laughs, “This dance is the latest fad in town! Everyone is learning it! I’m surprised you've never seen it before.”\n\n“I don't think I can dance this...” I ask.\n\n“Nonsense! It’s not a difficult dance to do, once you learn the basics,” [RP_breakdancer.GetSheHe] tells me. “Come, let me show you how it’s done - it’ll be fun!”"
 VIETrepublic.0020.a:0 "I’ll just relax here and watch you. Enjoy yourself!"
 VIETrepublic.0020.b:0 "I’d be honored! Now, how should I move my feet?"
 VIETrepublic.0021.t:0 "Baklava!"
 VIETrepublic.0021.desc:0 "I am attending a ball hosted by one of the patrician families in the republic. The host is serving us all manner of baklava, a delicacy famous throughout the Mediterranean and Middle East for its delicious syrupy sugary sweetness. Everyone loves it, and I am no different!"
 VIETrepublic.0021.a:0 "Please, let me have more baklava!"
 VIETrepublic.0022.t:0 "Save the Cargo"
 VIETrepublic.0022.desc:0 "One of my family’s ships has just grounded itself a few miles away from the city. There is enough time to save some of the cargo, but I’m afraid that we won’t be able to save everything. Either way, this will cost our family business some profits this month."
 VIETrepublic.0022.a:0 "We have to move fast - let’s recover what we can!"
 VIETrepublic.0022.b:0 "Men, make sure to recover these goods in particular."
 VIETrepublic.0023.t:0 "A Moral Dilemma"
 VIETrepublic.0023.desc:0 "Tonight I’ll be concluding a business deal with one of my new contacts, but I’m feeling uneasy as my religious convictions are getting in the way. While I won’t be doing anything illegal, if I go through with this deal, there’s a good chance I will have to do something that goes against my [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] beliefs. If I don’t, I’ll lose the money I put into this deal already."
 VIETrepublic.0023.a:0 "The deal is good as done. [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] will forgive me."
 VIETrepublic.0023.b:0 "Let’s cancel the deal. I feel too guilty about this."
 VIETrepublic.0024.t:0 "Selling at a Loss"
 VIETrepublic.0024.desc:0 "I’ve misjudged the potential profits of the new shipment of commodities I wish to sell that just arrived today. Unfortunately, the prices have dropped noticeably. Now I’ll lose quite an amount of money when I sell the goods to my buyers. I cannot leave these goods lying around for too long, at any rate, so I have little choice on this matter and must sell them now."
 VIETrepublic.0024.a:0 "We’ll just sell the goods for whatever price we can."
 VIETrepublic.0024.b:0 "Convince my buyers to buy the goods at higher prices."
 VIETrepublic.0025.t:0 "Higher Demand, Higher Prices"
 VIETrepublic.0025.desc:0 "I’ve misjudged the potential profits of the new shipment of commodities I wish to sell that just arrived today… but in a most fortunate way. Out of nowhere, it seems, demand has risen significantly for these specific products, which means I can sell them at an even higher price to my customers if I wanted to!"
 VIETrepublic.0025.a:0 "I want good relations with my customers. Sell at the usual price."
 VIETrepublic.0025.b:0 "Excellent news! Let’s make some profits off of these people."
 VIETrepublic.0026.t:0 "A Poor Decision"
 VIETrepublic.0026.desc:0 "A few months ago, [RP_loser.GetTitledFirstName] made a very poor decision in supporting a business venture [RP_loser.GetSheHe] knew was a risky investment - so risky, that no one else in the republic would have put their money in it. To no one’s surprise, [RP_loser.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] lost a lot of money. As a result, [RP_loser.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] is understandably very distraught.\n\n“I can’t believe I was that much of an idiot!” [RP_loser.GetSheHe] says. “Now I’ll be the laughingstock of the whole republic!”"
 VIETrepublic.0026.a:0 "You made a poor decision, now live with it."
 VIETrepublic.0026.b:0 "Let me give some advice. Next time, you should…"
 VIETrepublic.0027.t:0 "An Excellent Decision"
 VIETrepublic.0027.desc:0 "A few months ago, [RP_winner.GetTitledFirstName] decided to throw [RP_winner.GetHerHis] support behind a somewhat risky business venture. Some in the republic said it would not end well, others felt it was a risk worth taking. Anyhow, in the end, [RP_winner.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] ended up making quite a bit of coin from that investment."
 VIETrepublic.0027.a:0 "Good for [RP_winner.GetHerHim]! That excellent decision paid off."
 VIETrepublic.0028.t:0 "The Workers Unite"
 VIETrepublic.0028.desc:0 "Some of the people working for the [ROOT.Char.GetDynastyName] family business have recently complained about what they feel are low and unjust wages. Many of them have banded together to demand that I raise their wages to what they feel is a reasonable amount. While truthfully doing so would not cut into my profits significantly, the idea doesn't sits well with me - what if they feel bolstered to demand more? However, I must be careful. One wrong move, and everyone in the republic will think the [ROOT.Char.GetDynastyName] are a family of cruel and selfish robber barons."
 VIETrepublic.0028.a:0 "If they’re unhappy, I’ll just hire new workers to replace them."
 VIETrepublic.0028.b:0 "Very well. I will agree to their demands and raise their wages."
 VIETrepublic.0028.c:0 "I care about my workers - in fact, I will exceed their demands!"
 VIETrepublic.0028.d:0 "Why don’t we negotiate some kind of acceptable compromise?"
 VIETrepublic.0029.t:0 "By the Docks"
 VIETrepublic.0029.desc:0 "A trade ship belonging to the [ROOT.Char.GetDynastyName] arrived in port today, with new goods that we will sell soon. I am inspecting the cargo and discussing with my workers about how things are going, as well as any rumors they have recently heard about faraway lands on their travels - after all, any rumor could be valuable information when trying to gauge the state of the markets elsewhere."
 VIETrepublic.0029.a:0 "It was a productive day." 
 VIETrepublic.0030.t:0 "Garden Statue"
 VIETrepublic.0030.desc:0 "I am hosting a lesser merchant who I recently did a trade deal with. We are walking around my garden, discussing this and that, when one item strikes his fancy. It is a stone sculpture of a person, crafted in a foreign art style, that I bought many years ago. He is clearly mesmerized by the skill of the craftsmanship, and how it depicts the human form beautifully.\n\n“Why do you leave this statue tucked away here in the garden?” he asks. “You should display it in a more central location. That way, everyone will see you're someone with good taste in art. Better yet, would you be interested in selling the statue to me?”"
 VIETrepublic.0030.a:0 "I think the statue looks better in this quiet, peaceful garden."
 VIETrepublic.0030.b:0 "I never thought of that! I’ll move it to the front of my residence."
 VIETrepublic.0030.c:0 "You can have this statue, but only if you offer me a fair price."
 VIETrepublic.0031.t:0 "Trade Regulations"
 VIETrepublic.0031.desc:0 "Today, I had to stop by the city hall to conduct some business. While there, I met one of the clerks who works there and is well-acquainted with the republic’s laws. We had a pretty fruitful discussion about the republic’s trade regulations, particularly those which have changed recently, before we parted ways."
 VIETrepublic.0031.a:0 "I’ll have to remember what I was told - it could come in handy."
 VIETrepublic.0032.t:0 "No Deal"
 VIETrepublic.0032.desc:0 "I met with a prospective business partner today. I had hoped that he would present some new commerce opportunities for me, but the man is, to say the least, an absolute disaster. His clothing looked disheveled and nothing like the current fashions, and his manner of speech was rambling and unimpressive.\n\nI can stand a boring business partner, or even a slightly dull one who has other virtues such as excellent connections, but someone like this who is clearly incompetent is not someone who I want to work with. He seemed upset that I did not appear interested in working with him, but I diplomatically reassured him that it was nothing personal."
 VIETrepublic.0032.a:0 "Still, dealing with these kinds of morons gives me a headache!"
 VIETrepublic.0033.t:0 "Foiled Robbery Attempt"
 VIETrepublic.0033.desc:0 "Last night, a number of men attempted to sneak into my residence and make off with some of my valuables. They targeted my house because they had heard of the immense wealth owned by the [ROOT.Char.GetDynastyName], thanks to our thriving family business. At any rate, these thieves would have escaped had it not been for the diligence of my guards.\n\nThe criminals will be punished in the republic’s courts, but this does raise a number of questions about security at my residence. Unless I take action, this challenge to our family dignity could lower my standing among the other patrician families, who would think of us as incompetent and weak."
 VIETrepublic.0033.a:0 "We did nothing wrong. My guards even foiled the thieves!"
 VIETrepublic.0033.b:0 "I’ll invest in more guards and better walls."
 VIETrepublic.0034.t:0 "Business Advice"
 VIETrepublic.0034.desc:0 "At a ball I am attending, I happen to meet a young patrician from a minor family. His eyes are alight with admiration as he tells me, "I consider myself a great admirer of yours. The [ROOT.Char.GetDynastyName] are, without a doubt, one of the great and influential wealthy merchant families of our republic! I have heard much about you, and your acumen when it comes to business. I've just started out, inheriting some money from my uncle, and helping my family continue to build on our existing assets. Is there any advice you can give me when it comes to business?""
 VIETrepublic.0034.a:0 "Sorry, I'm busy and need to talk to someone else. Farewell."
 VIETrepublic.0034.b:0 "Hard work and restraint are a merchant’s greatest virtues."
 VIETrepublic.0034.c:0 "It's all about who you know and knowing your customers well."
 VIETrepublic.0035.t:0 "Math Calculations"
 VIETrepublic.0035.desc:0 "I am working at my desk today, looking over various aspects of my business, when I notice some numerical errors on some older financial documents. It seems I miscalculated some transactions I did recently and instead of making a profit I actually lost money! Thankfully it wasn't a huge amount, but that doesn't mean I am happy about it either."
 VIETrepublic.0035.a:0 "I'll need to make it a habit to triple check my math more often."
 VIETrepublic.0036.t:0 "Abacus Assistance"
 VIETrepublic.0036.desc:0 "I and [RP_calculator.GetTitledFirstName] have recently joined forces to negotiate a business deal together. We are currently looking over the financial documents and calculating various things related to the deal.\n\n"Can you check my calculations?" [RP_calculator.GetSheHe] asks, coming over to where I am sitting, an abacus in  [RP_calculator.GetHerHis] hand. "I feel like I'm missing something here, but the numbers just don't add up."\n\nI take the abacus and perform the calculation myself, with little difficulty, and explain how I did it. Afterwards, [RP_calculator.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] smacks [RP_calculator.GetHerselfHimself] on the head when [RP_calculator.GetSheHe] realizes the problem.\n\n"Ah!" [RP_calculator.GetSheHe] says, taking the abacus back, "Seems like I made an elementary error and didn't double check the numbers there. No wonder I kept getting it wrong with the abacus! Thanks for the help!""
