With the coming of Elendil of the Dúnedain, its last rulers, Merethorn & Eliniel ceded the land and their Dúnedain subjects to him.\n\nThose times have long passed however, and the waning of the Dúnedain caused them to abandon ancient Sîrgala long ago, even before the Fall of [arnor|E].

For countless generations it has been a thorn in [gondor|E]'s side, and now, a knife aimed at its coastal underbelly. Its raids tie up much of the men and materials of Gondor, depriving them from the war against Sauron. This cannot stand any longer.

But there are threats which will one day come to its shores if they are not pre-empted. Many in Lindon know this, but lack the leadership to take the step. Well, I am. My name, and that of my family, is stained with innocent blood, which might never be cleansed. But let it not be said we did not try.

Filled with renowned and grizzled captains of Belfalas, the Order held itself to the highest of standards, embodying true the height of Númenórean honour and virtue...\n\nUnfortunately, however, Men are easily corrupted, and in the centuries following its original foundation the Order slowly began to decay. Bloodlines and positions at court, not valour or individual virtue, now dictate the ranks of its members, muddling the grandeur of the Order that had for so many centuries stood as a beacon for all of Gondor. If the Sons of the Silver Swan are to reclaim their legacy as the Kingdom's finest knights, the ill-festering state of the Order must be mended."

The name has also become that of the elite guard units which protect the tower, the Oathkeepers of Tirith-Aear, the most elite of the Sea-ward troops. Required to swear oaths of virtue and valour, these wardens should be of unimpeachable character. But of all the classes of the old Order, this one rotted most, with the position being given on account of blood, not valour. It will require great effort to rebuild it to its former glory. \n\nWe shall begin by dismissing those of the order known to be corrupt, and then begin searching for those worthy of this great honour."

Of unmatched moral fibre and great skill in arms, only a select few are ever counted amongst this most hallowed order. To be offered such a chance is accounted an honour beyond price in the lands of Dol Amroth, and few refuse it, for it is both a great honour and a crushing duty. \n\nWith these handpicked warriors, paragons of valour and skill, the Prince has nothing to fear, for he is guarded by the most capable men in all of Dor-en-Ernil."

Since the [downfallofnumenor|E], these lands have bickered, fighting each other. Bellakar waxed while An-Balkûmagân raged, the [thanihazad|E] strove to maintain a frozen, eternal order.

 #### Sauron/Mordor Decisions ####
 #################################
 
 decision_construct_grond:0 "Construct Grond"
 decision_construct_tooltip:0 "Construction of the Grond Siege Unit will begin."
 decision_construct_desc:0 "Great engines crawled across the field; and in the midst was a huge ram, great as a forest-tree a hundred feet in length, swinging on mighty chains. Long had it been forging in the dark smithies of Mordor, and its hideous head, founded of black steel, was shaped in the likeness of a ravening wolf; on it spells of ruin lay. Grond they named it, in memory of the Hammer of the Underworld of old. Great beasts drew it, orcs surrounded it, and behind walked mountain-trolls to wield it."
 decision_construct_confirm:0 "The Hammer of the Underworld shall lay low all whom hinder its destructive power."
 decision_construct_tool_tip:0 "Construction of the Grond Siege Unit will begin"

 grond:0 "Grond"
 grond_flavor:0 "A battering ram of monstrous size, tapped with a wolf's head of black iron, Grond was the weapon with which Sauron would breach the walls of Minas Tirith. Named after the weapon of Morgoth, the Hammer of the Underworld, no siege weapon had been made of its size before, and none afterwards."

 decision_sauron_tribute_leofring_desc:0 "From the shadows of the forest fell things come forth, striking at us, and overwhelming us like a black tide. But we have discovered that sometimes they might be placated with fine horses and gold, and leave us in peace for a time…"

They are most fearsome weapons, commanders without peer, but they are tools for specific purposes, ill-suited for others.\n\nWith his realm arisen anew, perhaps it is time to recall the Golden King to my direct service once more..."

 decision_invade_gondor_tooltip:0 "Launch an invasion that, if successful, will destroy the Southern Kingdom once and for all"
 decision_invade_gondor_desc:0 "Gondor has stood defiant against your will, Great Lord, for far too long.

But there exist two entrances that allow invaders to bypass the unscalable mountain ranges: the passes of Cirith Gorgor and Cirith Ungol.\n\nIn order to ensure the safety of Mordor against any attack from [gondor|E] or her northern allies we must build or remake the fortifications at the Black Gate and at Minas Morgul."

 decision_reorganize_nurn_desc:0 "The Núrniags have styled themselves [king|E]s of Núrn for a time, but that will now change. There is only one true King of Mordor - and all of [middleearth|E], and He does not share his power.\n\nLet us remind the Núrniags of their place and assume direct control of the slave economy that feeds the armies of the Black Lands. With direct oversight, a much better production rate will be enforced in due time."

 decision_reject_sauron_tooltip:0 "Free of his yoke, you can now let your true opinion on the Dark Lord known."
 decision_reject_sauron_desc:0 "Why should I revere the Dark Lord? He abandoned Mordor and us orcs for thousands of years, fleeing like a craven coward!

While these periods of overlordship have never lasted long, they have marked high points of [khand|E]'s influence, prosperity, and stability. \n\nIf we can bring our Nurniag brethren under our banner, and control the trade routes through Chelkar, we can perhaps formalize the greater realm of [khand|E], not just in theory but in truth."

 decision_introduce_the_heir_desc:0 "In order to consolidate the continued rule of my dynasty, considering the customs of my people, it may be prudent to call together a meeting of my vassals in which to formally introduce my heir. During this event, my vassals will be given free reign to question and challenge my heir and test their capabilities. This will give my heir a chance to win allies and prove their worthiness, so that my vassals may choose to maintain fealty to them once I am no more.\n\nHowever, these events rarely are not without their trials and risks, as my vassals will surely aim to put my heir under intense scrutiny and pressure to test their mettle. In addition, they can only be tested once - repeatedly doing such will shatter any legitimacy these contests would provide."

Under our firm hand, our people have prospered and expanded, and now few live among our subjects who remember a day when our house did not rule supreme over them. \n\nWith this, we stand in an unprecedented position to permanently alter our people's very nature and path. Too long have we destroyed ourselves, our own greatest foes. When a mighty lord dies, all too quickly his vassals abandon his heir, fighting for the scraps. We shall writ a new law of fealty and of obligation - no more shall vassals freely abandon their liege's heirs, but oaths shall endure from father to son. With our dynasty's prestige and long-rule, while difficult, this is possible. What we have accomplished through personal valour shall now become formalized fact."

Yet, I could secure his loyalty now by promising him greater power under my rule and forging a bond through marriage to his family.\n\nLeofwyn, his daughter, is renowned for her beauty. Marrying her would not only win me Thorne’s support but also strengthen my claim to the throne. A Rohirrim bride would quiet doubts among the lords of the Mark, lending my rule the legitimacy of the old bloodlines I seek to reclaim."
