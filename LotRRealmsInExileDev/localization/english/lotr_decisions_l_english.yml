The southern forest has become a dark and twisted place, unfriendly and dangerous.\n\nBut if we can reclaim the southern forest, we can reclaim the mantle of the former kingdom of [greenwood|E]. Indeed, just as our realm may be reborn, so too might the forest itself, shedding its twisted and dark connotations - no longer the [greenwoodshort|E] of yore, nor the [mirkwood|E] of infamy, but [erynlasgalen|E], the Wood of Greenleaves."

Populated by the $sirrandrai$ [elves|E], it was ravaged during the [waroftheelvesandsauron|E], with only a few returning to those lands after its conclusion. Subsequent settlement by [dunedain|E] settlers meant that the country had only a small Elven population by the end of the [secondage|E]. With the coming of Elendil of the Dúnedain, its last rulers, Merethorn & Eliniel ceded the land and their Dúnedain subjects to him.\n\nThose times have long passed however, and the waning of the Dúnedain caused them to abandon ancient Sîrgala long ago, even before the Fall of [arnor|E].

 decision_claim_high_kingship_desc:0 "Since the fall of Gil-galad in the [lastalliance|E], there has been no High-King of the [noldorelves|E].

Greatest of these is [sauroncharacter|E], his mightiest lieutenant. Tormentor of Maedhros and Finrod, deciever of Celebrimbor, slayer of Gil-galad - his crimes against the [noldorelves|E] alone are legion, to speak nothing of his countless other crimes. His power has waxed in this age of dwindling, but he is not invincible, nor unassailable.

For countless generations it has been a thorn in [gondor|E]'s side, and now, a knife aimed at its coastal underbelly. Its raids tie up much of the men and materials of Gondor, depriving them from the war against Sauron. This cannot stand any longer. Let us rally what of the Men of Gondor will join us and neutralize this threat.\n\nUmbar is not the first port [maglor|E] has put to the torch, but Eru willing, let this be the last."

But there are threats which will one day come to its shores if they are not pre-empted. Many in Lindon know this, but lack the leadership to take the step. Well, I am. My name, and that of my family, is stained with innocent blood, which might never be cleansed. But let it not be said we did not try.

Bloodlines and positions at court, not valour or individual virtue, now dictate the ranks of its members, muddling the grandeur of the Order that had for so many centuries stood as a beacon for all of Gondor.
