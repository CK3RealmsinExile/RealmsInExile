 decision_integrate_andrast_desc:0 "Andrast has always been, at least in theory, a part of Gondor. But, outside of the citadel of Tharagrondost, the power of the Dúnedain in the region has always been tenuous, even at the height of Gondor's power.

 decision_dol_amroth_reforms_desc:0 "Long ago the Order of the Swan was created by the Princes of Dol Amroth to act as their personal advisors and fiercest champions in battle. Filled with renowned and grizzled captains of Belfalas, the Order held itself to the highest of standards, embodying true the height of Númenórean honour and virtue...\n\nUnfortunately, however, Men are easily corrupted, and in the centuries following its original foundation the Order slowly began to decay. Bloodlines and positions at court, not valour or individual virtue, now dictate the ranks of its members, muddling the grandeur of the Order that had for so many centuries stood as a beacon for all of Gondor. If the Sons of the Silver Swan are to reclaim their legacy as the Kingdom's finest knights, the ill-festering state of the Order must be mended."

 decision_dol_amroth_amrothian_troops_desc:0 "For years relegated to being the humblest of positions within the Order of the Swan, the Amrothian soldiery has in many ways been the group which have maintained the true spirit of the original Order the best. However, despite this, their ranks have been sadly depleted, the role viewed as lacking in honour and splendour and thus neglected. \n\nLet us work on restoring this backbone of our forces to their proper fighting strength."

 decision_dol_amroth_elvish_troops_desc:0 "Edhellond, once-home of the Elven domain of the same name, is one of the noblest and richest governates of Dor-en-Ernil. They strive to emulate Elven tactics in warfare, in contrast with the rest of Gondor, who maintain a firm martial tradition inherited from the days of Númenor. Their ranks amongst the Order have sat empty, oaths unsaid as the rot festered within the organization. We must make anew our oaths of old. \n\nIf they could be reintegrated into the armies of the Prince, they could serve as a powerful and innovative contingent." 
 decision_dol_amroth_elvish_troops_confirm:0 "Send our fastest rider." 
 
 decision_dol_amroth_seaward_troops:0 "Expand the Sea-ward Regiments"
 decision_dol_amroth_seaward_troops_tooltip:0 "Begin the training of a Sea-ward Regiment" 
 decision_dol_amroth_seaward_troops_desc:0 "Once the Dor-en-Ernil equal to the mighty marines of Pelargir, the Sea-ward regiments fought on the high seas and the coasts, besting corsairs and winning high honours. However, as Pelargir has risen in prominence as the heart of the Royal Navy, this guard division has dwindled to a skeleton force, maintaining a few coastal lookouts at most. \n\nIf we could expand them once more; they would once again serve us well as fearsome shock-troops."

 decision_dol_amroth_tirith_aear_troops_desc:0 "The Tirith-Aear, or 'Sea-ward Tower' in Sindarin, is the great tower of Dor-en-Ernil, once built by the Elves dwelling within the region. The name has also become that of the elite guard units which protect the tower, the Oathkeepers of Tirith-Aear, the most elite of the Sea-ward troops. Required to swear oaths of virtue and valour, these wardens should be of unimpeachable character. But of all the classes of the old Order, this one rotted most, with the position being given on account of blood, not valour. It will require great effort to rebuild it to its former glory. \n\nWe shall begin by dismissing those of the order known to be corrupt, and then begin searching for those worthy of this great honour." 
 decision_dol_amroth_tirith_aear_troops_confirm:0 "Speak the oaths."

 decision_dol_amroth_swan_guard_troops_desc:0 "The epitome of Númenórean valour, the Royal Order of the Silver Swan is an image of the nobility of Men at the height of their virtue. Of unmatched moral fibre and great skill in arms, only a select few are ever counted amongst this most hallowed order. To be offered such a chance is accounted an honour beyond price in the lands of Dol Amroth, and few refuse it, for it is both a great honour and a crushing duty. \n\nWith these handpicked warriors, paragons of valour and skill, the Prince has nothing to fear, for he is guarded by the most capable men in all of Dor-en-Ernil."

Autonomy, trading rights, and dignity was ours, but since the founding of the Realms-in-Exile, Pelargir has been diminished beneath kings that do not look after her interests.

Then the Strangers came out of the east. For a time we dwelt in harmony, but they grew to distrust and hate us, pushing us into the forest of Sûza Sûmar with their ever swelling numbers.

While we have lived in relative peace since its fall, our people have never reached the prosperity and wealth of that brief glorious hour, when all of Bellakar qualed before our armies, and even the Tumakveh fled before us.

Over the generations, the southern Etûlians have adopted our cultural traditions, and indeed many are akin to us by blood.

Long had it been forging in the dark smithies of Mordor, and its hideous head, founded of black steel, was shaped in the likeness of a ravening wolf; on it spells of ruin lay.

They are most fearsome weapons, commanders without peer, but they are tools for specific purposes, ill-suited for others.\n\nWith his realm arisen anew, perhaps it is time to recall the Golden King to my direct service once more..."

Too long have we destroyed ourselves, our own greatest foes. When a mighty lord dies, all too quickly his vassals abandon his heir, fighting for the scraps. We shall writ a new law of fealty and of obligation - no more shall vassals freely abandon their liege's heirs, but oaths shall endure from father to son.
