The southern forest has become a dark and twisted place, unfriendly and dangerous.\n\nBut if we can reclaim the southern forest, we can reclaim the mantle of the former kingdom of [greenwood|E].

Isildur inherited this title after his father's death, but the differences between the two kingdoms resulted in it de-facto ceasing to be after his death, with Meneldil in Gondor and Valandil in Arnor. The kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor thence charted separate courses, and separate fates. Yet it a fact - though two kingdoms, north and south, once they were one. If the crowns of both kingdoms could be brought together, perhaps they could be reunited into a single whole, as they were always meant to be."

decision_reunify_dunedain_desc:0 "Since the kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor split apart, both have developed their own distinct cultures, shaped by their long histories and the many trials both have faced. Yet both have ever been fundamentally kingdoms of the Dúnedain, proud of their high heritage. With the proclamation and solidification of the Reunited Kingdom, the boundaries which once divided the Dúnedain have fallen, and our people are united once more beneath a single crown. It will require much work to bring cultures long sundered under one once more, but given time and effort, even two peoples might once more be made one."

 decision_dol_amroth_reforms_desc:0 "Long ago the Order of the Swan was created by the Princes of Dol Amroth to act as their personal advisors and fiercest champions in battle. Filled with renowned and grizzled captains of Belfalas, the Order held itself to the highest of standards, embodying true the height of Númenórean honour and virtue...\n\nUnfortunately, however, Men are easily corrupted, and in the centuries following its original foundation the Order slowly began to decay. Bloodlines and positions at court, not valour or individual virtue, now dictate the ranks of its members, muddling the grandeur of the Order that had for so many centuries stood as a beacon for all of Gondor. If the Sons of the Silver Swan are to reclaim their legacy as the Kingdom's finest knights, the ill-festering state of the Order must be mended."

The name has also become that of the elite guard units which protect the tower, the Oathkeepers of Tirith-Aear, the most elite of the Sea-ward troops. Required to swear oaths of virtue and valour, these wardens should be of unimpeachable character. But of all the classes of the old Order, this one rotted most, with the position being given on account of blood, not valour. It will require great effort to rebuild it to its former glory. \n\nWe shall begin by dismissing those of the order known to be corrupt, and then begin searching for those worthy of this great honour."

Of unmatched moral fibre and great skill in arms, only a select few are ever counted amongst this most hallowed order. To be offered such a chance is accounted an honour beyond price in the lands of Dol Amroth, and few refuse it, for it is both a great honour and a crushing duty. \n\nWith these handpicked warriors, paragons of valour and skill, the Prince has nothing to fear, for he is guarded by the most capable men in all of Dor-en-Ernil."

 decision_anbalkumagan_annexation_tooltip:0 "Annex Etûlia, the southern part of Tulwang, into An-Balkûmagân"
 decision_anbalkumagan_annexation_desc:0 "For countless generations, Tulwang has been an area which has slipped in and out of An-Balkûmagân's control. Over the generations, the southern Etûlians have adopted our cultural traditions, and indeed many are akin to us by blood. This has led to a growing sense that Etûlia is a rightful province of An-Balkûmagân. If we can solidify our control over the area, we could formally annex the area, helping to stop us from losing our hold in the region again."

 decision_construct_tooltip:0 "Construction of the Grond Siege Unit will begin."
 decision_construct_desc:0 "Great engines crawled across the field; and in the midst was a huge ram, great as a forest-tree a hundred feet in length, swinging on mighty chains. Long had it been forging in the dark smithies of Mordor, and its hideous head, founded of black steel, was shaped in the likeness of a ravening wolf; on it spells of ruin lay. Grond they named it, in memory of the Hammer of the Underworld of old. Great beasts drew it, orcs surrounded it, and behind walked mountain-trolls to wield it."

 decision_sauron_tribute_leofring_desc:0 "From the shadows of the forest fell things come forth, striking at us, and overwhelming us like a black tide. But we have discovered that sometimes they might be placated with fine horses and gold, and leave us in peace for a time…"

They are most fearsome weapons, commanders without peer, but they are tools for specific purposes, ill-suited for others.\n\nWith his realm arisen anew, perhaps it is time to recall the Golden King to my direct service once more..."

 decision_invade_gondor_tooltip:0 "Launch an invasion that, if successful, will destroy the Southern Kingdom once and for all"
 decision_invade_gondor_desc:0 "Gondor has stood defiant against your will, Great Lord, for far too long.

 decision_reject_sauron_desc:0 "Why should I revere the Dark Lord? He abandoned Mordor and us orcs for thousands of years, fleeing like a craven coward! If that isn't proof of his fallibility, nothing is. He might be worthy of fear, but not of worship. And like every powerful being, at some point he'll stumble, and somebody stronger will take his place - perhaps it will be me!"

While it is true the region is not as interconnected as the rest of the Northern Haradrim, it's people are still kin. \n\nIf we can solidify Lurmsakun under strong Apysaic leadership, we could perhaps finally put an end to Khand's claims of lordship over the region."

 decision_greater_khand_desc:0 "In ages past, the lands of Chelkar and Nurn have paid tribute to the High-Kings of Khand. While these periods of overlordship have never lasted long, they have marked high points of Khand's influence, prosperity, and stability. \n\nIf we can bring our Nurniag brethren under our banner, and control the trade routes through Chelkar, we can perhaps formalize the greater realm of Khand not just in theory but in truth."

 decision_introduce_the_heir_tooltip:0 "Introduce your heir to your subjects"
 decision_introduce_the_heir_desc:0 "In order to consolidate the continued rule of my dynasty, considering the customs of my people, it may be prudent to call together a meeting of my vassals in which to formally introduce my heir. During this event, my vassals will be given free reign to question and challenge my heir and test their capabilities. This will give my heir a chance to win allies and prove their worthiness, so that my vassals may choose to maintain fealty to them once I am no more.\n\nHowever, these events rarely are not without their trials and risks, as my vassals will surely aim to put my heir under intense scrutiny and pressure to test their mettle. In addition, they can only be tested once - repeatedly doing such will shatter any legitimacy these contests would provide."

 decision_khand_stabilise_successions_desc:0 "For generations now, in spite of the contentious nature of succession among our people, my dynasty has managed to preserve the unity of the Variag kingdoms. Under our firm hand, our people have prospered and expanded, and now few live among our subjects who remember a day when our house did not rule supreme over them. \n\nWith this, we stand in an unprecedented position to permanently alter our people's very nature and path. Too long have we destroyed ourselves, our own greatest foes. When a mighty lord dies, all too quickly his vassals abandon his heir, fighting for the scraps. We shall writ a new law of fealty and of obligation - no more shall vassals freely abandon their liege's heirs, but oaths shall endure from father to son. With our dynasty's prestige and long-rule, while difficult, this is possible. What we have accomplished through personal valour shall now become formalized fact."

There, they ruled for many centuries, until King Eorl the young led most of them south.\n\nOur ancestors however, chose to stay behind, enchanted by the beauty of the vale. Ever since, our people have subsisted as a small coalition of clans led by the Framlings, descendents of Fram the Dragonslayer.\n\nBut with new threats rising everywhere, perhaps the time has come to reclaim what is rightfully ours.
