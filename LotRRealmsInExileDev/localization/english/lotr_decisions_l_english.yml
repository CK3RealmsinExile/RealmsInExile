 decision_restore_lossarnach_tooltip:0 "Restore the principality of Lossarnach to its former glory"
 decision_restore_lossarnach_desc:0 "Lossarnach is a strange region in Gondor. By tradition part of Lebennin, in practice more often autonomous and closely aligned with Minas Tirith and Osgiliath than Pelargir. While the Sealord has managed to wrangle us for now, if we could remove ourselves from their yoke, with a little swaying of the Lord of Minas Tirith would surely let us be elevated to similar rank, at least in honours..."

 decision_train_marines:0 "Train Pelargir Marines"
 decision_train_marines_desc:0 "As the Sealord, one of my primary duties is the management of the Royal Navy. One aspect of that is training its elite boarding troops, the marines. They are small classes, vigorously trained, but are highly effective."

 decision_integrate_andrast_desc:0 "Andrast has always been, at least in theory, a part of Gondor.

 decision_reclaim_umbar_desc:0 "For so long, Umbar has been a southern dagger pointed at Gondor's heart. For a time under the Ship-kings it was brought into the fold and was a prosperous province of the Winged Crown. If we could bring it back into the fold, our coastline would finally be secure."

 reclaim_umbar_decision:0 "The Corsair threat will finally be ended, and Umbar properly integrated into the Gondorian crown."

 ### Dol Amroth Reforms ###
 ##########################
 
 decision_dol_amroth_reforms:0 "Reform the Order of the Swan"
 decision_dol_amroth_reforms_tooltip:0 "By reforming the Order, you will gain access to advanced elite units."
 decision_dol_amroth_reforms_desc:0 "Long ago the Order of the Swan was created by the Princes of Dol Amroth to act as their personal advisors and fiercest champions in battle. Filled with renowned and grizzled captains of Belfalas, the Order held itself to the highest of standards, embodying true the height of Númenórean honour and virtue...\n\nUnfortunately, however, Men are easily corrupted, and in the centuries following its original foundation the Order slowly began to decay. Bloodlines and positions at court, not valour or individual virtue, now dictate the ranks of its members, muddling the grandeur of the Order that had for so many centuries stood as a beacon for all of Gondor. If the Sons of the Silver Swan are to reclaim their legacy as the Kingdom's finest knights, the ill-festering state of the Order must be mended."
 decision_dol_amroth_reforms_confirm:0 "Begin the training at once."
 
 decision_dol_amroth_amrothian_troops:0 "Expand the Amrothian Reserves"
 decision_dol_amroth_amrothian_troops_tooltip:0 "Begin the training of a contingent of Amrothian Reserves" 
 decision_dol_amroth_amrothian_troops_desc:0 "For years relegated to being the humblest of positions within the Order of the Swan, the Amrothian soldiery has in many ways been the group which have maintained the true spirit of the original Order the best. However, despite this, their ranks have been sadly depleted, the role viewed as lacking in honour and splendour and thus neglected. \n\nLet us work on restoring this backbone of our forces to their proper fighting strength." 
 decision_dol_amroth_amrothian_troops_confirm:0 "Begin the training at once" 
 
 decision_dol_amroth_elvish_troops:0 "Recruit the Men of Edhellond"
 decision_dol_amroth_elvish_troops_tooltip:0 "Recruit a contingent of Edhellond Knights and Rangers" 
 decision_dol_amroth_elvish_troops_desc:0 "Edhellond, once-home of the Elven domain of the same name, is one of the noblest and richest governates of Dor-en-Ernil. They strive to emulate Elven tactics in warfare, in contrast with the rest of Gondor, who maintain a firm martial tradition inherited from the days of Númenor. Their ranks amongst the Order have sat empty, oaths unsaid as the rot festered within the organization. We must make anew our oaths of old. \n\nIf they could be reintegrated into the armies of the Prince, they could serve as a powerful and innovative contingent." 
 decision_dol_amroth_elvish_troops_confirm:0 "Send our fastest rider." 
 
 decision_dol_amroth_seaward_troops:0 "Expand the Sea-ward Regiments"
 decision_dol_amroth_seaward_troops_tooltip:0 "Begin the training of a Sea-ward Regiment" 
 decision_dol_amroth_seaward_troops_desc:0 "Once the Dor-en-Ernil equal to the mighty marines of Pelargir, the Sea-ward regiments fought on the high seas and the coasts, besting corsairs and winning high honours. However, as Pelargir has risen in prominence as the heart of the Royal Navy, this guard division has dwindled to a skeleton force, maintaining a few coastal lookouts at most. \n\nIf we could expand them once more; they would once again serve us well as fearsome shock-troops." 
 decision_dol_amroth_seaward_troops_confirm:0 "Begin the training at once." 
 
 decision_dol_amroth_tirith_aear_troops:0 "Reforge the Tirith Aear"
 decision_dol_amroth_tirith_aear_troops_tooltip:0 "Begin the training of a detachment of Tirith Aear Knights" 
 decision_dol_amroth_tirith_aear_troops_desc:0 "The Tirith-Aear, or 'Sea-ward Tower' in Sindarin, is the great tower of Dor-en-Ernil, once built by the Elves dwelling within the region. The name has also become that of the elite guard units which protect the tower, the Oathkeepers of Tirith-Aear, the most elite of the Sea-ward troops. Required to swear oaths of virtue and valour, these wardens should be of unimpeachable character. But of all the classes of the old Order, this one rotted most, with the position being given on account of blood, not valour. It will require great effort to rebuild it to its former glory. \n\nWe shall begin by dismissing those of the order known to be corrupt, and then begin searching for those worthy of this great honour." 
 decision_dol_amroth_tirith_aear_troops_confirm:0 "Speak the oaths." 
 
 decision_dol_amroth_swan_guard_troops:0 "Establish the Order of the Silver Swan"
 decision_dol_amroth_swan_guard_troops_tooltip:0 "Begin the training of an elite detachment of Silver Swan Knights" 
 decision_dol_amroth_swan_guard_troops_desc:0 "The epitome of Númenórean valour, the Royal Order of the Silver Swan is an image of the nobility of Men at the height of their virtue. Of unmatched moral fibre and great skill in arms, only a select few are ever counted amongst this most hallowed order. To be offered such a chance is accounted an honour beyond price in the lands of Dol Amroth, and few refuse it, for it is both a great honour and a crushing duty. \n\nWith these handpicked warriors, paragons of valour and skill, the Prince has nothing to fear, for he is guarded by the most capable men in all of Dor-en-Ernil." 
 decision_dol_amroth_swan_guard_troops_confirm:0 "A beacon of honour, reborn."

 decision_league_of_pelargir_desc:0 "In the times of Númenor, Pelargir was pre-eminent amongst the colonies of northern Middle-Earth. Autonomy, trading rights, and dignity was ours, but since the founding of the Realms-in-Exile, Pelargir has been diminished beneath kings that do not look after her interests. We should split from the Kings and reclaim the ancient providence of all free Dúnedain to decide their own fate. Forth Pelargir, upon the waves into tomorrow!"

 decision_colonial_harnen_desc:0 "Númenor once controlled the Harnen as far as the tributary state of Al Amrûn (now known as Haruzan). If we could bring it under our control, we would have a strangle on seabound traffic entering the Bay of Belfalas. The legacy of Númenor is being reclaimed!"

 decision_harnen_kingdom:0 "Unify the Havens of Mirlond and Ramlond"
 decision_harnen_kingdom_desc:0 "For many generations, Ramlond and Mirlond have sparred over control of the riverine trade of the Harnen. However, if the two havens could be brought together under a single lord, they could achieve a stranglehold on all trade desiring to enter Harad through the Harnen.

That the Eotheod would have the same friends and foes as Gondor, and likewise the reverse. Both Steward and King swore a great oath of friendship and alliance, one which has endured to this day.\n\nNow, we are hard-pressed, and find ourselves in need of every ounce of strength.

Both sides have come to each other’s aid many times before due to this oath.\n\nNow, we find ourselves hard-pressed, and in need of aid.

We must solidify our control over the region and bring it firmly back under the House of Eorl."

 decision_construct_tooltip:0 "Construction of the Grond Siege Unit will begin."
 decision_construct_desc:0 "Great engines crawled across the field; and in the midst was a huge ram, great as a forest-tree a hundred feet in length, swinging on mighty chains. Long had it been forging in the dark smithies of Mordor, and its hideous head, founded of black steel, was shaped in the likeness of a ravening wolf; on it spells of ruin lay. Grond they named it, in memory of the Hammer of the Underworld of old. Great beasts drew it, orcs surrounded it, and behind walked mountain-trolls to wield it."
