Populated by the $sirrandrai$ [elves|E], it was ravaged during the [waroftheelvesandsauron|E], with only a few returning to those lands after its conclusion. Subsequent settlement by [dunedain|E] settlers meant that the country had only a small Elven population by the end of the [secondage|E]. With the coming of Elendil of the Dúnedain, its last rulers, Merethorn & Eliniel ceded the land and their Dúnedain subjects to him.\n\nThose times have long passed however, and the waning of the Dúnedain caused them to abandon ancient Sîrgala long ago, even before the Fall of [arnor|E].

Many tell of the rise of a necromancer that haunts the ancient ruins on top of the hill, seeking to taint the [mirkwood|E] and weaken the [elven|E] realms nearby. Some suspect this necromancer to be a mere human, dabbling in the dark arts, but we [elves|E] know this to be a greater evil.\n\n While entering the dreary forest is a perilous task, it must be done in order to reveal the true nature of the shadow that now resides within Dol Guldur.

Its raids tie up much of the men and materials of Gondor, depriving them from the war against Sauron. This cannot stand any longer. Let us rally what of the Men of Gondor will join us and neutralize this threat.\n\nUmbar is not the first port [maglor|E] has put to the torch, but Eru willing, let this be the last."

My name, and that of my family, is stained with innocent blood, which might never be cleansed. But let it not be said we did not try.

Their god either unwilling or unable to defend them, many are starting to turn away from him.

 decision_reunited_kingdom: "Proclaim the Reunited Kingdom"
 decision_reunited_kingdom_desc: "Once, the [dunedain|E] of [middleearth|E] were united under a single High-King, [elendil|E]. [isildur|E] inherited this title after his father's death, but the differences between the two kingdoms resulted in it de-facto ceasing to be after his death, with Meneldil in [gondor|E] and Valandil in [arnor|E]. The kingdoms of [GetTitleByKey('e_arnor').GetNameNoTier] and [GetTitleByKey('e_gondor').GetNameNoTier] thence charted separate courses, and separate fates. Yet it a fact - though two kingdoms, north and south, once they were one.

With the proclamation and solidification of [GetTitleByKey('e_reunitedkingdom').GetNameNoTier], the boundaries which once divided the Dúnedain have fallen, and our people are united once more beneath a single crown.

 decision_reclaim_royal_lineage_desc: "Througout the [thirdage|E], the male lines of [isildur|E] and Anárion have dwindled, and the thrones of [arnor|E] and [gondor|E] have been left vacant. While our line did not always pass from father to son, did [elendil|E] himself not descend from a King's daughter?

 decision_dol_amroth_reforms_desc: "Long ago the Order of the Swan was created by the Princes of Dol Amroth to act as their personal advisors and fiercest champions in battle. Filled with renowned and grizzled captains of Belfalas, the Order held itself to the highest of standards, embodying true the height of Númenórean honour and virtue...\n\nUnfortunately, however, Men are easily corrupted, and in the centuries following its original foundation the Order slowly began to decay. Bloodlines and positions at court, not valour or individual virtue, now dictate the ranks of its members, muddling the grandeur of the Order that had for so many centuries stood as a beacon for all of Gondor. If the Sons of the Silver Swan are to reclaim their legacy as the Kingdom's finest knights, the ill-festering state of the Order must be mended."

 decision_dol_amroth_amrothian_troops_desc: "For years relegated to being the humblest of positions within the Order of the Swan, the Amrothian soldiery has in many ways been the group which have maintained the true spirit of the original Order the best. However, despite this, their ranks have been sadly depleted, the role viewed as lacking in honour and splendour and thus neglected. \n\nLet us work on restoring this backbone of our forces to their proper fighting strength."

They strive to emulate Elven tactics in warfare, in contrast with the rest of Gondor, who maintain a firm martial tradition inherited from the days of Númenor. Their ranks amongst the Order have sat empty, oaths unsaid as the rot festered within the organization. We must make anew our oaths of old. \n\nIf they could be reintegrated into the armies of the Prince, they could serve as a powerful and innovative contingent."

However, as Pelargir has risen in prominence as the heart of the Royal Navy, this guard division has dwindled to a skeleton force, maintaining a few coastal lookouts at most. \n\nIf we could expand them once more; they would once again serve us well as fearsome shock-troops."

The name has also become that of the elite guard units which protect the tower, the Oathkeepers of Tirith-Aear, the most elite of the Sea-ward troops. Required to swear oaths of virtue and valour, these wardens should be of unimpeachable character. But of all the classes of the old Order, this one rotted most, with the position being given on account of blood, not valour. It will require great effort to rebuild it to its former glory. \n\nWe shall begin by dismissing those of the order known to be corrupt, and then begin searching for those worthy of this great honour." 
 decision_dol_amroth_tirith_aear_troops_confirm: "Speak the oaths."

 decision_dol_amroth_swan_guard_troops_desc: "The epitome of Númenórean valour, the Royal Order of the Silver Swan is an image of the nobility of Men at the height of their virtue. Of unmatched moral fibre and great skill in arms, only a select few are ever counted amongst this most hallowed order. To be offered such a chance is accounted an honour beyond price in the lands of Dol Amroth, and few refuse it, for it is both a great honour and a crushing duty. \n\nWith these handpicked warriors, paragons of valour and skill, the Prince has nothing to fear, for he is guarded by the most capable men in all of Dor-en-Ernil."

Through long years have we fought against the descendants of the Sea-kings - the [southerndragonarmyadunaic|E], who have enslaved our miserable kin - but now we are scattered, with petty chieftains vying for some little semblance of power.

Without the power of the [stormking|E], the Adûnâi have grown weak and impotent, and yet they still clutch onto the yoke with the last vestiges of their strength. More and worse, they have grown crueler since the restoration of our kingdom, and whatever of our kinsmen that have not been destroyed by their new deprativies are bleeding from a sharper lash, keen with new sadism.\n\nWe cannot assail the Stormhost in entire - but we shall chip away at the chains that hold our kinsmen.

Scattered and bickering, their power has waned while we have grown strong and free, united as one people against the menace out of the West. Now is the time for me to proclaim Zajawêlâi, the Zaja of the Coasts, and to unite my kinsmen for good, whatever may come."

 decision_refound_qadjajar_desc: "Over 2000 years ago the Katajate of Qadjajar fell before a resurgent Bellakar. While we have lived in relative peace since its fall, our people have never reached the prosperity and wealth of that brief glorious hour, when all of Bellakar qualed before our armies, and even the Tumakveh fled before us.

 decision_anbalkumagan_empire_desc: "Once, An-Balkûmagân stood as the mightiest colony south of Umbar, controlling Tulwang through its tributaries and its southern boundary formed by the citadel of Azarîdêth in Kharadûnê. However, in the wake of the War of the Renegades, the colony was greatly reduced - stripped of Tulwang, and its southern settlements in Kharadûnê carved off into the new colonial principality of Zimrathâni.\n\nThough An-Balkûmagân rose again in power and might, it has never succeeded in retaking all these lands. If we do, we could proclaim the great realm of Anbalûkkhôr fully restored!"

 decision_anbalkumagan_annexation_tooltip: "Annex Etûlia, the southern part of Tulwang, into An-Balkûmagân"
 decision_anbalkumagan_annexation_desc: "For countless generations, Tulwang has been an area which has slipped in and out of An-Balkûmagân's control. Over the generations, the southern Etûlians have adopted our cultural traditions, and indeed many are akin to us by blood. This has led to a growing sense that Etûlia is a rightful province of An-Balkûmagân. If we can solidify our control over the area, we could formally annex the area, helping to stop us from losing our hold in the region again."

Tûlwang is the Seventh Realm of Thâni-Hazâd, yet today it is seen by many as an extension of a greater Bôzishnarûd realm, therefore, now that we have established a firm grip in Tûlwang, it is important to ensure that the world recognises this region as ours."

We let them live on their own, in their minor polities and squabbling tribes, and now they talk about a King in the Forest, and resistance. And we have seen it spread to our own servants - but I will not let this stand.\n\nFor too long have we stood upon these western shores, proud and noble, under the service of the King of Men. We are the Adûnâi, and our strength comes from Zigûr himself. We are the Masters of the World. We will not allow these upstarts to humble us - we shall put them in their place!"

 decision_construct_desc: "Great engines crawled across the field; and in the midst was a huge ram, great as a forest-tree a hundred feet in length, swinging on mighty chains. Long had it been forging in the dark smithies of Mordor, and its hideous head, founded of black steel, was shaped in the likeness of a ravening wolf; on it spells of ruin lay. Grond they named it, in memory of the Hammer of the Underworld of old. Great beasts drew it, orcs surrounded it, and behind walked mountain-trolls to wield it."

They are most fearsome weapons, commanders without peer, but they are tools for specific purposes, ill-suited for others.\n\nWith his realm arisen anew, perhaps it is time to recall the Golden King to my direct service once more..."

This will give my heir a chance to win allies and prove their worthiness, so that my vassals may choose to maintain fealty to them once I am no more.\n\nHowever, these events rarely are not without their trials and risks, as my vassals will surely aim to put my heir under intense scrutiny and pressure to test their mettle.

Too long have we destroyed ourselves, our own greatest foes. When a mighty lord dies, all too quickly his vassals abandon his heir, fighting for the scraps. We shall writ a new law of fealty and of obligation - no more shall vassals freely abandon their liege's heirs, but oaths shall endure from father to son. With our dynasty's prestige and long-rule, while difficult, this is possible. What we have accomplished through personal valour shall now become formalized fact."

 decision_wulf_marriage_dunlending: "Seek to Strengthen Position in Dunland"
 decision_wulf_marriage_dunlending_tooltip: "Help Éira of Dáthabha secure her vengence and take her daughter's hand in marriage to secure an ally among the Dunlendings."
 decision_wulf_marriage_dunlending_desc: "The tale of [GetTitleByKey('d_dathabha').GetNameNoTier] is one of loss and injustice. Once ruled by Áiddan, a noble lord of the Dunlendings, its lands fell into disarray after he was slain in an ambush by [GetTitleByKey('c_isengard').GetHolder.GetFirstName], the usurper who now rules from the tower in the secluded Vale of [GetTitleByKey('c_isengard').GetNameNoTier]. He left behind two children, a son too small to lift a blade, and his daughter, Brina, now newly of age. Their mother, [GetTitleByKey('d_dathabha').GetHolder.GetMother.GetFirstName], burns with vengeance, desperate to reclaim what was stolen and see Haed brought low for his treachery, but she hasn't the strength to see it done.\n\nBy offering my support to march on Isengeàrd, I could claim Haed’s stronghold for myself as part of the bargain. In return, I would secure an alliance through marriage to Brina, binding her family’s cause to my own.\n\nSuch a union would strengthen my standing among the Dunlendings, and secure a stronghold on Rohan’s borders - a keystone for my future plans."
 decision_wulf_marriage_dunlending_confirm: "I will take Isengeàrd and secure Brina’s hand."
 decision_wulf_marriage_dunlending_effects1: "#V You#! and #V [GetTitleByKey('d_dathabha').GetHolder.GetName]#! start a "Conquest" [war|E] for #V [GetTitleByKey('c_riverwatch').GetName]#! and #V [GetTitleByKey('c_isengard').GetName]#!."
 decision_wulf_marriage_dunlending_effects2: "If successful, you will be given control of the #V [GetTitleByKey('d_isengard').GetName]#! and Brina's hand in [marriage|E], securing an [alliance|E] with the #V [GetTitleByKey('d_dathabha').GetName]#!."

 decision_wulf_marriage_rohan: "Secure the Allegiance of Marshal Thorne"
 decision_wulf_marriage_rohan_tooltip: "Convince Marshal Thorne of your cause to secure his daughter's hand and his allegiance."
 decision_wulf_marriage_rohan_desc: "Among the scattered lords of Rohan, few watch the shifting tides of power as closely as Thorne of the Wold. A marshal of the northern frontier, he is a man of quiet ambition and sharp cunning, his lands rugged and far from the King’s gaze. While his strength is modest, Thorne harbours little love for Helm and has much to gain should the Riddermark fall.\n\nThorne is an opportunist at heart. Should I declare war on Rohan and show the upper hand, he may well defect to my side without further incentive. Yet, I could secure his loyalty now by promising him greater power under my rule and forging a bond through marriage to his family.\n\nLeofwyn, his daughter, is renowned for her beauty. Marrying her would not only win me Thorne’s support but also strengthen my claim to the throne. A Rohirrim bride would quiet doubts among the lords of the Mark, lending my rule the legitimacy of the old bloodlines I seek to reclaim."
 decision_wulf_marriage_rohan_confirm: "Our interests align, how could he say no?"
 decision_wulf_marriage_rohan_effects1: "#V You#! will attempt to negotiate a secret alliance with #V [GetTitleByKey('d_thewold').GetHolder.GetName]#! to join your side in your future war for Rohan."
 decision_wulf_marriage_rohan_effects2: "As part of these negotiations, you may seek to marry his daughter, Leofwyn."

 decision_wulf_marriage_saralain: "Secure an Alliance with the Saralain"
 decision_wulf_marriage_saralain_tooltip: "Provide military aid to Pedrogh of the Saralain to secure his daughter's hand in marriage."
 decision_wulf_marriage_saralain_desc: "Uncle Cerith has spoken of his cousin [GetTitleByKey('k_saralain').GetHolder.GetFirstName], lord of the Saralain, and the troubles that press upon him. His ambition is bold - seeking to command both banks of the Gwathló - but his southern neighbours have united, their alliances blocking his path.\n\nIf I were to help him break the deadlock, Cerith believes Pedrogh would grant me his daughter’s hand, sealing an alliance through blood and marriage.\n\nAlthough the Saralain have long been sundered from the Dunlendings, our people share a kindred bond, and there is wisdom in forging alliances both beyond and within."
 decision_wulf_marriage_saralain_confirm: "Gather the men, we ride for Súthure!"
 decision_wulf_marriage_saralain_effects1: "#V You#! and #V [GetTitleByKey('k_saralain').GetHolder.GetName]#! start "County Conquest" [wars|E] against his neighbours to secure the #V [GetTitleByKey('d_nen_gwathlo').GetName]#!."

 decision_wulf_marriage_eredrim: "Secure an Alliance with the Eredrim"
 decision_wulf_marriage_eredrim_tooltip: "Send a messenger to Adorn of the Eredrim to secure his daughter's betrothal."
 decision_wulf_marriage_eredrim_desc: "My father once spoke of the Eredrim, the proud mountain lords who dwelt on the western borders of his realm. Among them, none were as feared or respected as [GetTitleByKey('d_hairavercien').GetHolder.GetFirstNameNicknamed] - a man of towering stature and unyielding will, whose name is known even beyond the [whitemountains|E].\n\nAdorn has a daughter, young Aliz, barely more than a child but already spoken of for her sharp wit and promising strength. A marriage to her would be one of opportunity, not love. The years between us, and the vast differences in our ways, would make such a union challenging.\n\nWinning Adorn’s favour would bring a powerful ally to my cause, but it is no easy feat. The Eredrim’s scorn for outsiders runs deep, and Adorn’s respect is earned only through trials that would humble lesser men. Yet, if I am to rise, even the highest mountain must be climbed."
 decision_wulf_marriage_eredrim_confirm: "Gather my escort, tell him to wear warm furs."
 decision_wulf_marriage_eredrim_effects1: "#V You#! will travel to meet #V [GetTitleByKey('d_hairavercien').GetHolder.GetName]#! to request the betrothal, though he is likely to require some convincing."
 decision_wulf_marriage_eredrim_effects2: "If successful, you will be given his daughter's hand in [marriage|E], securing an [alliance|E] with the #V [GetTitleByKey('d_hairavercien').GetName]#!."

 decision_wulf_marriage_hold_out_for_hera: "Hold Out for Héra"
 decision_wulf_marriage_hold_out_for_hera_tooltip: "Forego the opportunity to take a wife in favour of waiting for Héra"
 decision_wulf_marriage_hold_out_for_hera_desc: "Héra, the daughter of King [GetTitleByKey('k_rohan').GetHolder.GetFirstName], was once my closest friend. As children, we would play together in the golden fields of the Mark, our laughter echoing through the hills. Those days are long gone, yet the memories remain, untouched by the bitter years that followed. I hold great fondness for her still, though it is a sentiment I fear she does not share.\n\nNow, the gulf between us is vast. Her father stands as my sworn enemy, the man who spilled my father’s blood. My quest for vengeance can have done little to endear me to her, and yet, I cannot abandon the hope that her heart might one day change.\n\nThis path offers no allies and no strength in the present, but to marry Héra would be to wed the royal line of Eorl itself. If I could achieve the impossible and claim her hand, it would grant me a legitimacy no blade or army could match."
 decision_wulf_marriage_hold_out_for_hera_confirm: "I will find my way back to Héra."
 decision_wulf_marriage_hold_out_for_hera_effects: "You make a quiet vow to turn away any other offer of [marriage|E] in order to seek Héra's hand once you take Rohan."

 decision_wulf_declare_king_of_dunland: "Unite the Dunlendings"
 decision_wulf_declare_king_of_dunland_tooltip: "Whether through persuasion or the clash of steel, unite the Dunlendings under your banner."
 decision_wulf_declare_king_of_dunland_desc: "To bring Rohan to its knees, I must first unite the Dunlendings - ancient enemies of the Mark, scattered and divided by feuds and old grievances.\n\nThey must stand together, bound by purpose, whether through persuasion or the clash of steel. Only then will I have the strength to challenge Rohan, to shatter its pride, and to claim its throne as my own."

 decision_wulf_conversion_desc: "The waters of Loch Thiar shimmer beneath the moonlight, a sacred site where the spirits of Dunland are said to dwell. Though I now hold this place, the people still see me as an outsider, my ways foreign and strange. If I am to lead them, a public act of devotion could shift their hearts—making them more sympathetic to my cause and proving that my allegiance lies with them, not their age-old enemies, the Rohirrim.\n\nYet, such a step carries risks. To embrace their ways may alienate the lords of Rohan, making it harder to win their support for my claim to the throne. It is a gamble, one that might shape my path to power - or hinder it."
