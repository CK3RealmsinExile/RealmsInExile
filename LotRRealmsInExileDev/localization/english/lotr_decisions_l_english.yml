 decision_dol_amroth_reforms_tooltip:0 "By reforming the Order, you will gain access to advanced elite units."
 decision_dol_amroth_reforms_desc:0 "Long ago the Order of the Swan was created by the Princes of Dol Amroth to act as their personal advisors and fiercest champions in battle. Filled with renowned and grizzled captains of Belfalas, the Order held itself to the highest of standards, embodying true the height of Númenórean honor and virtue...\n\nUnfortunately, however, Men are easily corrupted, and in the centuries following its original foundation the Order slowly began to decay. Bloodlines and positions at court, not valor or individual virtue, now dictate the ranks of its members, muddling the grandeur of the Order that had for so many centuries stood as a beacon for all of Gondor. If the Sons of the Silver Swan are to reclaim their legacy as the Kingdom's finest knights, the ill-festering state of the Order must be mended."
 decision_dol_amroth_reforms_confirm:0 "Begin the training at once."
 
 decision_dol_amroth_amrothian_troops:0 "Expand the Amrothian Reserves"

 decision_dol_amroth_amrothian_troops_desc:0 "For years relugated to being the most humble of positions within the Order of the Swan, the Amrothian soldiery has in many ways been the group which have maintained the true spirit of the original Order the best. However, in spite of this, their ranks have been sadly depleted, the role viewed as lacking in honor and splendor and thus neglected. \n\nLet us work on restoring this backbone of our forces to their proper fighting strength." 
 decision_dol_amroth_amrothian_troops_confirm:0 "Begin the training at once" 
 
 decision_dol_amroth_elvish_troops:0 "Recruit the Men of Edhellond"
 decision_dol_amroth_elvish_troops_tooltip:0 "Recruit a contingent of Edhellond Knights and Rangers" 
 decision_dol_amroth_elvish_troops_desc:0 "Edhellond, once-home of the Elven domain of the same name, is one of the noblest and richest governates of Dor-en-Ernil. They strive to emulate Elven tactics in warfare, in contrast with the rest of Gondor, who maintain a firm martial tradition inherited from the days of Númenor. Their ranks amongst the Order have sat empty, oaths unsaid as the rot festered within the organization. We must make anew our oaths of old. \n\nIf they could be reintegrated into the armies of the Prince, they could serve as a powerful and innovative contingent." 
 decision_dol_amroth_elvish_troops_confirm:0 "Send our fastest rider." 
 
 decision_dol_amroth_seaward_troops:0 "Expand the Sea-ward Regiments"
 decision_dol_amroth_seaward_troops_tooltip:0 "Begin the training of a Sea-ward Regiment" 
 decision_dol_amroth_seaward_troops_desc:0 "Once the Dor-en-Ernil equal to the mighty marines of Pelargir, the Sea-ward regiments fought on the high seas and the coasts, besting corsairs and winning high honors. However, as Pelargir has risen in prominence as the heart of the Royal Navy, this guard division has dwindled to a skeleton force, maintaining a few coastal lookouts at most. \n\nIf we could expand them once more, they would once again serve us well as fearsome shock-troops."

 decision_dol_amroth_tirith_aear_troops_desc:0 "The Tirith-Aear, or 'Sea-ward Tower' in Sindarin, is the great tower of Dor-en-Ernil, once built by the Elves dwelling within the region. The name has also become that of the elite guard units which protect the tower, the Oathkeepers of Tirith-Aear, the most elite of the Sea-ward troops. Required to swear oaths of virtue and valor, these wardens should be of unimpeacheable character. But of all the classes of the old Order, this one rotted most, with the position being given on account of blood, not valor. It will require great effort to rebuild it to its former glory. \n\nWe shall begin by dismissing those of the order known to be corrupt, and then begin searching for those worthy of this great honor." 
 decision_dol_amroth_tirith_aear_troops_confirm:0 "Speak the oaths." 
 
 decision_dol_amroth_swan_guard_troops:0 "Establish the Order of the Silver Swan"
 decision_dol_amroth_swan_guard_troops_tooltip:0 "Begin the training of an elite detachment of Silver Swan Knights" 
 decision_dol_amroth_swan_guard_troops_desc:0 "The epitome of Númenórean valor, the Royal Order of the Silver Swan is an image of the nobility of Men at the height of their virtue. Of unmatched moral fibre and great skill in arms, only a select few are ever counted amongst this most hallowed order. To be offered such a chance is accounted an honor beyond price in the lands of Dol Amroth, and few refuse it, for it is both a great honor and a crushing duty. \n\nWith these handpicked warriors, paragons of valor and skill, the Prince has nothing to fear, for he is guarded by the most capable men in all of Dor-en-Ernil." 
 decision_dol_amroth_swan_guard_troops_confirm:0 "A beacon of honour, reborn." 

 decision_construct_grond:0 "Construct Grond"
 decision_construct_tooltip:0 "Construction of the Grond Siege Unit will begin."
 decision_construct_desc:0 "Great engines crawled across the field; and in the midst was a huge ram, great as a forest-tree a hundred feet in length, swinging on mighty chains. Long had it been forging in the dark smithies of Mordor, and its hideous head, founded of black steel, was shaped in the likeness of a ravening wolf; on it spells of ruin lay. Grond they named it, in memory of the Hammer of the Underworld of old. Great beasts drew it, orcs surrounded it, and behind walked mountain-trolls to wield it."
 decision_construct_confirm:0 "The Hammer of the Underworld shall lay low all whom hinder its destructive power."
 decision_construct_tool_tip_2:0 "Construction of the Grond Siege Unit will begin"
 grond:0 "Grond"
 grond_flavor:0 "A battering ram of monstrous size, tapped with a wolf's head of black iron, Grond was the weapon with which Sauron would breach the walls of Minas Tirith.

 decision_sauron_tribute_policy_desc:0 "As befits your eminence and might, emissaries come from near and far bearing gifts and signs of submission to your power and authority, be it gold and trinkets or men to serve him.

 decision_invade_gondor_tooltip:0 "Launch an invasion that, if successful, will destroy the Southern Kingdom once and for all"
 decision_invade_gondor_desc:0 "Gondor has stood defiant against your will, Great Lord, for far too long. If we can secure Ithilien as a point of attack against it, we could amass such an army that even Minas Tirith itself could not resist. And if Minas Tirith falls, then Gondor shall be leaderless, and fracture."

 decision_search_orthanc_desc:0 "The Tower of Orthanc has for centuries served as Saruman's dwelling, resulting in many things both strange and wondrous likely being hoarded within. We should assemble a search party to see what he might have hidden within those bleak, ancient halls."

 decision_restore_lossarnach_tooltip:0 "Restore the principality of Lossarnach to its former glory"
 decision_restore_lossarnach_desc:0 "Lossarnach is a strange region in Gondor. By tradition part of Lebennin, in practice more often autonomous and closely aligned with Minas Tirith and Osgiliath than Pelargir. While the Sealord has managed to wrangle us for now, if we could remove ourselves from their yoke, with a  little swaying of the Lord of Minas Tirith would surely let us be elevated to similar rank, at least in honors..."

 decision_reject_sauron_desc:0 "Why should I revere the Dark Lord? He abandoned Mordor and us orcs for thousands of years, fleeing like a craven coward! If that isn't proof of his fallibility, nothing is. He might be worthy of fear, but not of worship. And like every powerful being, at some point he'll stumble, and somebody stronger will take his place - perhaps it will be me!"
