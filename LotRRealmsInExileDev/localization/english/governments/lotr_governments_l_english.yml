 steward_government:0 "Stewardship"
 steward_government_desc:0 "The hereditary title of "Ruling Steward" was created in the wake of King Earnur's demise as a way to maintain order in the absense of a Rightful King. The office was in all respects and purposes akin to a kingship, although out of respect the Rulings Stewards never sat on the throne of the King; instead, resigning themselves to a simple chair of black stone placed below it."
