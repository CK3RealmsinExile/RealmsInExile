 ritual_success.1000.t: "Dark Ritual: A Success!"
 ritual_success.1000.horde.a.desc: "From the dark and gloomy hills they come. Warriors to serve you, and to fight in your name. \n\nLooking down upon your new troops, you feel a dark satisfaction at your mastery of the dark arts - from your own power, legions have arisen!"
 ritual_success.1000.horde.b.desc: "Your troops stand alert and ready as the final sigils are inscribed. Now bearing runes of power and might, your symbol upon their breasts, they shall fight with twice the strength as before!"
 ritual_success.1000.horde.c.desc: "A warrior of black cunning and fell strength stands before you, a bloodied corpse at his feet. \n\n"I have heard your call, my lord, and have come to offer my blade! Behold the proof of my fealty." \n\nWith such a warrior at the head of your armies, your host has become more fearsome than ever before."
 ritual_success.1000.summon.a.desc: "From the depts of the tombs they rise. The dead, shaking and cold, grasp their swords, now inhabited by dark spirits in your service. These wraiths shall need no blades, for fear alone shall surely strike your enemies down!"
 ritual_success.1000.summon.b.desc: "With a last murmured word of Black Speech, the seal is complete. The watchers at the gate of your fortress have been bound and sealed, and their malice will serve as a shield were stone fails."
 ritual_success.1000.summon.c.desc: "From the skies a screech comes, and like a black whirlwind the beast comes. A fellbeast, one of the mounts of the Dark Lord himself! Fast and strong, it is a steed without peer, and a sign of your favor before the Ruinous Powers."
 ritual_success.1000.powerspell.a.desc: "The earth crackles and breaks beneath your words, great pits hollowed out from which foul armaments and troops will soon gush forth. Your levees have increased, and with nary a cost to yourself!"
 ritual_success.1000.powerspell.b.desc: "You have undertaken the most profane and sinful of acts. On a dark alter, you have strapped down your courtier, and slowly you begin to chant, until it is a howl that shakes the room. \n\nThen - they shudder, and fall, and you feel a heady, rich sensation, like you have drank of the finest of wines. Suddenly you feel revitalized, younger, virile and strong! \n\nYou turn around and stride forth, leaving behind a withered husk behind on the alter for your servants to clean up."
 ritual_success.1000.powerspell.c.desc: "With black words of darkess malice, you see in your mind the fortifications of your foe. You see the stones, carefully established and piled one atop the other, and the earth which they are all piled upon. Summoning all your intent, you speak words of breaking, of falling, of ruin and desolation, and then - there is a tumble, and a crash, and the halls of your foe crumbles before your might."
 ritual_success.1000.craft.a.desc: "A Morgul-blade... a foul tool, and one difficult to create. Dark runes upon it, it is brutally cold to the touch, and it inspires dread and wariness upon all who gaze upon it. Forged in a crucible of blood and suffering, with a handle wrought of bone, it is a tool with which to break even the most stalwart."
 ritual_success.1000.lamentation.a.desc: "Terror is a tool more powerful than any other. So struck by fear, many will do whatever you bid, simply to escape that heart-rending terror... how simple it is, in the end."
 ritual_success.1000.lamentation.b.desc: "Slinking in the night, you come across your target. Your very presence itself plunges the temperature of the room, and you swiftly assail them. No need for weapons, not tonight - a touch alone, and they shall be made helpless, and your foes leaderless. The Black Breath claims another victim."
 ritual_success.1000.lamentation.c.desc: "Back from the darkness of impotence, you come. Back to serve your master once more. There is no escape from his service. Not even death."
 ritual_success.1000.treachery.a.desc: "You dazzle and charm, a kindly smile upon your face and a warmness in every action. A lie, a falsehood, a tool to get your foes to lower their guard. But a potent one anyway. Such folly - to continue to hope and hold out for reproachment, even when you should know better... Let them relax for the moment, content in your apparent goodwill. Your time shall come."
 ritual_success.1000.treachery.b.desc: "It is a strange thing, to take the form of another. You tower over your normal body, muscled and hulking, furred and imposing, like a Werewolf of the First Age. Such potency in your hands! Such strength in your form! Let your enemies beware: now, you hunt the greatest game..."
 ritual_success.1000.treachery.c.desc: "In the darkness, you divine all foes, all plots arrayed against you. And at last, you see it, and all becomes so clear - how your foes machinate against you, even among your own court! Rising, you set off to bring this traitor to account..."
 ritual_success.1000.darkness.a.desc: "From your lair issues forth a dark cloud, a shade which cripples crops and demoralizes men. Under that dread night the damned and depraved march, wreaking havoc wherever they go."
 ritual_success.1000.darkness.b.desc: "A cold wind is the first sign. Then, snow and a deep despair, one which saps all will to move or to make. Your foes are crippled, barely able to survive the bitter cold, let alone assail you! And you laugh, and laugh again, sitting before your warm hearth, relishing the unimagineable suffering you have wrought."
 ritual_success.1000.darkness.c.desc: "It starts, as it always does, with a minor thing. A member of the court tired, then one passing away silenty in the night - surely nothing major, just a natural occurrence. Well, then it happens. All at once, the courts of your foes beging to flail in panic, shutting themselves away in desperation to avoid the curse, nay the plague, which has fallen on them. Such discord can only be to your benefit..."
 ritual_success.1000.a: "Most excellent"

 ritual_success.1001.t: "Dark Ritual: Failure"
 ritual_success.1001.desc: "The power that is being vested into the ritual recoils. It takes a moment to realize that you have failed in your attempts. This is not what I have in mind...""
 ritual_success.1001.a: "Very well, I shall try again."
