 numenorean_desc:0 "The Númenóreans, known in Adunaic as the Adûnâim, were the men who inhabited the isle of Elenna, Isle of the Star, known also as Westernesse, Númenórë, and Anadûnê. Taught by the Maia Eönwë and the Elves of Tol Eressëa in many crafts and arts, the Númenóreans grew strong in the peace of Númenor, and in time their kingdom became the preeminent power of the Second Age. Elsewhere much has been written of the tragic decline and tyranny of the Númenóreans, before Númenor was cast down in the Akallabêth. In the Third Age, the term is largely used in a historical context, with those of Númenórean descent in Middle-Earth being known as the Dúnedain."

Proud mariners and loremasters by tradition, of late Gondor has evermore had to raise its people into soldiers, for the Kingdom has need of such soldiers. The shield of the west, the tower of Minas Tirith stands defiant against all who would seek to shackle the heirs of Númenor, and all peoples free."

Yet from sorrow the Arnorians learned wisdom, and in some ways, they are wiser now than even their Númenórean forebears.
