In time though peace prevailed, and they united to form a new people under the mythical first High-Chief, the Targadh-Arm.\n\nIn the later second age, the tribes of the Noi Trevan would be subjugated by Dúnedain petty-kingdoms, founded by ambitious adventurers who shattered the ancient kingdom of the nine-tribes.

For a time there was peace, but after Arnor shattered relations between the Dúnedain of Rhudaur and the Noi Trevan slowly degraded to the point of no return. Then the Hillmen, with the support of Angmar, rose up against the Dúnedain, claiming their ancient homeland for their own once more.\n\nBut the Hillmen had but exchanged the sceptre of Arnor for the iron chains of Angmar, who bled them white against the armies of Arnor and took their grain to feed its armies.

 arysisani_desc:0 "#size:15    The Arysori are sometimes considered the easternmost of the Haradrim tribes, but having long been the first contact upon the northern routes in Khy they have greatly intermingled and been influenced by the cosmopolitan and settled Khyans, assimilating many of their cultural and religious traditions. Because of this, other Haradrim tribes often view them as ‘tainted’ or ‘soft’, particularly in their religious philosophy of tranquility, trade, and co-existence. The lack of any sort of martial tradition has resulted in the Arysori largely dividing along clan lines, with any sort of larger polity having been a weaker confederation for the purposes of arbitration and trade rather than military action.#"

Once their domains had been larger, but as the great jungle of Harad turned to waste after the War of Wrath, they increasingly became a constrained - and belligerent - people. The Nafarati are at their heart a warrior culture, and have often quarreled with the wealthy and settled Bôzishnarûd to their west. Despite their fractious nature they seem indifferent to who rules over them, so long as it gives them the excuse to live by the sword.#"
