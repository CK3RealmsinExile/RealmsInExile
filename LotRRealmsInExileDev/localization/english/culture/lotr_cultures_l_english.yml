 bulchyadean_desc: "#size:15    The Bulchyadeans are the proud inhabitants of the northern coast of the Bay of Ormal. Akin in origin to the Khyans to the north, they are Easterling in origin, descended from those who pushed all the way to the sea, where they mixed more heavily with the native Apysans of the region. The first among the Khailûza to adopted a settled lifestyle, the Bulchyadeans left their pastoral ways and began to build great coastal cities in the mid [secondage|E], as the darkness fell upon their kin to the north. Diverging even more from their northern relatives under [numenorean|E] tutelage, the Bulchyadeans became sailors and fishermen, earning a living from the vibrant waters of the Bay. After the [downfall|E] they rose to become great mariners in their own right, as the disparate cities of the coast banded together into the Bulchyadean league to challenge Anarikêan dominance of the Bay. This on again off again rivaly would persist, even as the League was absorbed into the rising Imperial Khy and Anarikê fell under foreign dominion time and again, with the Bay of Ormal remaining a dynamic and contested water long into the [thirdage|E].\n\nThe people of the Bulchaydean cities are uniquely similar and distinct from those of the Khyans heartland. First to establish themselves and long proudly independent, they nevertheless have seen great expansion of Khyan influence since the foundation of the Empire. In the later days of the [thirdage|E], while the elders still complain of foreign encroachment and cultural suppression, it is not uncommon to see the latest Khyan fashions, foods, or families upon the cosmopolitan streets of Jorash, or for a visitor to heard more the courtly speech of Pelepelplu than the burly dialect of Kantilya. Despite increasing Khyan assimilation, the people of the Bulchyades are still renowned for their mercantile skill, keen minds, and sharper tongues, and their continued self-sufficiency and communal pride.#!"

Shelepinn claimed that as the eldest, the crown was her's by right. The younger, Tûlanal, argued that leadership passed from father to son. The Kinn-lai were irreconcilably divided, and the coming of Men further aggravated the issue. For Tûlanal gained the friendship of the great young Chief of the incoming Men - Amâv. And Tûlanal used this friendship as an example of why he should lead them. For her part, Shelepinn argued that he lightly gave away their ancient homelands in exchange for a friendship that would die with Amâv. Both would ultimately be proven right - while long did the Kîrani maintain friendship, the Mûmakani in time fell back into the Shadow which even then lurked over them.\n\nIt seemed to all that blood would be shed, when at last Shelepinn proved herself the nobler, saying that she would take those who would follow her and build a realm her own, away from her brother's. And so their folk divided, and never again were united.
