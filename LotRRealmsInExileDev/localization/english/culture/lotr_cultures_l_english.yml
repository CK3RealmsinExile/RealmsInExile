In the early and middle [secondage|E], two sets of tribes migrated into [rhudaur|E], three from [angmar|E] and six from the lower Gwathló river.

In time though peace prevailed, and they united to form a new people under the mythical first High-Chief, the Targadh-Arm.\n\nIn the later [secondage|E], the tribes of the Noi Trevan would be subjugated by [dunedain|E] petty-kingdoms, founded by ambitious adventurers who shattered the ancient kingdom of the nine-tribes. These petty-kings swore fealty to Elendil of [arnor|E], and so the Hillmen were bound up with the fate of the Northern Kingdom. For a time there was peace, but after Arnor shattered relations between the Dúnedain of Rhudaur and the Noi Trevan slowly degraded to the point of no return. Then the Hillmen, with the support of Angmar, rose up against the Dúnedain, claiming their ancient homeland for their own once more.\n\nBut the Hillmen had but exchanged the sceptre of Arnor for the iron chains of Angmar, who bled them white against the armies of Arnor and took their grain to feed its armies. By the end of the [angmar_wars|E], the Hillmen had been all but wiped out - not by the vengeance of Arnor, but by the callousness of Angmar.#"
