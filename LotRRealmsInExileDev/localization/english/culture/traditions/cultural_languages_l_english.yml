 language_quenya_name:0 "Quenya"
 language_quenya_desc:0 "The dominant [elven|E] language of the [uttermostwest|E], Quenya can be split into three dialects: Valinorean, Vanyar and Exilic.\n\nValinorean Quenya is the dialect originally spoken by the [noldorelves|E], and after the Exile preserved by those who remained in Valinor.\n\nVanyarin Quenya is the dialect spoken by the Vanyar of Valimar. It is the dialect with the most Valarin influence, yet otherwise the most conservative of the dialects, since they were less innovative than the Noldor.\n\nExilic Quenya (also known as Noldorin Quenya), was spoken by the [noldorelvesexiles|E]. This was the dialect of Quenya which saw the greatest change, and the dialect of Quenya taken by the [dunedain|E] of [numenor|E] and later the [realms_in_exile|E].\n\nThe language of the Teleri of Valinor, Telerin, is sometimes considered a branch of Quenya."

 language_westron_desc:0 "Westron, or Adûni, is a creole language of Adûnaic and the languages of the Middle Men of [middleearth|E]. Westron was formed in the northern colonies of [numenor|E], where Adûnaic was viewed as tainted by the [faithful|E] due to its association with the [kingsmen|E]. As a result, there was little attempt to preserve the language, causing it to evolve more due to this neglect.\n\nFollowing the [downfall|E], the exiles of Númenor enlarged and enriched Westron with many [elvish|E] loanwords, mostly from Númenórean Sindarin. Due to the influence of the [dunedain|E], Westron became known as Common Speech in the Westlands due to its popularity, with [dwarves|E], [orcs|E] and [elves|E] speaking the tongue itself or a closely related dialect."

Southern Westron has significant Umbarean Adûnaic influence, which results in much of the language's Adûnaic derived vocabulary having a hint Northern Apysaic, rather than Middle Men like the Westron of Gondor and the Northmen. Southern Westron came into existance after the conquest of Umbar by Eärnil I, as many Gondorian colonists came to inhabit the new province, they brought Westron with them, slowly displacing the old Umbarean Adûnaic dialect, although it took on many words and pronouncations from it."
 
 language_westron_orc_name:0 "Orcish Westron"

Often their speech is peppered with Orcish curses or shouts, like #italicskai, sha,#! or #italic garn#!. Though unlovely, those who speak Westron may understand it to some extent... though many wish they could not."

 language_orcish_desc:0 "While [orcs|E] do not have a unified language structure, they do indeed share the practice of composing their daily speech from corrupted borrowings from the languages of [middleearth|E], with Westron and Black Speech being the most common languages they borrow for the Orcish speech. The variations in Orcish between different tribes and types of Orc were so great that it was often useless for communication, as different tribes would adapt to the languages of the peoples that surrounded them. In particular, the western orcs often used Westron as their tongue between tribes on account of this."

During their migration westward, the tongue was influenced by both the Avarin and the Dwarven Khuzdul. By the time the two tribes arrived to Beleriand, their tongues had diverged significantly, with Bëorian Taliska incorporating far more Elven elements than Hadoric Taliska.\n\nThe Bëorians largley abandoned their own branch of Taliska upon settling in Beleriand, adopting Sindarin.

After the return of the [noldorelvesexiles|E] to [middleearth|E], Elu Thingol, king of the Sindar, banned the usage of Quenya in his domains. While this proclamation had little practical power to bind the Noldor, the Elves of Beleriand were also slower to learn Quenya than the Noldor Sindarin. As a result, Quenya slowly fell out of use and became a language of lore, with Sindarin becoming the dominant elven tongue.\n\nThe establishment of [sindarelves|E] kingdoms in [greenwoodshort|E] and [lothlorien|E] caused the Silvan Elves of Mirkwood and Nandor Elves of Lórien to adopt Sindarin. The Sindarin of [greenwoodshort|E] integrated many Silvan elements, forming a unique dialect.\n\nThe Númenóreans of Andustar adopted Sindarin for their daily speech, being descendants of the Bëorians, who had abandoned their own native dialect of Taliska. This gave birth to the [numenorean|E] Sindarin dialect, which survived in Gondor and Arnor following the Akallabêth."

Rhovanian was recognised by the Kings of [gondor|E] as similar to Westron, sharing Taliska as a common ancestor, and thus the [northmen|E] of Rhovanion were recognised as Middle Men, friendly to Gondor. The Rhovanian tongues have also influenced the languages of many peoples of Rhovanion, such as the [longbeard|E] [dwarves|E] and the Ioriags."

Over the recent years, the language has influenced the tongues spoken in the lands surrounding the Isen river, with the Adornaen people speaking a mixture between Rohirric and Gwathuilach due to their connection to [rohan|E]."

Little is known about the Avarin tongue, yet it is related to the other Elven tongues through the common ancestor of Primitive Quendian. When the Avari split, their language did so as well, with three major branches being formed; North, East and West.\n\nDue to its proximity to the [eldar|E] of [greenwoodshort|E], the West Avarin dialect shared some similarities with the languages of the Silvan elves, such as loanwords.\n\nThe Eastern Avarin dialect was the most spoken of the dialects, due to the majority of the Avarin migrating East with some of them  being the ones that migrated to the far south.\n\nThe Northern Avarin dialect is the most peculiar of the lot, having no intial consonant groups, it is considered the most isolated of the dialects, with some even doubting its existance."

Although Khyan infulence waned, the language gradually replaced the native tounges of eastern Siryan, becoming the primary form of communication along the Sîresha river, both in the courts and on the docks.
