 language_quenya_name: "Quenya"
 language_quenya_desc: "The dominant [elven|E] language of the [uttermostwest|E], [quenya|E] can be split into three dialects: Valinorean, Vanyarin, and Exilic.\n\nValinorean Quenya is the dialect originally spoken by the [noldorelves|E], and after the Exile preserved by those who remained in Valinor.\n\nVanyarin Quenya is the dialect spoken by the Vanyar of Valimar and is the dialect with the most Valarin influence.\n\nExilic Quenya (also known as Ñoldorin Quenya), was spoken by the [noldorelvesexiles|E]. This was the dialect of Quenya which saw the greatest change, and the dialect of Quenya adopted by the [dunedain|E] of [numenor|E] and later the [realms_in_exile|E].\n\nThe language of the Teleri of Valinor, Telerin, is sometimes considered a branch of Quenya."

 language_westron_name: "Westron"
 language_westron_desc: "Westron, or Adûni, is a creole language of Adûnaic and the languages of the Middle Men of [middleearth|E]. Westron was formed in the northern colonies of [numenor|E], where Adûnaic was viewed as tainted by the [faithful|E] due to its association with the [kingsmen|E]. As a result, there was little attempt to preserve the language, causing it to evolve more due to this neglect.\n\nFollowing the [downfall|E], the exiles of Númenor enlarged and enriched Westron with many [elvish|E] loanwords, mostly from Númenórean Sindarin. Due to the influence of the [dunedain|E], Westron became known as Common Speech in the Westlands due to its popularity, with [dwarves|E], [orcs|E] and [elves|E] speaking the tongue itself or a closely related dialect."

 language_westron_south_desc: "Southern Westron, also known as Southron, is the dialect of Westron spoken by the mixed descendants of the Númenóreans that inhabit the lands south of the Poros river. Southern Westron has significant Umbarean Adûnaic influence, which results in much of the language's Adûnaic derived vocabulary having a hint of Northern Apysaic, rather than Middle Men like the Westron of Gondor and the Northmen. Southern Westron came into existance after the conquest of Umbar by Eärnil I, as many Gondorian colonists came to inhabit the new province, they brought Westron with them, slowly displacing the old Umbarean Adûnaic dialect, although it took on many words and pronunciations from it."
 
 language_westron_orc_name: "Orcish Westron"
 language_westron_orc_desc: "Orcish Westron refers to the depraved and cruel form of Westron spoken by the [orcs|E], used whenever there is inter-tribal communication - the languages of Orcs split fast and quick, though they take little care to make their words beautiful, preferring instead for their tongues to be harsh and sharp - for they cannot understand other Orcish tongues. Often their speech is peppered with Orcish curses or shouts, like #italicskai, sha,#! or #italic garn#!. Though unlovely, those who speak Westron may understand it to some extent... though many wish they could not."

 language_orcish_name: "Orcish"
 language_orcish_desc: "While [orcs|E] do not have a unified language structure, they do indeed share the practice of composing their daily speech from corrupted borrowings from the languages of [middleearth|E], with Westron and Black Speech being the most common languages they borrow for the Orcish speech. The variations in Orcish between different tribes and types of Orc were so great that it was often useless for communication, as different tribes would adapt to the languages of the peoples that surrounded them. In particular, the western orcs often used Westron as their tongue between tribes on account of this."
 
 language_kurr_name: "Kúrr"
 language_kurr_desc: "Kúrr is an obscure [orcish|E] tongue spoken by some isolated tribes in the [yellowmountains|E]. It is comprised of sharp, snappy sounds that are spit out in quick succession, forming very crude sentences. Due to the strongly echoing caverns, simple signals and commands can travel vast distances deep beneath the earth. Because of their highly tribalistic tendencies, even neighbouring groups of Orcs have difficulty understanding with eachother."
 
 language_black_speech_name: "Black Speech"
 language_black_speech_desc: "Black Speech was created by the Dark Lord [sauroncharacter|E] during the [secondage|E] to be the common language of all his servants. Black Speech is seen as a dark and evil language by the wise of [middleearth|E], and few dare to utter it, therefore, it is spoken by few outside Sauron's influence."
 
 language_taliska_name: "Taliska"
 language_taliska_desc: "Taliska was the shared ancestral tongue of the Houses of Bëor and Hador. During their migration westward, the tongue was influenced by both the Avarin and the Dwarven [khuzdul|E]. By the time the two tribes arrived to Beleriand, their tongues had diverged significantly, with Bëorian Taliska incorporating far more Elven elements than Hadoric Taliska.\n\nThe Bëorians largley abandoned their own branch of Taliska upon settling in Beleriand, adopting Sindarin. As a result, it would be Hadoric Taliska which would survive and evolve into the later tongue of [numenor|E], Adûnaic."
 
 language_adunaic_name: "High Adûnaic"
 language_adunaic_desc: "Adûnaic, known to speakers as Adûnayân, is the language spoken in the former [numenorean|E] Colonies south of the Harnen, derived from Taliska, the language of the [firstage|E] Edain. The language evolved following the [akallabeth|E], with the now independent [realms_in_exile|E] accepting foreign influences in their dialect, such as [bellakar|E] and Anarikê, or choosing to conservatively maintain the language, a practice taken by the [adunai|E] realms of [thanihazad|E]."

 language_kharadunaic_name: "Kharadûnaic" # Endonym: Kharadûnayân? Maybe the Anbalukkhôrî call it Khêruwayân, or Khôrayân. LOL!
 language_kharadunaic_desc: "Kharadûnaic, the language of the former southern colonies of Númenor such as the realms of Thâni-Hazad, it was considered the most conservative dialect of Adûnaic, due to the high amount of archaic vocabulary that had fallen out of favour in Númenor by the late Second Age. Kharadûnaic however, could also not escape minor Southern Apysaic influence, mostly in [anbalkumagan|E]."
 
 language_tanturaki_name: "Tantûraki"
 language_tanturaki_desc: "Tantûraki, known as Tanâtariyê to its speakers (and later the Ûsakani), was a dialect of Adûnaic spoken in the former [numenorean|E] colony of Tantûrak. The language of Tantûrak was very unique in nature, in part to the neglect and autonomy Tantûrak had throughout its time as a Númenórean colony, but also due to the shifting ideals and morals of the colony itself. The tongue became very derived and corrupted, taking much from the tongues of the Mûmakani.\n\nIt is also held that as the Shadow fell upon Tantûrak, the lords and governors of that land purposefully twisted their tongue to make it harsh and unlovely to the ears of outsiders and lessers, for they deemed those qualities 'strong'. As such, Tanâtariyê is one of the most unique forms of Adûnaic, hard for even the neighbouring [adunai|E] of the [thanihazad|E] to understand."
 
 language_adunaic_umbar_name: "Umbarean Adûnaic" # Originally, I thought Umbadûnayân would be the best endonym, but maybe Adûnayân 'nUmbar?
 language_adunaic_umbar_desc: "The Adûnaic spoken in [umbar|E] was the most similar to the High Adûnaic of Númenor, as it had been the colony most closely linked to the metropole, and even considered by many to be more conservative phonetically than the Adûnaic of Númenor by the late Second Age, yet the language also developed a not insignificant amount of Northern Apysaic influence - mostly in vocabulary - due to the close contact of Umbar to the Haradric trade routes and the Kingdom of Kârna."
 
 language_azulunaic_name: "Azûladûnaic" # Endonym: Azûladûnayân? Maybe just Azûlayân?
 language_azulunaic_desc: "The Eastern Adûnaic tongue, or the Old Sea-tongue, was the branch of Adûnaic speaken by the sailors and traders of [numenor|E] who inhabited its military and commercial outposts in the far east. Although due to the supremacy of Anarikê in the far east, the Eastern Adûnaic tongue became commonly known as the 'Anarikêan Dialect'.\n\nAt first it was a conservative dialect, as the Númenóreans of the far-east seldom settled in great numbers, and due to the transitory nature of the Eastern Adûnai through the entire region, no particular loan-words were adopted until their relocation to Anarikê after the Akallabêth, in which the tongue began to increasingly adopt more $language_khyan_name$ loan-words and pronunciations."

 language_sindarin_desc: "Named after the [sindarelves|E] [elves|E] of [beleriand|E], [sindarin|E] was the 'common tongue' of the Elves of the [westlands|E] of [middleearth|E].\n\nRelated to the Telerin tongue of [valinor|E], Sindarin developed in [beleriand|E] during the [yearofthetreesage|E]. After the return of the [noldorelvesexiles|E] to [middleearth|E], [elu_thingol|E], king of the Sindar, banned the usage of [quenya|E] in his domains. While this proclamation had little practical power to bind the Noldor, the Elves of Beleriand were also slower to learn Quenya than the Noldor Sindarin. As a result, Quenya slowly fell out of use and became a language of lore, with Sindarin becoming the dominant elven tongue.\n\nThe establishment of [sindarelves|E] kingdoms in [greenwoodshort|E] and [lothlorien|E] caused the Silvan Elves of Mirkwood and Nandor Elves of Lórien to adopt Sindarin. The Sindarin of Greenwood integrated many Silvan elements, forming a unique dialect.\n\nThe Númenóreans of Andustar adopted Sindarin for their daily speech, being descendants of the Bëorians, who had abandoned their own native dialect of Taliska. This gave birth to the [numenorean|E] Sindarin dialect, which survived in Gondor and Arnor following the Akallabêth."
 
 language_rhovanic_name: "Rhovanian"
 language_rhovanic_desc: "The Rhovanic tongues rose from the northern group of Taliska speaking Edain who remained in [greenwood|E] in [rhovanion|E] instead of crossing the [mistymountains|E], yet the Rhovanian tongues would also be influenced by the Baradhrim tribes that came from the East in the [secondage|E], such as the Igath. Rhovanian was recognised by the Kings of [gondor|E] as similar to Westron, sharing Taliska as a common ancestor, and thus the [northmen|E] of Rhovanion were recognised as Middle Men, friendly to Gondor. The Rhovanian tongues have also influenced the languages of many peoples of Rhovanion, such as the [longbeard|E] [dwarves|E] and the Ioriags."
 
 language_rohirric_name: "Rohirric"
 language_rohirric_desc: "Rohirric is the language spoken by the Rhovanorim who followed Marhwini into exile to the [anduinvale|E] who became the [eothed|E] peoples. The Rohirric language is derived from the [northmen|E] tongues of Rhovanion and therefore it is classified as one of the Middle Men languages due to its similarity to Westron, sharing the common ancestor of Taliska. Over the recent years, the language has influenced the tongues spoken in the lands surrounding the Isen river, with the Adornaen people speaking a mixture between Rohirric and Gwathuilach due to their connection to [rohan|E]."

 #language_avarin_desc: "Avarin is the exonym given to the languages spoken by the [elves|E] that refused to take the Great Journey to [valinor|E] or [beleriand|E] and remained in the lands of [cuivienen|E]. Little is known about the Avarin tongue, yet it is related to the other Elven tongues through the common ancestor of Primitive Quendian. When the Avari split, their language did so as well, with three major branches being formed; North, East and West.\n\nDue to its proximity to the [eldar|E] of [greenwoodshort|E], the West Avarin dialect shared some similarities with the languages of the Silvan Elves, such as loanwords.\n\nThe Eastern Avarin dialect was the most spoken of the dialects, due to the majority of the Avarin migrating East with some of them being the ones that migrated to the far south.\n\nThe Northern Avarin dialect is the most peculiar of the lot, having no initial consonant groups, it is considered the most isolated of the dialects, with some even doubting its existence."
 language_avarin_desc: "Common Avarin is not truely a language but rather a collection of diverging dialects. A general term for the diverse speach of the [avari|E] after the sundering, Common Avarin quickly splintered beyond recognition into the many and varried tongues of the [avari|E], leaving the term with little meaning beyond the histories."

 language_penni_name: "Pennia"
 language_penni_desc: "Pennia is the language of the [penni|E] [avari|E], spoken in the hidden forest of they named Nelorniath. It is the closest related to [language_group_eldarin|E] of all the [language_group_avarin|E] tongues, coming from a related dialect at [cuivienen|E] and drawing influences from the Nandorin language before contact ceased."

 language_cuind_name: "Cuendi"
 language_cuind_desc: "The [cuind|E] of Drêl name their tongue Cuendi, 'the language of the speakers'. It is unique amongst the [language_group_avarin|E] tongues for lacking the sounds 'w' and 'y', and a flowing writing system based on ink on leaves."

 language_kinnlai_name: "Kenni-lamm"
 language_kinnlai_desc: "The tongue of the Kinn-lai [avari|E], Kenni-lamm is notable for a love of compound words and its rhythmic feel."

 language_kindi_name: "Kendia"
 language_kindi_desc: "Kendia was once spoken across the wide plains of [rhun|E], and lent inspiration to many of the Easterling tongues. However, the Kindi have declined and hidden, retreating from the open sky and grassy fields where once their tongue was heard. Few [men|E] now are lucky enough to hear it spoken, ere it dies forever."

 language_hwneti_name: "Hwentya"
 language_hwenti_desc: "Hwentya is a unique language, widely diverged from all other [elven|E] tongues. Spoken in the far north of [middleearth|E], it reminds those few who know both of the High-Elven [quenya|E]. "

 language_magri_name: "Magrin"
 language_magri_desc: "Magrin is the language of the Twin Realms of Mag and Tumag, and their peoples. Scholars have had difficulties pinpointing its precise origins, for the tongue seems predominantly akin to that of the Kîrani to their east, yet it also seems to contain some archaic elements that hint towards a connection towards the Apysaic family."
 
 language_northern_apysaic_name: "Haruzusht"
 language_northern_apysaic_desc: "When the $apysaic_collective_noun$ came out of the east of East, in pursuit of the sons of [ermon|E] or in flight from the Shadow, they brought with them their myriad tongues. Those who settled in the north were the $haruze_collective_noun$, or the Godly People, and their language was the Godly Tongue, or $language_northern_apysaic_name$.\n\nThe languages of many nearby cultures were greatly influenced by the $haruze_collective_noun$, but they too were influenced by the incoming tongues of the [numenoreans|E], $language_adunaic_umbar_name$ and $language_westron_name$. As such, the $language_northern_apysaic_name$ of the [secondage|E] is barely intelligible to a $haruze$ in the [thirdage|E]. Only one word has survived for six thousand years: Melêkha." # ADD GLOSS
 
 language_karrani_name: "Karrash" # Expand, I need to know more about the Karrani HUKE!
 language_karrani_desc: "As the $apysaic_collective_noun$ ventured into the wide lands of Harad, their tribes began to diverge - so too did their tongues. Those who settled near the hills of Umbar were the $karrani$, kinsmen of the $sakalai$ and $haruze$, and their language became $language_karrani_name$.\n\nThe tongue of the $karrani$ was influenced greatly by $language_northern_apysaic_name$, but it too influenced the tongue of the $jelut_collective_noun$, and the languages of the Dune Sea. It has also left its mark on $language_adunaic_umbar_name$ and $language_westron_south_name$, with many words for sand, rock, and other land-locked geography being directly borrowed from $language_karrani_name$."

 language_middle_apysaic_name: "Apîshya"
 language_middle_apysaic_desc: "Even as they first arrived into Harad, the $apysaic_collective_noun$ were already a diverse group of peoples and tongues - so, to unite them on their great march, many of their houses spoke a common language, perhaps adopted from the mightiest of their tribes. It is said that the $arani_collective_noun$ have preserved that tongue, almost six thousand years later.\n\nThis is not the truth, but it is not too far from it. $language_middle_apysaic_name$ is possibly the least divergent of the tongues of the $apysaic_collective_noun$, which is baffling due to the various tribes, clans, and religious sects within the $arani_collective_noun$ diaspora itself, to say nothing of the neighboring cultures that also speak $language_middle_apysaic_name$. Some scholars believe that it is due to these different cults specifically that the tongue has survived - to trade in any reasonable quantity, you need to speak, and so the $harad_priest_male_plural$ teach their congregation the tongue as it must be spoken, ordained by the Gods."

 language_southern_apysaic_name: "Dalab"
 language_southern_apysaic_desc: "Of all the tongues of the $apysaic_collective_noun$ peoples, perhaps the one spread farthest is $language_southern_apysaic_name$, literally meaning 'The Tongue'. Through the stabilizing influence of the Council of Regents, on behalf of the $emperor_bozisha_miraz_male$, the $language_southern_apysaic_name$ of the $bozishnarud_collective_noun$ and their $narudbriyig_collective_noun$ neighbors has not changed much over six thousand years.\n\n$language_southern_apysaic_name$ has, however, diversified in other parts of [middleearth|E], with the $gusar_collective_noun$, $gai_collective_noun$, and $bellanarud_collective_noun$ all speaking vastly different dialects, or related languages. It has also loaned many words to the nearby $language_adunaic_bellakar_name$, and is used as a trader's tongue all over the South."
 
 language_jelut_name: "Jeludrin"
 language_jelut_desc: "$language_jelut_name$ is the language of the $jelut_collective_noun$ peoples, a tongue most related to $language_middle_apysaic_name$. It has not a few loan words from $language_karrani_name$ and $language_adunaic_umbar_name$, but otherwise it is an example of a divergent, somewhat isolated tongue in the Faríyian family of languages.\n\nHowever, $language_jelut_name$ has one more ancestral tongue, far out of place in the Harad - $language_sindarin_name$. When '$nick_the_hand_of_gurzil$' came into Umbar and subjugated the [dunedain|E], the $language_jelut_name$ language adopted some of the words and customs of the $umbaredain_collective_noun$, which survive to this day."

 language_arysan_name: "Arysan"
 language_arysan_desc: "Arysan is the language spoken by the eastern [haradrim|E]. Though it is a Haradric tongue, its structure and vocabulary borrow heavily from the $language_khyan_name$ tongue. This is a natural result of the heavy Khyan influence on the peoples of the region."
 
 language_pust_name: "Pûst"
 language_pust_desc: "When the $old_pust_collective_noun$ peoples long ago came out of the Dune Sea and wandered towards the Mirror of Fire, they brought with them one of the myriad tongues of the $apysaic_collective_noun$. Named after the people who spoke it, $language_pust_name$ is an expansive language, with a high concentration of consonant clusters.\n\nIt is said that salt-water shrivels the tongue, which may explain why $language_pust_name$ is such a hard language to understand and speak. However, it has been influenced in no small part by $language_middle_apysaic_name$, though this is mostly for the $darsalai_collective_noun$ - the $lushek_pust_collective_noun$ of the mountains have much less intelligible dialects to a speaker of $language_middle_apysaic_name$."
 
 language_gai_name: "Gái"
 language_gai_desc: "Hidden in their forest home of the same name, the $gai_collective_noun$ are an isolated people, and though their tongue is related to $language_southern_apysaic_name$, it has diverged greatly, making mutual intelligibility nearly impossible. Also, the $gai_collective_noun$ are a secretive folk, and loath to share secrets easily. As such, when they must deal with the $bozishnarud_collective_noun$, they deign to learn and use $language_southern_apysaic_name$ instead of revealing their secret tongue to the outside world."
 
 language_ansith_name: "Ansith"
 language_ansith_desc: "Nearly the farthest removed of all $apysaic_collective_noun$-descended languages, $language_ansith_name$ is the tongue of the $heritage_tulwangi_collective_noun$ peoples, but over time it has changed greatly in all of the cultures of that varied group.\n\nIn $k_tulwang$ and [anbalkumagan|E], $language_kharadunaic_name$ has greatly influenced the $tuladen_collective_noun$, $tandi_collective_noun$, and $banadunai_collective_noun$ who live there, with the most boot-licking of the $heritage_tulwangi_collective_noun$ attempting to copy the accents of the $anbalukkhori_collective_noun$ to endear themselves to their masters. The $tuloriyan_collective_noun$ are even further influenced, with their dialects carrying the influence of $language_tedjin_name$ and $language_adunaic_bellakar_name$. Meanwhile, in $k_zajantak$, the $fariyin_collective_noun$ have kept a more 'pure' form of the language, insofar as non-Apysaic influence goes, though not a few words are borrowed from $language_southern_apysaic_name$."

 language_amutani_name: "Amutanin"
 language_amutani_desc: "Amutanin is somewhat of an outlier among the Apysaic family, owing to its long seperation and isolated state - the only other Apysaic tongue it has contact with is $language_ansith_name$, and in very limited form. Spoken in the far southwest of [middleearth|E], it combines the basic Aypsaic core with layers of borrowings from $language_magri_name$, $language_kharadunaic_name$, and even $language_cuind_name$. At first glance some might take it to be unique, grown out of the very stones of the [thanihazad|E], to which it suits so well."

 language_hobbitish_desc: "Hobbitish is the dialect of Westron spoken by the [halflings|E] of the [shire|E]. The language was adopted after the end of the Wandering Days, when their migration into [arnor|E] brought them into contact with Westron, the Common Speech, which they begun speaking with loanwords from their old tongue, which had been influenced by the Rhovanian tongues, therefore, the Hobbitish tongue shares many linguistic similarities with the Northern tongues."

 language_khyan_name: "Khyan"

 language_anarikean_name: "Anarikêan"
 language_anarikean_desc: "The Anarikêan Language is a vernacular of Adûnaic, which is better known as the Old Sea-Tongue by the local folk, and $language_khyan_name$, although being more related to the latter rather than the former. It is most strongly spoken in the urban and coastal areas of Anarikê, where the legacy of Númenor in their speech remains strong, with loan-words and pronunciations borrowed from Adûnaic. However, any speaker of Adûnaic would not recognise the Anarikêan Tongue as Adûnaic, for it had become its own, unique, and interesting dialect."

 language_new_sirayni_name: "Nabhâsh"
 language_new_sirayni_desc: "The Nabhâsh tongue, or New-Speech is the language of Sîrayn in the Third Age. Influenced by $language_middle_apysaic_name$ and $language_pust_name$, with hints of $language_southern_apysaic_name$ and $language_muranian_name$, Nabhâsh is the lingua franca across the western Bay of Ormal, with many regional dialects and linguistic quirks for each tribe and culture. But the language has not changed overmuch - a Bulgan may speak with an Aytan and each will, at least haltingly, understand the other."

 language_old_sirayni_name: "Âkabhâsha"
 language_old_sirayni_desc: "Âkabhâsha, or First-Speech, is the language of the longfathers of the Sîraynê, the Sîreshni, when they first entered the Bay of Ormal, speaking in many varying tongues, naming new things as they ventured further and further south. In the waxing days of the Sîreshni, each city-state had its own dialect and linguistic tradition. But with the assault of Khôrahîl and subsequent integration with the Arani, the many tongues of Âkabhâsha were forgotten or changed, save in withering tomes of old and forgotten lore."

 language_muranian_name: "Muranian"

 language_elinse_name: "Elinse"
 language_elinse_desc: "Elinse, the language of the people who share the same name, is an Apysaic tongue - but it is far removed from any of the other languages in that group, for they alone of the Haradrim did not venture into the southwest of Harad, instead choosing to go east, near the Bay of Ormal. As such, while nominally Apysaic, the language of the Elinse is near-incomprehensible to their sundered Haradrim brethren."

 language_lyneri_name: "Lynîr"
 language_lyneri_desc: "Lynîr is a tongue come out of Mûmakan, for the Lyneri are related to the people of that peninsula. However, through many years of contact, trade, and marriage with the other cultures around the Bay of Ormal, the Lynîr tongue has adopted many loanwords from $language_khyan_name$, Nabhâsh, and especially Tazinain, due to their close proximity."

 language_tazinain_name: "Tazinain"
 language_tazinain_desc: "Tazinain is the lingua franca in the coastlands of Sîrayn. It was in origin a Talathrim dialect of [khy|E], akin to those spoken among the folk of the Bulchaydes, and spread by trade and conquest during the years of Khy's Golden Age. Although $language_khyan_name$ infulence waned, the language gradually replaced the native tounges of eastern Sîryan, becoming the primary form of communication along the Sîresha river, both in the courts and on the docks. It was heavilly enriched and expanded with local vocabulary, and is now nearly as much Sîraynic in origin as Khyan."

It was heavily influenced by the dragon Utumkôdur, thus its name.\n\nIt has historically been used as a common trade tongue throughout the Eastern Seas, and many other languages in the region have Soelâsi loan-words. \n\nSoelâsi has evolved over the eras, to the point where the Third Age Womaw referred to the second age tongue as Soelâsi Bu, or 'Old Womarin'. The tongues of Lokhas and Vulmaw were based on this older dialect."
