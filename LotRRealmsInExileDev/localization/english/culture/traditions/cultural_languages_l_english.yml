 language_quenya_name: "Quenya"
 language_quenya_desc: "The dominant [elven|E] language of the [uttermostwest|E], Quenya can be split into three dialects: Valinorean, Vanyar and Exilic.\n\nValinorean Quenya is the dialect originally spoken by the [noldorelves|E], and after the Exile preserved by those who remained in Valinor.\n\nVanyarin Quenya is the dialect spoken by the Vanyar of Valimar. It is the dialect with the most Valarin influence, yet otherwise the most conservative of the dialects, since they were less innovative than the Noldor.\n\nExilic Quenya (also known as Noldorin Quenya), was spoken by the [noldorelvesexiles|E]. This was the dialect of Quenya which saw the greatest change, and the dialect of Quenya taken by the [dunedain|E] of [numenor|E] and later the [realms_in_exile|E].\n\nThe language of the Teleri of Valinor, Telerin, is sometimes considered a branch of Quenya."

 language_westron_name: "Westron"
 language_westron_desc: "Westron, or Adûni, is a creole language of Adûnaic and the languages of the Middle Men of [middleearth|E]. Westron was formed in the northern colonies of [numenor|E], where Adûnaic was viewed as tainted by the [faithful|E] due to its association with the [kingsmen|E]. As a result, there was little attempt to preserve the language, causing it to evolve more due to this neglect.\n\nFollowing the [downfall|E], the exiles of Númenor enlarged and enriched Westron with many [elvish|E] loanwords, mostly from Númenórean Sindarin. Due to the influence of the [dunedain|E], Westron became known as Common Speech in the Westlands due to its popularity, with [dwarves|E], [orcs|E] and [elves|E] speaking the tongue itself or a closely related dialect."

 language_westron_south_name: "Southron"
 language_westron_south_desc: "Southern Westron, also known as Southron, is the dialect of Westron spoken by the mixed descendants of the Númenóreans that inhabit the lands south of the Poros river. Southern Westron has significant Umbarean Adûnaic influence, which results in much of the language's Adûnaic derived vocabulary having a hint Northern Apysaic, rather than Middle Men like the Westron of Gondor and the Northmen. Southern Westron came into existance after the conquest of Umbar by Eärnil I, as many Gondorian colonists came to inhabit the new province, they brought Westron with them, slowly displacing the old Umbarean Adûnaic dialect, although it took on many words and pronouncations from it."
 
 language_westron_orc_name: "Orcish Westron"
 language_westron_orc_desc: "Orcish Westron refers to the depraved and cruel form of Westron spoken by the [orcs|E], used whenever there is inter-tribal communication - the languages of Orcs split fast and quick, though they take little care to make their words beautiful, preferring instead for their tongues to be harsh and sharp - for they cannot understand other Orcish tongues. Often their speech is peppered with Orcish curses or shouts, like #italicskai, sha,#! or #italic garn#!. Though unlovely, those who speak Westron may understand it to some extent... though many wish they could not."

 language_orcish_name: "Orcish"
 language_orcish_desc: "While [orcs|E] do not have a unified language structure, they do indeed share the practice of composing their daily speech from corrupted borrowings from the languages of [middleearth|E], with Westron and Black Speech being the most common languages they borrow for the Orcish speech. The variations in Orcish between different tribes and types of Orc were so great that it was often useless for communication, as different tribes would adapt to the languages of the peoples that surrounded them. In particular, the western orcs often used Westron as their tongue between tribes on account of this."
 
 language_kurr_name: "Kúrr"
 language_kurr_desc: "Kúrr is an obscure [orcish|E] tongue spoken by some isolated tribes in the Yellow Mountains. It is comprised of sharp, snappy sounds that are spit out in quick succession, forming very crude sentences. Due to the strongly echoing caverns, simple signals and commands can travel vast distances deep beneath the earth. Because of their highly tribalistic tendencies, even neighbouring groups of Orcs have difficulty understanding with eachother."
 
 language_black_speech_name: "Black Speech"
 language_black_speech_desc: "Black Speech was created by the Dark Lord [sauroncharacter|E] during the [secondage|E] to be the common language of all his servants. Black Speech is seen as a dark and evil language by the wise of [middleearth|E], and few dare to utter it, therefore, it is spoken by few outside Sauron's influence."
 
 language_taliska_name: "Taliska"
 language_taliska_desc: "Taliska was the shared ancestral tongue of the Houses of Bëor and Hador. During their migration westward, the tongue was influenced by both the Avarin and the Dwarven Khuzdul. By the time the two tribes arrived to Beleriand, their tongues had diverged significantly, with Bëorian Taliska incorporating far more Elven elements than Hadoric Taliska.\n\nThe Bëorians largley abandoned their own branch of Taliska upon settling in Beleriand, adopting Sindarin. As a result, it would be Hadoric Taliska which would survive and evolve into the later tongue of [numenor|E], Adûnaic."
 
 language_adunaic_name: "High Adûnaic"
 language_adunaic_desc: "Adûnaic is the language spoken in the former [numenorean|E] Colonies south of the Harnen, derived from Taliska, the language of the [firstage|E] Edain. The language evolved following the [akallabeth|E], with the now independent [realms_in_exile|E] accepting foreign influences in their dialect, such as [bellakar|E] and Anarikê, or choosing to conservatively maintain the language, a practice taken by the [adunai|E] realms of [thanihazad|E] and Tantûrak."
 
 language_adunaic_bellakar_name: "Belladûnaic"
 language_adunaic_bellakar_desc: "Bellakari Adûnaic is the dialect of Adûnaic spoken in the former Númenórean colonies of Bellakar, it is one of the most diverged dialects of Adûnaic, being described as mixed as their heritage. The language can be further subdivided into a Northern and Southern Dialect, with the former having more Tedjin influence and the latter having more Bôzishnarûd influence."
 
 language_kharadunaic_name: "Kharadûnaic"
 language_kharadunaic_desc: "Kharadûnaic, the language of the former southern colonies of Númenor such as the realms of Thâni-Hazad and Tantûrak, considered the most conservative dialect of Adûnaic, due to the high amount of archaic vocabulary that had fallen out of favour in Númenor by the late Second Age. Kharadûnaic however, could also not escape minor Southern Apysaic influence, mostly in [anbalkumagan|E]."
 
 language_adunaic_umbar_name: "Umbarean Adûnaic"
 language_adunaic_umbar_desc: "The Adûnaic spoken in [umbar|E] was the most similar to the High Adûnaic of Númenor, as it had been the colony most closely linked to the metropole, and even considered by many to be more conservative phonetically than the Adûnaic of Númenor by the late Second Age, yet the language also developed a not insignificant amount of Northern Apysaic influence - mostly in vocabulary - due to the close contact of Umbar to the Haradric trade routes and the Kingdom of Kârna."
 
 language_azulunaic_name: "Azûladûnayân"
 language_azulunaic_desc: "Azûladûnayân, also known as the Eastern Adûnaic tongue, which was commonly referred to as the Anarikêan Dialect, or the Old Sea-tongue, was the branch of Adûnaic speaken by the sailors and traders of Númenor who inhabited its military and commercial outposts in the far east, although due to the biggest being Anarikê, the Eastern Adûnaic tongue became commonly known as the 'Anarikêan Dialect'.\n\nAt first it was a conservative dialect, as the Númenóreans of the far-east seldom settled in great numbers, and due to the transitory nature of the Eastern Adûnai through the entire region, no particular loan-words were adopted until their relocation to Anarikê after the Akallabêth, in which the tongue began to increasingly adopt more Khyan loan-words and pronouncations."

 language_anarikean_name: "Anarikêan"
 language_anarikean_desc: "The Anarikêan Language is a vernacular of Adûnaic - better known as the Old Sea-tongue by the local folk - and Khyan, though it is more related to the latter. It is mostly spoken in the urban and costal areas of Anarikê, where the legacy of Númenor in their speech remains strongest, such that not a few of their words and pronouncations are borrowed from Adûnaic. However, any speaker of High Adûnaic, or even other divergent tongues like Westron or Kharadûnaic, would not recognise the Anarikêan Tongue, for it has become its own unique and interesting dialect."

 language_sindarin_name: "Sindarin"
 language_sindarin_desc: "Named after the [sindarelves|E] [elves|E] of [beleriand|E], Sindarin was the 'common tongue' of the Elves of the [westlands|E] of [middleearth|E].\n\nRelated to the Telerin tongue of Valinor, Sindarin developed in Beleriand during the [yearofthetreesage|E]. After the return of the [noldorelvesexiles|E] to [middleearth|E], Elu Thingol, king of the Sindar, banned the usage of Quenya in his domains. While this proclamation had little practical power to bind the Noldor, the Elves of Beleriand were also slower to learn Quenya than the Noldor Sindarin. As a result, Quenya slowly fell out of use and became a language of lore, with Sindarin becoming the dominant elven tongue.\n\nThe establishment of [sindarelves|E] kingdoms in [greenwoodshort|E] and [lothlorien|E] caused the Silvan Elves of Mirkwood and Nandor Elves of Lórien to adopt Sindarin. The Sindarin of [greenwoodshort|E] integrated many Silvan elements, forming a unique dialect.\n\nThe Númenóreans of Andustar adopted Sindarin for their daily speech, being descendants of the Bëorians, who had abandoned their own native dialect of Taliska. This gave birth to the [numenorean|E] Sindarin dialect, which survived in Gondor and Arnor following the Akallabêth."
 
 language_rhovanic_name: "Rhovanian"
 language_rhovanic_desc: "The Rhovanic tongues rose from the northern group of Taliska speaking Edain who remained in [greenwood|E] in [rhovanion|E] instead of crossing the [mistymountains|E], yet the Rhovanian tongues would also be influenced by the Baradhrim tribes that came from the East in the [secondage|E], such as the Igath. Rhovanian was recognised by the Kings of [gondor|E] as similar to Westron, sharing Taliska as a common ancestor, and thus the [northmen|E] of Rhovanion were recognised as Middle Men, friendly to Gondor. The Rhovanian tongues have also influenced the languages of many peoples of Rhovanion, such as the [longbeard|E] [dwarves|E] and the Ioriags."
 
 language_rohirric_name: "Rohirric"
 language_rohirric_desc: "Rohirric is the language spoken by the Rhovanorim who followed Marhwini into exile to the [anduinvale|E] who became the [eothed|E] peoples. The Rohirric language is derived from the [northmen|E] tongues of Rhovanion and therefore it is classified as one of the Middle Men languages due to its similarity to Westron, sharing the common ancestor of Taliska. Over the recent years, the language has influenced the tongues spoken in the lands surrounding the Isen river, with the Adornaen people speaking a mixture between Rohirric and Gwathuilach due to their connection to [rohan|E]."

Little is known about the Avarin tongue, yet it is related to the other Elven tongues through the common ancestor of Primitive Quendian. When the Avari split, their language did so as well, with three major branches being formed; North, East and West.\n\nDue to its proximity to the [eldar|E] of [greenwoodshort|E], the West Avarin dialect shared some similarities with the languages of the Silvan elves, such as loanwords.\n\nThe Eastern Avarin dialect was the most spoken of the dialects, due to the majority of the Avarin migrating East with some of them  being the ones that migrated to the far south.\n\nThe Northern Avarin dialect is the most peculiar of the lot, having no intial consonant groups, it is considered the most isolated of the dialects, with some even doubting its existance."

The language was adopted after the end of the Wandering Days, when their migration into Arnor brought them into contact with Westron, the Common Speech, which they begun speaking with loanwords from their old tongue, which had been influenced by the Rhovanian tongues, therefore, the Hobbitish tongue shares many linguistic similarities with the Northern tongues."

 language_new_sirayni_name: "Nabhâsh"
 language_new_sirayni_desc: "The Nabhâsh tongue, or New-Speech is the language of Sîrayn in the Third Age. Influenced by Arani and Pûst, with hints of Bôzishnara and Muranian, Nabhâsh is the lingua franca across the western Bay of Ormal, with many regional dialects and linguistic quirks for each tribe and culture.

In the waxing days of the Sîreshni, each city-state had its own dialect and linguistic tradition. But with the assault of Khôrahîl and subsequent integration with the Arani, the many tongues of Âkabhâsha were forgotten or changed, save in withering tomes of old and forgotten lore."

 language_elinse_name: "Elinse"
 language_elinse_desc: "Elinse, the language of the people who share the same name, is an Apysaic tongue - but it is far removed from any of the other languages in that group, for they alone of the Haradrim did not venture into the southwest of Harad, instead choosing to go east, near the Bay of Ormal. As such, while nominally Apysaic, the language of the Elinse is near-incomprehensible to their sundered Haradrim brethren."

 language_lyneri_desc: "Lynîr is a tongue come out of Mûmakan, for the Lyneri are related to the people of that peninsula. However, through many years of contact, trade, and marriage with the other cultures around the Bay of Ormal, the Lynîr tongue has adopted many loanwords from Khyan, Nabhâsh, and especially Tazinain, due to their close proximity."

 language_tazinain_name: "Tazinain"
 language_tazinain_desc: "Tazinain is the lingua franca in the coastlands of Sîrayn. It was in origin a Talataerim dialect of Khy, akin to those spoken among the folk of the Bulchaydes, and spread by trade and conquest durring the years of Khy's Golden Age. Although Khyan infulence waned, the language gradually replaced the native tounges of eastern Siryan, becoming the primary form of communication along the Sîresha river, both in the courts and on the docks. It was heavilly enriched and expanded with local vocabulary, and is now nearly as much Sîraynic in origin as Khyan."

It was heavily influenced by the dragon Utumkôdur, thus its name.\n\nIt has historically been used as a common trade tongue throughout the Eastern Seas, and many other languages in the region have Soelâsi loan-words. \n\nSoelâsi has evolved over the eras, to the point where the Third Age Womaw referred to the second age tongue as Soelâsi Bu, or 'Old Womarin'. The tongues of Lokhas and Vulmaw were based on this older dialect."
