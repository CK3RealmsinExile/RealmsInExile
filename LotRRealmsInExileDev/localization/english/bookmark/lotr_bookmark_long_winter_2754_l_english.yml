  bm_2754_rohan:0 "War of the Rohirrim"
  bm_2754_rohan_desc:0 "An hour of devastation looms. In the north, Helm Hammerhand, Lord of the Riddermark, summons a council that may drastically change the face of Rohan, and may lead to his ultimate doom. Yet now the Rohirrim cannot look to their staunchest allies for aid.\n\nIn the south, legions of Haradrim and fleets of corsairs muster with newfound vigour, seeking to plunder the rich underbelly of Gondor, and Beren of Gondor must ready his realm for the threat. Unbeknownst to them all, the Long Winter approaches; and to the people of the North it shall bring nothing but misery and suffering.\n\nCan Gondor and Rohan withstand the onslaught, or has the fortune of the Free Peoples turned against them?"

  bookmark_long_winter_freca_desc:0 "Freca, Lord of the Westmarch and the Adorn, is a man of mixed heritage. Claiming descent from King Fréawine of Rohan, Freca is also kin to the Dunlendings which the Rohirrim have long feuded with. Though theoretically a vassal of King Helm, he has long ignored the royal summons and decrees of his titular overlord. For Freca has grown both rich and powerful. \n\nBut King Helm is growing old, and Freca's heir in the prime of his youth - and so a scheme is born. Helm has an unwed daughter, and surely he cannot refuse Freca's aid with his great troubles..."

  bookmark_long_winter_helm_hammerhand_desc:0 "Ninth King of the House of Eorl, Helm has proven himself a strong leader in the fifteen years since his crowning. Since the days of his grandfather Déor, the struggles with the Dunlendings on the western borders of the realm have intensified. His vassals there are stretched thin, or of... questionable loyalty.\n\nAs is his custom, Helm now prepares to call another council of his vassals, to discuss the affairs of the realm. Yet this council shall prove fateful for Helm and all his children..."

  bookmark_long_winter_bountig_medlokan_desc:0 "Bountig Medlokan is one among a sea of many who eke out a living upon the golden, windswept steppes of Rhûn. A person of soaring ambition and low circumstance, the young Bountig is a sellsword, and his company musters for a raid against Rohan, lured in by the promise of plunder. Yet though he may seem an indigent mercenary, Bountig's ambition is rivalled only by his will. Beyond this petty war, there is much, much more for him. He knows it.\n\nCan Bountig unite the squabbling tribes and clans of Rhûn and build a new realm to rival the splendour of Gondor and Harwan, or shall he be another footnote in the tale of the Golden Lands?"

Then Nár turned the head and saw branded on the brow in Dwarf-runes so that he could read it the name AZOG.”#!\n\nLong have the squabbling bands and tribes of the Misty Mountains been disarrayed, ever at war, for that is the nature of Orcs - to fight until a great power unites them.\n\nBut now a new chieftain, Azog, fresh and hale and full of guile, has come to rule Moria, greatest of all the mansions of the Dwarves. From this place, Azog readies his fighting-orcs, clad in steel and iron, for he has great ambitions - he will unite the scattered Goblins of the Misty Mountains, and then no power in the North can stand against him!\n\nHis armies are growing, his sons are strong and hale. Soon, all the mountains shall bow at his feet. There is a new Power in the North, and his name is Azog!"
