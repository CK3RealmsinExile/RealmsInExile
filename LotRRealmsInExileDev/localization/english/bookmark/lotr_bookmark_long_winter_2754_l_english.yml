  bm_2754_rohan:  "War of the Rohirrim"
  bm_2754_rohan_desc:  "An hour of devastation looms. In the north, Helm Hammerhand, Lord of the Riddermark, summons a council that may drastically change the face of Rohan, and may lead to his ultimate doom. Yet now the Rohirrim cannot look to their staunchest allies for aid.\n\nIn the south, legions of Haradrim and corsair fleets muster with newfound vigour, seeking to plunder the rich underbelly of the Southern Kingdom, and Beren of Gondor must ready his realm for the threat. Unbeknownst to them all, the Long Winter approaches; and to the people of the North it shall bring nothing but misery and suffering.\n\nCan Gondor and Rohan withstand the onslaught, or has the fortune of the Free Peoples turned against them?"

  bookmark_long_winter_freca_desc:  "Freca, Lord of the Westmarch and the Adorn, is a man of mixed heritage. Claiming descent from King Fréawine of [rohan|E], Freca is also kin to the [dunlendings|E] which the [rohirrim|E] have long feuded with. Though theoretically a vassal of King Helm, he has long ignored the royal summons and decrees of his titular overlord. For Freca has grown both rich and powerful. \n\nBut King Helm is growing old, and Freca's heir in the prime of his youth - and so a scheme is born. Helm has an unwed daughter, and surely he cannot refuse Freca's aid with his great troubles..."

Since the days of his grandfather Déor, the struggles with the [dunlendings|E] on the western borders of the realm have intensified. His vassals there are stretched thin, or of... questionable loyalty.\n\nAs is his custom, Helm now prepares to call another council of his vassals, to discuss the affairs of the realm. Yet this council shall prove fateful for Helm and all his children..."

  bookmark_long_winter_bountig_desc:  "Bountig Medlókan is one among a sea of many who eke out a living upon the windswept steppes of [rhun|E]. Born into low circumstance and cast to the winds by tragedy, the young Bountig now is a sellsword. He has heard word of a great raid to the west against [rohan|E], one which promises much wealth and glory to those who take the risk. Yet though he may seem an indigent mercenary, Bountig's resilience is matched by his will and vision. Beyond this petty war, there is more for him. He knows it.\n\nCan Bountig unite the squabbling tribes and clans of [rhun|E] and build a new realm to rival the splendour of [gondor|E] and Haradwaith, or shall he be another footnote in the tale of the Great Steppe?"

He is not a man of great stature nor valor, nor is he skilled in arms, nor is his personality fiery and impudent. Yet Beren is a man who serves his people and subjects with honor, and whether he knows it or not, he shall face a mighty trial. In the south, the [haradrim|E] under the rising realm of Harwan prepare to wage war against the [southernkingdom|E] by land and sea, and in this they are aided by their [Concept('umbar','corsair')|E] vassals. This shall define the reign of Beren son of Egalmoth, and the diligence of his character.\n\nCan Beren hold off the Haradrim and corsair forces, or shall Harondor at last be wrested from Gondor's control?"

The [witchkingshort|E] of [angmar|E], Lord of the [Concept('ninenazgul','Nine')|E], chief lieutenant and captain of [sauroncharacter|E], prepares the land for his arrival. Already he has done much; the barren wastelands of the north are under the control of the [nazgul|E], and the [Concept('nurn','Núrniags')|E] with their vast slave-populated fields feed the armies of Mordor. But there is still work to be done, both within and without, if the Black Tower is to rise once more.\n\nWill the Witch-King prepare Mordor for the [darklord|E]'s ultimate return, or will he be thwarted in his effort?"

His liege, ruler of the mightiest empire of the [haradrim|E] in many generations, prepares to unleash an assault  upon [gondor|E] to retake the contested land of Harondor. While Hûssammâkir invades from the south, Ârunarû shall take to the seas, aiming to bleed the coasts of the [southkingdom|E] dry.\n\nWill Arûnarû be able to claim the riches of Gondor for himself, or shall he be driven back into the sea?"

The scion of mighty men who forged a new [haradrim|E] empire, Hûssammâkir now rules at an apogee. Yet he does not sit idle. Harondor still belongs to hated [gondor|E], and for many years the Haradrim have planned to assail their northern enemy by land and sea alike.

However, a threat looms over the northern horizon, threating to once again deprive Durin's Folk of all their new-found riches.\n\nAs the winter arrives, only trials are on the winds for the peoples of the north."
