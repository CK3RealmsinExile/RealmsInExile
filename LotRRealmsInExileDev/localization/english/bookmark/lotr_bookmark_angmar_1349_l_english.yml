 # Rise of Angmar 
 bm_1349_angmar: "Rise of the Witch-King"
 bm_1349_angmar_desc: "#TOLKIENQUOTE: "It was in the beginning of the reign of Malvegil of Arthedain that evil came to Arnor. For at that time the realm of Angmar arose in the North beyond the Ettenmoors. Its lands lay on both sides of the Mountains, and there were gathered many evil men, and Orcs, and other fell creatures.#!\n#QUOTEDCHARACTER: - Eriador, Arnor, and the Heirs of Isildur#!\n\nArnor. The northern kingdom of the Dúnedain, long sundered and broken between competing claims, now stands on the brink, perhaps, of unity. Argeleb of Arthedain has ascended the throne, and claimed for himself the throne of all Arnor, citing the end of the line of Isildur in the kingdoms of Rhudaur and Cardolan. The Prince of Cardolan, friendly to Argeleb, is likely to acknowledge this claim. But the Hillmen of Rhudaur, led foremost by Hwaldar, will likely fiercly resist the restoration of Dúnedain suzerainity over them. \n\nAnd to the north, a new fell power has been rising. Orcs, fell men, and other dark creatures gather beneath the banner of one only known as the 'Witch-King'..."

 bm_1349_gondor_desc: "In the reign of Atanatar II Alcarin, it was said that precious stones were in Gondor but pebbles for children to play with. Since those days, the long noontide of the south-realm has waxed, its strength and splendor growing day by day. It's navies dominate the coast as far south as the Bay of Tulwang, and to the north, it maintains a strong vigilance and allies in Rhovanion. The Kings of Harad bow their heads to the Winged Crown, and send their sons as captives to its court.\n\nThe power of Gondor now recalls the strength of Númenor of old ere it fell. But just as Númenor of old, power and wealth begets pride, and the Dúnedain of the south have grown most proud indeed - of both their kingdom and of their ancient heritage. And this pride may yet be their downfall..."

 bookmark_angmar_romendacil_desc: "In truth, Rómendacil II has reigned far longer than he has sat the throne. Born Minalcar, he served as Regent of Gondor for both his uncle Narmacil I and his father Calmacil, where he proved himself an energetic, dynamic, and shrewd leader. After defeating a great Easterling force in T.A. 1248 and claiming the name of Rómendacil, he led Gondorian focus and diplomacy in a completely new direction. He courted the northmen of Rhovanion and established a powerful network of allies, clients, and subjects in Gondor's northern frontier, securing the north as the Ship-Kings once had the south. He fortified the Anduin and erected the mighty Argonath statues.\n\nNow in the twilight of his reign, Rómendacil II stands triumphant as one of the greatest Gondorian kings and statemen, with a legacy few can rival. Yet his policies towards the north may yet be the seeds of a great calamity, though he does not realize it.."
