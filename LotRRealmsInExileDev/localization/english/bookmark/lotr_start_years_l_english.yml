His fortress of Barad-Dur has been fully rebuilt and Mount Doom has reawakened. Despite the recent victory in the Battle of Five Armies, the Free Peoples of Middle Earth lie more divided than ever before. After many centuries of decline and infighting, the Realm of Gondor is now the only remaining defense against this looming threat. However hope may yet still arise with the long-awaited Return of the King."
