Shall he lead Middle-earth into a new order, or will he become a footnote in the great story of this age? \n\nIn golden Meduseld, Théoden King, lord of the Riddermark, sits upon the throne of his forefathers, and he seems to the world whole and hale. But a shadow is upon the king, awaiting its hour, and the borders of his kingdom are pressed by foes unexpected. Shall the Rohirrim rise to meet the great challenge of the age, and blow their horns in defiance at the coming darkness? \n\n#TOLKIENQUOTE: “Who shall gather the smoke of the dead wood burning, or behold the flowing years from the Sea returning?”#!"

 bookmark_wotr_saruman_desc:0 "Saruman is an emissary of the Valar to Middle-earth; he is great among the Wise, chief of the order of the Istari and head of the White Council.\n\nA greater length of his time in Middle-earth has been in the east, traveling the lands of Rhûn, and beyond, even to Mordor whilst Gondor kept watch over it. In 2463 T3A, the White Council was formed in response to the growing threat of Sauron’s return. He spent years in Minas Tirith, Gondor, studying in its libraries and examining its ancient archives before offering his service to the Steward of Minas Tirith as keeper of Isengard.\n\nIn secret, Saruman seeks the One Ring, and starts the new millennium with a choice before him."
 # NOTE Alternative text: "Saruman came to Middle-earth two thousand years ago as a servant of the Valar and sent alongside other Maiar known as the Istari. He has been growing in power and is now corrupted by ambition, jealousy and pride.\n\nResiding in Orthanc, Saruman has long searched for the One Ring as he hopes to make its power his own. And by communicating with Sauron through the palantír he has truly fallen into shadow. Now a servant of darkness, Saruman has bought the loyalty of King Théoden’s advisor Gríma, who he hopes shall help him weaken Rohan." - edited from Julius Caesar.

Here the hammer stroke will fall hardest.”#!\n#QUOTEDCHARACTER: Gandalf the Grey.#!\n\nSauron prepares to crush the last great bulwark of the West, the Kingdom of Gondor. His armies are marshalled, his full strength almost gathered. He needs only the One Ring now to make his victory absolute and assure the fall of Gondor.\n\nIn Gondor, the Steward Denethor secludes himself in the White Tower, preparing his realm for the Great Battle to come. His sons wage war in Osgiliath and Ithilien to turn back the tide, and the men of Gondor fight on, defiant to the last.\n\nTo the south, Gondor's old foes in Haradwaith and Umbar are recovering from previous defeats. Nursing a grudge, they look on Gondor's strength, stretched thin, and see an opportunity to finally even the score. \n\nAgainst the threats arrayed against them, can the last kingdom of the Dúnedain hold?"

For years now, he has parried every thrust made by Mordor, and under his steely leadership Gondor has held the line against increasingly impossible odds. In any lesser kingdom, such a man would have long ago rightfully named himself King, but Denethor is no lesser man. Steward he is, and Gondor his charge. \n\nSecluded in the White Tower, the Steward of Gondor prepares the defence of his realm. But despair lurks in the shadows, biding its time."

Once, the Haruze kings held all of Haradwaith under their sway, and challenged Gondor itself for rule over Harondor. \n\nBut those days are past. The Chelkar revolt shattered whatever sembelance of unity the Haradrim had, and bit by bit, the empire of Haradwaith crumbled. Suladân looks to reverse this trend, and to restore his family to their rightful spot of pre-eminence in Harad. \n\nA power to the North is rising, one which shares Suladân's hatred of Gondor and Chelkar, and might prove decisive in realizing his ambitions."
