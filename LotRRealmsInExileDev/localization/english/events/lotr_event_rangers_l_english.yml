 rangers.0100.t:0 "The Chieftain of the Dúnedain"
 rangers.0100.desc:0 "Aragorn II, the 16th chieftain of the Dúnedain of Arnor, is a man marked by fate. Tall, regal in bearing, wise, kind, and skilled with arms, he is the image of the strength and nobility borne by the men of Númenor before its fall. When he was 2, his father Arathorn died to orcs, and he was spirited by his mother Gilraen to Rivendell, where he was raised by Lord Elrond Peredhel as his foster-son. \n\nWhen he was 20, he fell in love with Arwen Undómiel, and desired to marry her. She too loved him, but Elrond set before Aragorn a requirement. He would only give his blessing for his daughter to marry Aragorn if he became the High-King of Arnor and Gondor. Only then could he head west, assured of her safety and happiness. \n\nAragorn set out into the world, to toil in the name of the Free Peoples. In the south he served both Steward Ecthelion II of Gondor and King Thengel of Rohan, earning many honours and distinctions. But soon the hour of destiny will be upon Aragorn, and the blade that was broken shall be renewed. Time shall tell if Aragorn achieves all he has hoped, or if the Heir of Isildur is doomed to share the fate of his forefathers."

 rangers.0200.t:0 "The Passing of Gilraen"
 rangers.0200.desc:0 "On one of his trips in the North, Aragorn visited with his mother Gilraen in autumn. After spending a few days together, he prepared to leave out on his next journey, when his mother came to speak with him. \n\n"This is our last parting, Estel, my son. I am aged by care, even as one of lesser Men; and now that it draws near, I cannot face the darkness of our time that gathers upon Middle-earth. I shall leave it soon." \n\nAragorn tried to comfort her, saying: "Yet there may be a light beyond the darkness; and if so, I would have you see it and be glad." \n\nBut she answered only with this linnod: Ónen i-Estel Edain, ú-chebin estel anim; "I gave Hope to the Dúnedain, I have kept no hope for myself." \n\nHeavy in his heart, Aragorn went away to his tasks and toil. Gilraen died before the next spring."
