 dunedain.0100.desc:0 "Ever since the fall of Fornost and the death of Arvedui the Rangers of the North have kept a vigilant watch over the wilds of once great Arnor. We are a once proud people, made secretive and nomadic for the sake of our survival, for so long as the heir of Isildur lives, there is yet hope for the Dúnedain. \n\nElegost, son of Halbaron, brother of Halbarad and kin of the Chieftain Aragorn, you have wandered far south across the mighty Gwathlo - too far south, some say. Yet, in the lands of Dunland you see a people divided; a people long deceived by the whims and wiles of darkness. Can they be saved and united? Only your coming actions will decide."
 dunedain.0100.a:0 "We shall venture into the wilds."
 dunedain.0100.a.tt:0 "You will begin your conquest." 
 dunedain.0100.b:0 "We should return north."
 dunedain.0100.b.tt:0 "Your land will be forfeit."
