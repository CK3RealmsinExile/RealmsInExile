 ### Ar-Adunaim ###
 umbar.0100.t:0 "The Exiles of Ar-Adûnâim"
 umbar.0100.desc:0 "On a lonely archipelago in the sea of Belegaer is the self-proclaimed Ar-Adûnâim. Those who visit it may find two different experiences. Those who bear the blood of Númenor find a welcoming group which carries itself with dignity and honour. Those that do not, however, find themselves abused and spat upon, detested and treated like nothing more than feral dogs. Such is the nature of this exiled group of blood purists, cast out from the Haven of Umbar for their radical views. \n\nArising shortly after the arrival of Castimir the Usurper in Umbar, for years the blood-purists were merely another faction within Umbar - in fact, there is still a strong one in Umbar even after their departure. But the Ar-Adûnâim began to agitate for a great 'cleansing' of the Havens, which would bring about a restoration of Númenórean purity and be the herald of a glorious reclamation of their long-lost empire. Pragmatists in Umbar ultimately were forced to act when a rally transformed into a lynch mob that resulted in a fire which devastated a large section of the port. \n\nSince then, the Ar-Adûnâim have stewed on their rocks in the sea, awaiting the beginning of their great crusade. Their leader, Gimilkhâd, claims to have spoken with his august ancestor Ar-Pharazôn through the mediation of the Great Lord, Mulkhêr. If they keep the faith, and offer sacrifices in his name, then the Great Lord shall bring forth the Great Armament, and the armies of Anadûnê shall once more roll over the land."
 umbar.0100.a:0 "The Reclamation is coming. Anadûnê shall rise again!"
 umbar.0100.a.tt:0 "From this searock fortress we will reclaim the legacy of Númenor."

 ### Umbar ###
 umbar.0200.t:0 "The Heir of Castamir"
 umbar.0200.desc:0 "Since the days of the Kin-Strife, Umbar has been the refuge of the blood of Castamir, rightful king of Gondor. However, Umbar has been too disunified to truly pose any threat to Gondor. \n\nRoughly 30 years ago, the previous King of Umbar, Azûlzîr, began to test Gondor's defences. Gondor was not caught unaware, however, and slipping through the defences of Umbar by night, the daring captain Thorongil set the port - and the fleet - ablaze. Azûlzîr met him in personal combat as Thorongil covered his men's retreat, but Thorongil was the mightier, and slew him. \n\nThus did Kathuphazgân become lord in Umbar, but he inherited not a mighty realm, a dread across all the shores of Gondor, but one in freefall. The hinterlands, never truly brought to heel and colonized, swiftly broke away, and blood purists in Umbar started a riot which further damaged the port, leading to their exile. After many years of careful stewardship, Kathuphazgân has led Umbar back to a semblance of order, with honeyed words and judicious application of force. But he desires greater honour and glory, and to at last place his family upon the Gondorian throne. His sons are full grown and powerful men, yet there are concerns of a growing rivalry between the two concerning the succession..."
 umbar.0200.a:0 "But first, the hinterlands must be brought to heel."
 umbar.0200.a.tt:0 "Some of the legates of the hinterlands will accept your overlordship by careful diplomacy, but others shall need force."
 
 umbar.1000.t:0 "The Castmiri Claim"
 umbar.1000.desc:0 "Since the days of the Kin-Strife, Castamir's descendants have been forced to cower in Umbar, denied their rightful birthright by bitter nobles and jealous stewards. No longer! We shall have our birthright."
 umbar.1000.a:0 "Our day has come! We sail for Gondor!"
 umbar.1000.a.tt:0 "Glory or defeat, it shall be decided today."
 
 umbar.1001.t:0 "The Reigns of Castamir"
 umbar.1001.desc:0 "After a long and brutal campaign, Gondor at last kneels before her rightful king once more. The stewards have been stripped of their office, and the lords brought to heel. Once more the line of Castamir rules fair Gondor. But the time has come to make a choice. In our years in exile, we came to name ourselves lord of Anadûnê. A prestigious name, but not the one we have so long staked a claim to. Shall we reclaim the title of King of Gondor, or shall we remain the King of Anadûnê?"
 umbar.1001.a:0 "Gondor has always been our true home."
 umbar.1001.b:0 "Gondor shall become part of something greater."
 
 umbar.1002.t:0 "An Invasion from the South!"
 umbar.1002.desc:0 "Reports have come of a great fleet off the coasts of Harondor. The lord of Anadûnê, descendant of the accursed Castamir the Usurper, has declared his intent to retake his ancestral throne, by force if necessary. The coastal lords are already rallying their forces, and the Sealord of Pelargir has ordered the fleet massed there. \n\nWhatever right Castamir and his kin ever had to the throne of Gondor was rendered null and void, by right of his tyranny and treason against the rightful king. We cannot allow his descendants to claim something unrightfully theirs!"
 umbar.1002.a:0 "We shall cast this foul usurper back into the Sea, and Gondor will not forget this..."
 
 umbar.0001.t:0 "Unrest in Western Gondor"
 umbar.0001.desc:0 "My lord, there is news of great unrest in the western frontier of Gondor. Perhaps this is an opportunity? These Wildmen factions are more than eager to raid and harass Gondor's western borders. If we were to fund one of these groups, they could prove valuable to our future places of reclamation."
 umbar.0001.a:0 "We shall fund these Wildmen."
 umbar.0001.at:0 "A new decision to fund a Wildmen invasion of Gondor becomes available."
 umbar.0001.b:0 "We don't require the aid of savages to take back what is ours!"

 umbar.0002.t:0 "Unrest in Western Gondor"
 umbar.0002.desc:0 "The Wildmen have accepted our offer and an invasion into Gondor has been launched! We shall have to make certain to watch any further developments closely..."
 umbar.0002.a:0 "Good, Gondor's loss is our gain."

 umbar.0003.t:0 "Unrest in Western Gondor"
 umbar.0003.desc:0 "The Wildmen have declined our offer; no invasion shall be launched. Thankfully, the brutes were honourable enough to return the funds we had given them."
 umbar.0003.a:0 "A pity, they seemed capable enough."

 umbar.0004.t:0 "Unrest in Western Gondor"
 umbar.0004.desc:0 "The Wildmen have declined our offer; no invasion will be launched. To add insult to injury, the scoundrels have seemingly decided to keep our funds for themselves!"
 umbar.0004.a:0 "How dare they!"
 
 umbar.1003.t:0 "A New Capital?"
 umbar.1003.desc:0 "Now that the realm of Gondor has finally been unified under its rightful King, the question remains, from where shall we rule our great Kingdom. Some voices are calling for us to take the old seat of Gondor and rule the Kingdom from there. Meanwhile others want us to retain our ancient seat of Umbar. Finally, some remember the reign of King Castamir I of Gondor and want us to make Pelargir our capital due to its historical importance and strategic positioning in between the two halves of our realm."
 umbar.1003.a:0 "Minas Tirith shall be our capital."
 umbar.1003.b:0 "Restored Osgiliath shall be our seat."
 umbar.1003.c:0 "We shall honour Castamir and make Pelargir the capital."
 umbar.1003.d:0 "Umbar is and shall remain the core of our Kingdom."
