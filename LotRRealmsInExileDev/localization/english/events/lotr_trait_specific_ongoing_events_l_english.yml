 trait_specific_ongoing.1014.desc:0 "In the middle of the night, thunder rends the sky outside your window, the crashing waves making the whole world tremble. A pungent smell of brine fills your nostrils. Was the sea ever this close to your halls? It seems to be closing all around you, as if devouring the very foundations of the earth that would have otherwise separated you from the great blue. \n\nAs you listen to the raging waters, a fear strikes into your heart. Could it be that the sea had come to finish the work it started in old Anadûnê? Your hands tremble as the crashes grow ever louder in your head. \n\nIt's here. The sea has come once again to put an end to the ragged descendants of Anadûnê."

 trait_specific_ongoing.1014.c:0 "No... It can't be. No one must know, I must keep this information to myself."
