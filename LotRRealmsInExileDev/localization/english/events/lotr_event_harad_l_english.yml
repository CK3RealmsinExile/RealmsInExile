 ### Chelkari Events ###
 harad.0100.t:0 "The Chelkar Revolt"
 harad.0100.desc:0 "Five generations of men ago, Khadnom, a zealous believer in the Gods, rallied the Chelkar people against the cruel Haruze kings and their cult of the vile serpent. From that revolt was reborn the ancient kingdom of Chelkar, a mighty trading state which sat at the crossroads of ancient empires and grew fabulously rich from it. \n\nHis son, Safal the Stalwart, repulsed 3 attempts by the Haruze kings to reconquer what they had lost, dealing a deathblow to their waning power. But his son, Sagalion, proved less capable on all fronts, and was weak and an ineffectual leader. He was ultimately assassinated, with the prime suspect the resurgent Haruze kingdom under Sûladan. Perhaps he hoped to weaken the Chelkar by placing them under the rule of a young child. \n\nBut if that was the intent, a miscalculation was made, for Kalafar is a man of the make of his grandfather - a strong warrior, zealous in his faith to the old ways. His brother Sinil has also risen to the challenge and now serves his brother as a legal lord, despite offers from Haruzan to elevate him to the title of viceroy if he would betray Kalafar. \n\nNow, Chelkar again raises its fence of swords in defiance against a world that once more seeks to extinguish them. Serpents coil to the west, and to the north, dark winds come down from the mountains, seeking to secure its southern flank..."
 harad.0100.a:0 "We shall never kneel."
 harad.0100.a.tt:0 "A serpent to the west, and a shadow to the North. We must hold."

 harad.0101.t:0 "The Nâdi-manyê Faithful of Pezarsan"
 harad.0101.desc:0 "Grim tidings have come from the south, and so Kalafar is facing the first true crisis of his reign. The small remaining Nâdi-manyê community in Pezarsan, located in the villages straddling the tentative and porous border, had come under intense persecution. His southern vassal, Emir Medja, took the initiative in response to the perceived atrocity. His militias rolled over the border, and before Kalafar knew it, he had a choice to make. Reign in his vassal, and abandon the faithful, or cast his full weight behind the intervention.\n\nKalafar, descendant of the father of the Great Revolt, had no real choice at all. The faithful could not be abandoned. Additionally, this was a chance to further secure his own homeland by pushing back the encircling serpents. To Pezarsan he would go."
 harad.0101.a:0 "The encircling serpent shall have its neck cut off."

 ### Haruze Events ###
 harad.0200.t:0 "Sûladan's Ambitions"
 harad.0200.desc:0 "150 years ago, the great dominion of the Haruze kings was shattered. The Chelkar Revolt destroyed any semblance of unity the kingdom had, and Amrûn was sacked. Bit by bit, the Haruze Kingdom crumbled, the border regions breaking off into warlords. Now, the Kingdom of Haruzan is a sad remnant of its former glory. But Sûladan seeks to change that. \n\nBorn at the end of his father's life as an only son, Sûladan possesses a great fire in his heart. While he could do little while in his minority, with regents controlling affairs of state, he spent his youth dreaming grand visions of a restored Haradwaith. Now, in the fullness of his rule, Sûladan finds a world in chaos, his house's old foes weak and hobbled. \n\nThe rebel-king in Chelkar suffered an unfortunate accident, leaving the region under the control of a boy-king. Meanwhile, his cousin Balkuthôr desires to push his claim to lands in Pezarsan, promising to swear allegiance to Sûladan in exchange for his aid. And to the north, the Serpent-King Khäz-gramaze readies to finally annihilate the hated Sea-peoples. \n\nHaruzan's hour is nigh, if Sûladan has but the strength to grasp it."
 harad.0200.a:0 "To Pezarsan - the reunification starts there!"

 harad.0201.t:0 "The Heir to Pezarsan?"
 harad.0201.desc:0 "Born in a small domain, to a minor branch of the once-great house Ayerikkä, Balkuthôr’s future seemed fairly set in stone. He would rule his small domain from Tir Argorn, never having the opportunity to participate in the Great Game, no matter how deeply he desired a chance to rise.\n\nBut so often does fate turn on the smallest of events, and opportunity arises unlooked for. One afternoon, Balkuthôr’s mighty cousin, Sûladan, king and lord of all Haruze, came to visit, riding into his humble domain on the back of a great Mûmakil. After the pleasantries were concluded,  the King bid his cousin to speak with him in private. Intrigued, Balkuthôr agreed.\n\nSecluded in his private chambers, Sûladan spoke impassionately of their family’s lost glories, and how he desired to reclaim their lapsed provinces – Pezarsan and Chelkar most of all. And that, he said, is why he had come. For Sûladan knew the lineage of Balkuthôr’s mother, sister to the last king of Pezarsan. The new king, Dasin II was sadistic and cruel, and he had heard rumblings of his people's desire for a new lord. It seemed Khäz-gramaze had at last heard his family’s pious prayers. And here he made his offer – should Balkuthôr acknowledge his cousin’s supremacy as head of the family, and, at least in name, king of Pezarsan, then Sûladan would do everything in his power to see him seated as lord of Pezarsan.\n\nIt is a generous offer, and a chance to rise in the world Balkuthôr had not expected to have. Is it any wonder he said yes?"
 harad.0201.a:0 "The people of Pezarsan will prosper under my rule!"

 harad.0202.t:0 "The Fate of the Kingdom of Pezarsan"
 harad.0202.desc:0 "It was a hard-fought campaign, but at long last House Ayerikkä stands triumphant as the rightful masters of Pezarsan. The Southern Chieftains have acknowledged you as the rightful king of Pezarsan and shall fight for you as they once did Dasin, swearing their blood-oaths anew. The time has come for you to honour your pledge to your cousin.\n\nWith your promise fulfilled you would be Lord of Pezarsan and vassal, king in all but name, the second highest lord in the Kingdom of Haruzan with the close confidence of your cousin.\n\nBut a thought enters into your head. Why should you now bend the knee to your cousin? You fought at the head of the armies to secure Pezarsan, while Sûladan managed the logistics at the rear. It was you who the people of Pezarsan had come to know, and who greeted you in so kingly a manner, as befits a liberator. But do you dare to risk the consequences of such a betrayal?"
 harad.0202.a:0 "I gave my word. My cousin’s dreams shall be realized. One House, One Haradwaith!"
 harad.0202.b:0 "I am king of Pezarsan now – why should I grovel at the feet of my cousin?"

 harad.0203.t:0 "Broken Dreams"
 harad.0203.desc:0 "It is a bitter pill, but all of your grand visions of sitting upon the throne of Pezarsan have come to naught. Your troops are bloodied and battered; they have been forced back into the core of Haruzan by your foes. There is no more hope of achieving victory upon the field of battle this day.\n\nThe King of Haruzan, silently stewing as you return, swears he will not forget your support for his plans, and that he shall protect you from any possible reprisal from foes abroad. It is time, he claims, for all our house to be once more united under one roof, and bids you ride with him to Amrûn. There will you speak oaths of lord and vassal, so none might question his protection.\n\nRethinking your grand dreams and ambitions after being so thoroughly humbled, you agree without a fight. Perhaps a quiet life as a servant to your cousin is your true calling."
 harad.0203.a:0 "One House, One Haruzan."

 ### Pezarsani Events ###
 harad.0300.t:0 "The Succession of Pezarsan"
 harad.0300.desc:0 "Dasin II had barely sat upon his regal throne before news arrived of foreign incursions. From the West, the fading Ayerikkä dynasty is trying to push a claim upon his lands through his cousin – to the North, the damnable Chelkar under Kalafar are pushing into his lands on pretexts of protecting the Nâdi-manyê faithful in his northern border-regions. Dasin sees them for who they are. Vultures and cravens the lot, desiring simply to steal his rightful place!\n\nSummoning his tributaries and allies from the south, Chieftains Uregh and Maysar, Dasin II plans the defense of his domain. His southern allies have sworn a blood oath to him – to defend to the end the rightful king of Pezarsan. He shall fear no force from the south if nothing else.\n\nBut against two enemies, who does he fight first?"
 harad.0300.a:0 "Damn those northern zealots! They shall fall first!"
 harad.0300.b:0 "Vulture-Snakes! I’ll flay the Ayerikkä for this!"
 
 
 ### Mûmak at Large ###

 harad.0014.desc:0 "A messenger bursts into your hall bearing urgent news about a Mûmak rampaging through the countryside. The beast leaves a trail of destruction in its wake, no fence nor wall able to contain its stampeding feet.\n\nMany peasants have tried to restrain it but have lost their lives in the process. A larger force might be needed to see that the mûmak is controlled before it causes even more damage."
 harad.0014.a:0 "Leave it be. Who are we to stand against such a force of nature?"
