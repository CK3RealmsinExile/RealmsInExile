 ### RHÛN FLAVOUR ###
 rhun.0010.t:0 "The Logath"
 rhun.0010.desc:0 "Since before the days of the Cruel Ones’ defeat at Dagorlad, we have ridden free in the wild, wooded vales of our northern home beneath the Iron hills, a hundred families of the entwined Logath, far away from the Dark Lands. The tapestry of our life has remained continuous through the long years, our mothers shepherd, our daughters trade.\n\nTo our south, the neighbouring Dorwinrim keep watch at the fords of the Carnen, the river of wine. In the Iron Hills are dwarves, making hard negotiations with our river clans for passage through to the markets of Dorwinion and Dale."
 # Vector "Since before the days of the Cruel Ones, we have lived in these lands. Our kin to the south have grown prosperous and fat, but for us life has remained much as it ever was - the mother lead and guide the sheep, the daughters trade, father and sons keep the hearth and the home. Such it has ever been, thus it shall continue to be. The Dwarves of the Iron Hills drive a hard bargain in order to use our rivers for trade, but from it we derive a simple, but secure, life.\n\nYet there is also word from our clanskin to the south - rumors of war, and of strife, perhaps even the Cruel Ones of old returning. Long has it been since our warriors marched to true war, but perhaps it is time..."

 rhun.0011.desc:0 "Silently and listening we watch as the women of Dale build new lives for their families as they settle ever closer to our herd-lands. Merchants bring fine materials and jewels and news. We listen to the whispers of merchants, concerning the safety of home, of returning to their wives: there is trouble abroad."
 # Vector "For years now we have watched the women of Dale come to our lands, increasingly bespeckled with jewels and finery to trade, and some have even stayed in the west of our herd-lands, bringing with them their clans. This has brought us much trade, and new items which we previously only could procure through our clanskin to the south - but many of the more hotheaded young women grouse at these strange foreigners, particularly men, laying claim to what have always been our own herd-lands, swearing fealty to a man-chieftain far off. \n\nThe matriarchs thus far have dampened such angry talk, but perhaps if support was rallied..."
 rhun.0011.a:0 "The courtly women of Dale trade items of great beauty."
 rhun.0011.b:0 "Our herd-lands are our tapistry. Keep them safe."
