 decision_lotr_warbands_desc_parth_celebrant_leofring:0 "Despite settling between and so close to the perilous forests of Dwimordene and Fangorn your people have endured. Your rituals and sacrifices of food and drink must be appeasing the elvish wights of the golden wood."
 decision_lotr_warbands_desc_dwarrowhall_leofring:0 "After a perilous migration to lands south of the Grey Mountains our people found refuge in an abandoned mine outside of Moria. It provided shelter and warmth from the bitter winds and now your people will survive."
 decision_lotr_warbands_desc_bandit_leofring:0 "Roving bands of Orcs drove your people out of the north. Scores of your people have taken the life of banditry, raiding the Rohirrim across the Anduin."
 decision_lotr_warbands_desc_eotheod:0 "The Éothéod must assemble the cavalry and make ready for war. Stride forth Horse Lords!"
 decision_lotr_warbands_desc_hill_dunlending:0 "The Rohirrim stole your land eons ago, but your people have rebuilt their lives in Dunland. Yet there is a power at work here, inciting warriors to take revenge of that old wound."

 decision_lotr_warbands_desc_gondor_gwathuirim:0 "The kinfolk of the ancient house of Haleth inhabited the White Mountains and all the lands to the sea. Yet when Númenórean colonists arrived from beyond the great sea, your lives were shattered as they refused to recognise you as people just like them, as one of the houses of the Edain.\n\nRespecting not your sacred heritage as a forest people, the colonial outsiders devastated the ancient woods of Gondor and the Enedhwaith. And for refusing to fight in their wars against the Dark Lord they cursed you."
 decision_lotr_warbands_desc_haradrim:0 "The Haradrim people are numerous, diverse, thriving; they live in great cities alongside the Harnen river, also in bellicose tribes, dominating the endless sands, some reside in fortresses from which they raid all coasts.

 decision_lotr_warbands_desc_haradrim_desert:0 "The Haradrim people are numerous, diverse, thriving; they live in great cities alongside the Harnen river, also in bellicose tribes, dominating the endless sands, some reside in fortresses from which they raid all coasts. These settled and tribal men and women alike, mingle under the sun in the bazaars of Middle-earth.\n\nYou are of those Haradrim who track the sea of dunes, always ready for war, patient for an opening."
