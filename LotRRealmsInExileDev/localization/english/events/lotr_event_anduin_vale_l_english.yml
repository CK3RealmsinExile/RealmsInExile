 ### Beorning Events ###

 anduin_vale.0100.t:0 "The Beornings"
 anduin_vale.0100.desc:0 "In the aftermath of the Battle of Five Armies, the mysterious skinchanger Beorn reluctantly accepted the mantle of leadership over many tribes of the Anduin Vale and western Mirkwood, taking to wife Medulynn, the daughter of the chieftain of the Olphanging tribe. \n\nHis son Grimbeorn, of like mind and stature to his father, now rules over a wide realm between the mountains and the deep forest. The 'Beornings', as they are known, keep open the High Pass, the Ford of Carrock, and the western stretches of the Old Forest Road (or 'Viduweg', as the woodmen name it), keeping the mountain goblins at bay. \n\nYet to the south, an evil has returned to the cursed fortress of Dol Guldur. And to the north, rumours come of renewed raids by the goblins of Gundabad. In these darkening days, will the Beornings keep the fractious tribes united and resist the machinations of their foes? Or will they be swept aside before the rising tide, like so many of the petty realms that preceded them, with the legacy of Beorn forgotten forever?"
 anduin_vale.0100.a:0 "United, the wood and vale will stand!"
 anduin_vale.0100.a.tt:0 "A true bear cannot rest at ease"

 anduin_vale.0102.t:0 "The Realm of the All-Thane"
 anduin_vale.0102.desc:0 "For time out of mind, the Woodmen and their brethren in the Vale have remained fiercely independent, both from outsiders and from each other. Only in the direst of need have the fractious tribes elected a single ruler, the All-Thane or 'Aledegan', to unite their efforts against a common enemy. \n\nBut times have changed. Under your dynasty a great realm has been forged, uniting both the Anduin Vale and the traditional lands of the Woodmen in the great forest of Greenwood. The disparate folk of Wood and Vale have all acknowledged your leadership, and the right of your heirs to rule in perpetuity. Never again will your people be divided, to fall prey to predatory orcs, wargs and worse. You have created the Realm of the All-Thane - the Aladagana!"
 anduin_vale.0102.a:0 "And I am the Aladegan!"
 anduin_vale.0102.a.tt:0 "You have created the empire title of Aladegana"

 ### Framling Events ###

 anduin_vale.0103.t:0 "The Framlings"
 anduin_vale.0103.desc:0 "The Framlings are possessed of pride and long memories. But pride does not fill a belly, nor memory defend against a cruel blade. They have long been a dwindling people, haunted by grief at their abandonment by their kin. \n\nIn their own tongue they label themselves the Éowealafa - “The horses left behind”. Left behind by Eorl, who took the greater part of the Éothéod south to win great renown. Left behind by Leof, who led many of  those who remained to a less honourable fate. Yet a remnant of the Éothéod still eke out an existence in the foothills of the Grey Mountains, clinging to their horses and their traditions. \n\nErwigiar Alarichosson, descendant of Fram, finds himself a king on a precipice. Will his people fall to the resurgent goblins of the mountains, or be swept aside by the primitives woodmen who have usurped the Vale where his ancestors once rode? Or will he and his descendants prove themselves worthy of their forefathers, conquer the lands between mountain and wood, and claim their birthright as the true heirs of the Éothéod?"
 anduin_vale.0103.a:0 "Forth Framlingas!"
 anduin_vale.0103.a.tt:0 "The fate of the Framlings is in your hands."

 anduin_vale.0106.t:0 "The Kingdom of the Éothéod Restored!"
 anduin_vale.0106.desc:0 "For long years your people have been but a shadow of their former might, living hidden lives in the folds below the Grey Mountains. With the departures of Eorl and Leof with the greater part of the Éothéod the dwindling remnant were too weak to assert their claim to the Vale, and pressure from Goblin raids and Woodmen usurpers long prevented any hope of a resurgence. \n\nYet under your leadership the Framlings have rallied, and once again the northern Vale is dominated by the true sons of Fram. The legitimacy of your line has been proven at the point of a sword, and the Kingdom of the Éothéod is resurgent astride the roots of the Great River. \n\nAmong the bolder and more ambitious of your folk there are even rumblings that the renewed northern line of Fram should assert itself over your Rohirric cousins to the south..."
 anduin_vale.0106.a:0 "The Realm of the Riders is Restored!"
 anduin_vale.0106.a.tt:0 "You have recreated the kingdom of the Éothéod"

 ### Valemen Starting Events ###

 anduin_vale.0104.t:0 "The Melburgi"
 anduin_vale.0104.desc:0 "The Melburgi live in the wooded northeastern foothills of the Misty Mountains, close to Goblin-gate and Eagle's Eyrie, and are named after their main settlement, the relatively civilised and prosperous market-town of Melburg (anciently ‘Mathlaisburg’). This town and its stout stone walls were founded in centuries past, and its fortunes have waxed and waned, sometimes being abandoned entirely. Yet its strategic location always led to it being re-established in times of relative peace, most recently after the White Council’s assault on Dol Guldur. \n\nMost of the Melburgi tribe have sworn to the Beornings, but some of the more impetuous and independent of mind were led north by Thegn Egica to colonise lands traditionally claimed by the Framling horselords. Egica was soon slain in a Framling raid, but his son Egico has consolidated control, retaining independence from his cousins in Melburg, the spreading Beorning hegemony, and the Éothéod remnant alike.\n\nBut the winds of change are blowing. Rumours reach Egico’s ears of goblins stirring again in the mountains, gathering horsemen in the north, and the growing ambitions of Grimbeorn. What path will Egico take in defence of his people? Will he bow to his neighbours, or rise to become paramount among both his own tribe and the other men of the Vale?  "
 anduin_vale.0104.a:0 "Stone walls and hard hearts!"
 anduin_vale.0104.a.tt:0 "The future is in your hands.."

 anduin_vale.0105.t:0 "The Herimundi"
 anduin_vale.0105.desc:0 "The Herimundi were among the first woodmen to migrate into the Vale, settling in the ‘Warnelanth’ area west of Dol Guldur. They have gradually expanded their lands, consolidating control on both sides of the river and regularly raiding the fractious Leofrings to the south.  \n\nHowever, in recent years they have become a tribe divided. The twin sons of their last chieftain, Miron, competed for the affections of Grimbeorn’s daughter. The brother that eventually won her troth, Madrubal, took his share of tribal lands into the Beorning confederation. His brother and bitter rival, Mauregato, continues to eke out an independent existence to the south, plotting revenge on his brother and the Beornings. These divisions threaten to play into the hands of the rising power in Dol Guldur. \n\nWill Mauregoto fall prey to his stronger neighbours? Or will he regain his dignity, reunite Herimundi lands, and humiliate the hirsute usurpers to the north?"
 anduin_vale.0105.a:0 "We are the most valorous of the Vale!"
 anduin_vale.0105.a.tt:0 "Seek revenge on your brother and reunite the Herimundi."
