 news_event.0001.t:0 "The Tedjin Civil War"
 news_event.0001.desc:0 "The Tedjin Confederacy is roiling with unrest, as the ambitious new Kataj Bór seeks to push forward political and religious reforms. In response, the more conservative lords of the confederacy have begun to covertly resist Bór's efforts at every turn.\n\nWhile we might quickly dismiss the internal squabbles of desert tribesmen, the Tedjin are renowned fighters and mercenaries, and occupy a vital buffer between Umbar and Bellakar. Should the reactionary lords succeed in overthrowing Bór, their ambitions will surely turn South once more.\n\nFinally, the crisis in the Confederacy has finally reached breaking point. Formal demands for the Reformist Kataj to abdicate sent by the Reactionary Faction have been outright rejected and the two sides are now in open war.\n\nTime is fast running out for interested parties to make their interventions as the future of the Confederacy hangs in the balance."

 news_event.0002.desc:0 "The [tedjinfounder.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip] forces under [tedjinfounder.GetUIName] have seized large parts of the western coastline in a realm stretching from the Harnen to the Bay of Felaya.\n\nThese zealous new converts to the faith of the One have taken it upon themselves to forge a new home for themselves in the ancient cities of the corsairs of Mardrûak and Umbar.\n\nAnd still, their leaders have not forgotten the meddling of Haruzan in their affairs, and have long nursed a grudge. Perhaps from their new base of power they might attempt to even assault Amrûn itself."
 news_event.0002.a:0 "A triumph for the righteous!"
 news_event.0002.b:0 "Are they friend or foe?"
 news_event.0002.c:0 "If they desire the coast, we shall push them into the sea..."

 news_event.0003.desc:0 "In a decisive campaign, [tedjinfounder.GetUIName] has seized much of the Harnen, drawing close to both Gondor and Mordor.\n\nIn such a prime position they now have a strong hold on the north-south trade over both land and sea, and are sure to prosper from it.\n\nTime will tell if they shall continue their meteoric rise, or fall from having flown too close to Arien."

 news_event.0004.t:0 "Qadjajar Rises Anew"
 news_event.0004.desc:0 "In a shocking turn, the fearsome Tedjin empire of Qadjajar has been resurrected by [tedjinfounder.GetUIName]. Qadjajar once controlled all of Bellakar, but its heartland was always the northern provinces of Bellakar, Mardrûak and Felaya, and this was what the Tedjin referred to when using the name.\n\nNow, with a brutal conquest of Mardrûak and Felaya, the Tedjin have finally rebuilt the state that so long ago crumbled and the ancient palaces of Joam have been proclaimed as the capital of this restored state.\n\nWill the ambitious [tedjinfounder.GetUIName] next attempt to restore the maximum extent of Qadjajar, and also conquer southern Bellakar?"
 news_event.0004.a:0 "A nightmare of ages past..."
 news_event.0004.b:0 "Qadjajar rises once more."

 news_event.0005.t:0 "The Might of Qadjajar"
 news_event.0005.desc:0 "In a swift campaign, the Tedjin of Qadjajar have recreated the feats of their fell forefathers, and have crushed Bellakar underfoot. The last dynasts of Bellakar have either fled into exile or have been slaughtered, while feasts are held day and night in the Qadjajar capital of Joam.\n\nWith this final fall of Bellakar, the Tedjin have rebuilt and matched the apex of their power and might."

 news_event.0006.desc:0 "Despite lacking in number compared with [defender.GetHerHis] rebellious subjects [defender.GetTitledFirstName|U] has prevailed decisively. The rebellious lords have been humbled, sure to be either stripped of their lands, exiled, or executed.\n\nThe old ways are fast fading in the lands of the Tedjin, as [defender.GetTitledFirstName|U] intensifies [defender.GetHerHis] reforms, [defender.GetHerHis] gaze turns westward towards the coast..."
 news_event.0006.a:0 "Proof that a righteous cause will always prevail!"
 news_event.0006.b:0 "Interesting."
 news_event.0006.c:0 "How can you lose with such a numerical advantage?"

 news_event.0007.t:0 "Reactionary Victory in the Tedjin Civil War"
 news_event.0007.desc:0 "In the end, the numbers were too great - the reformist Kataj, [defender.GetFirstName|U], has been overthrown by [defender.GetHerHis] vassals and has fled into exile with [defender.GetHerHis] supporters.\n\nIn [defender.GetHerHis] place, [attacker.GetFirstName|U] has publicly stated [attacker.GetHerHis] intent to put an end to all malignant 'foreign' influences in [attacker.GetHerHis] realm, and to crush the very source of them - Felaya.\n\nThe Tedjin appear to be preparing for another attempt at conquering the lands they so long ago lost..."

 news_event.0007.b:0 "Interesting."
 news_event.0007.c:0 "May this be the start of a more brutal conquest."

 news_event.0008.t:0 "Rapprochement between Bellakar and Felaya"
 news_event.0008.desc:0 "While technically never independent from the Kingdom of Bellakar, in practical terms the region of Felaya has acted wholly autonomously since the reign of Aromôzîr I almost 1000 years ago. Periods of rapprochement and estrangement have waxed and waned between the province and the greater kingdom, as religiously it stood distinct from the southern heartlands of the kingdom, and its culture nurtured a burgeoning pride in their self-reliance. The First Lords have even warred with Bellakar in the past when they overstepped their bounds.\n\nNow at last relations appear to be on the permanent mend, as the First Lord of Felaya has officially traveled to Nilûlondê to pay homage and swear fealty to his overlord, something which has not been done since the days of King Mâsrakayân and Queen Zimrubêl.\n\nThis rapprochement appears to be largely due to [bellakarruler.GetTitledFirstName|U], whose careful diplomacy, overtures, and assurances to the people of Felaya as to their status within the greater kingdom has allowed the rift to be mended without a painful and bloody reconquest."
 news_event.0008.a:0 "We are all stronger united."
 news_event.0008.b:0 "Congratulations?"
 news_event.0008.c:0 "Together or divided, they will fall."

 news_event.0009.desc:0 "Unlooked for, unasked for, and shocking the entirety of the [bayoftulwang|E], the Honnin tribesman dwelling in the Sûza Sûmar have marched throughout the Rây, claiming cities and settling their people in small bands throughout the land.\n\nThe Honnin were the first men to dwell in the Rây, and built the first monolithic stone structures within the region. It was they who first taught the Apysaic Haradrim how to work stone and cultivate agriculture. However, as the Haradrim migrated into the fertile and lush valleys, a coexistence of teacher and student turned into a silent tug of war. The Honnin, unlovely to behold and slow to reproduce, were forced out by the ever multiplying Bôzishnarûd into the Sûza Sûmar, whence they lost much of their knowledge and teachings.\n\nNow though, this has changed. The Honnin, under the lead of [grab Honnin leader] have reclaimed their ancestral homeland, what they name the Sûzush Agkhôr. Already they are raising new great stone structures, and seem set with a grave determination to never again suffer the ruin they have now begun to recover from."
