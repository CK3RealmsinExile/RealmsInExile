Ever yet more forges, more barracks, more storehouses for plunder and goods, I ever desire to add more, to grow yet more! All of them interconnected, bound together into a seamless whole that churns forth men and materials with which I shall exert my will. Sauron's tower may reach higher than my own, but the foundations of my stronghold will stretch deeper than even the greatest stronghold of the Dwarves.\n\nSome of my servants worry over the recent losses in the depths, scouts and miners going missing down in the deep dark. But such losses are of small import for the greater good we are achieving here, the grand design which we are fulfilling."

 isengard.0237.desc:0 "It made itself known with a terrible screech which shook the entirety of Isengard. Even up on the surface it could be heard, and many cringed in terror at the mere sound of it. Yet I am no mere mortal, but the greatest of the Istari, one of the Wise!\n\nIn the depths I found it, tearing through my troops as if they were wet paper, many a forge already destroyed and bent asunder. It is a strange beast, and I am unable to make out the finer details. It seems to me a writhing shadow, full of anger, and lifting high my staff I let my voice ring out.\n\n#V "I am Saruman, the Lord of Isengard - this land is my dominion..."#!"

Everything is unmade, tunnels collapsing, your servants slaughtered, forges rent asunder and steel broken like trees in a storm. Only when it reaches the daylight does it finally relent, releasing a terrible keening cry, fleeing from the light into the black depths once more. In its wake, there is nothing but despair and loss.
