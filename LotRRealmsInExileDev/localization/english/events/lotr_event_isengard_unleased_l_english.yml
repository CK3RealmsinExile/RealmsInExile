 ### SARUMAN EVENTS ###
 saruman.0001.t:0 "The Lord of Isengard"
 saruman.0001.desc:0 "Isengard was not made by you, but by the Men of Númenor long ago; it is very tall and has many secrets; yet it looks not to be a work of craft.\n\nIt was at the crowning of Fréaláf King of the Riddermark, that you appeared, bringing gifts, and speaking great praise of the valour of the Rohirrim. All knew you a welcome guest. Soon after you took up your abode in Isengard, for Beren, the Steward of Minas Tirith, had gave you the keys to Orthanc; and from that year on 2759 TA you have dwelt in Isengard.\n\nYou became a lord of Men; for at first you held Isengard as a lieutenant of the Steward and warden of the tower. Fréaláf was as glad as Beren to have this so, and know that Isengard was in the hands of a strong friend. A friend you long were, and you kept the tower as part of the defences of the West, so long as you yourself remained the chief person in that defence, and the head of its council.\n\nYour subjects are mixed Rohirrim and Dunlending, and no longer do you consider the realm of Gondor as your liege."
 saruman.0001.a:0 "The rule of Isengard is now mine, as are its secrets."
 saruman.0001.a.tt:0 "You are no longer a vassal of the Lord of Minas Tirith."
 saruman.0001.a.tt2:0 "You have access to the Orthanc palantír, a seeing stone."
 saruman.0001.a.tt3:0 "You may use the palantír via an initial, major decision and continue to use it via a minor decision."
 saruman.0001.b:0 "I shall remain a vassal of the Lord Denethor of Minas Tirith."
 saruman.0001.b.tt:0 "You remain a vassal of the Lord of Minas Tirith."

 saruman.0002.t:0 "The Orthanc Stone"
 saruman.0002.desc:0 "In the middle of your throne-room is a black stand. On it, a black cloth covering the palantír, the greatest of the secrets of Isengard.\n\nGandalf would advise you to disregard its power. The grey fool miscalculates your wisdom and strength.\n\nSauron has a palantír: the captured Ithil Stone of Minas Ithil. That is guessed correctly by you. In the past you have felt his gaze on Isengard. But you are powerful enough to resist him, shrouding your valley in secrecy from his eye.\n\nIn this hour you will wrestle with Sauron and claim mastery over this powerful tool and use it in your quest."
 saruman.0002.a:0 "I will find the One Ring. And bring order to Middle-earth."
 saruman.0002.a.tt:0 "You gaze into the palantír."

 saruman.0003.t:0 "The Palantír"
 saruman.0003.desc:0 "In the darkness of your throne room, the black cloth is lifted, you reach out towards the crystal ball and command it to show you the One Ring. It respects your power and sweeps over the Gladden Fields. The scene is visible, wilderness of marshlands, the Gladden Fields, where you have searched ceaselessly to discover the Ring. It is not there. You search further and are directed over Mirkwood and towards the Sea of Rhûn, where you observe the endless armies of the Men of Rhûn, but someone else is watching.\n\nSauron has found you; concealed within his fortress, the Lord of Mordor sees all with the captured Ithil Stone. His form is a great eye, lidless, wreathed in flame. His reaching flames pierce through the palantír and drive into your arms, he is seeking to learn your designs. The vision of the palantír shows scenes of Sauron’s utter conquest of the east and south. Sauron does not know yet of your purpose, but you must either deceive him, feigning allegiance, or you must fight for control of the palantír."
 saruman.0003.a:0 "Saruman pledges allegiance to you, lord Sauron."
 saruman.0003.a.tt:0 "Pledge allegiance to Sauron, convert to the Cult of the Lidless Eye. Continue your search to claim the One Ring."

Yet these orcs seem far too organized to be come out of the mountains, and they bear a strange mark - a White Hand on a field of black. At this late hour, what new foe do we face? The White Wizard has grown reclusive of late, and my heart forebodes the long silence of Isengard has not been contemplation, but preparation."

We can scarce endure it, but we must. We find at last a surviving villager, who tells us the whole harrowing tale. Dunlending raiders and orcs bearing great plate armour branded with the reported White Hand struck them in the morning. Through the chaos of the slaughter, he claims to have heard the name of Saruman mentioned by both the Orcs and the Dunlendings while he hid. So what I feared is true. Saruman has betrayed us."

I quickly relate to him the reports I have received from the Westfold. He looks at me, taken aback, before recovering quickly. He assures me it must be a trick of the Enemy, for Saruman has long and faithfully held the border as a friend of Rohan. Excusing himself, he goes to try to confer with my father. \n\nGríma returned in a few hours, handing me a scroll with a command from the King. Kindly, Gríma tells me not to think too harshly of my father, for he remains not well. Father's decree reads that I am to ride with a force to the Isen to investigate these reports personally.

The world, so long shadowed and grey, begins to seem lighter, crisper. At long last your weary eyes focus upon the character to your right. \n\nYou know this face. Éowyn, your niece. She helps you to stand before you turn your gaze to the petitioner before your throne. Standing there, clad in white, is Gandalf, and yet it is not. At my recognition, he gives a tired but content sigh, bidding me to breath the free air again. \n\nLater that day, you stand before the tomb that was raised for your son, his remains now entombed therein.

In mere moments years of preparation, painstakingly hidden, have been undone by a force he had never thought to factor into his plans. \n\nHe is safe enough in the Orthanc, but what remains of his armies are quickly being smashed beneath the terrible fury of the Onodrim. Just when it seems things cannot get any worse, the Ents break the great dam that had been erected upon the Isen. All at once, the reservoir of water comes rushing forth in a mighty wave, a small recreation of Akallabêth. And just as pride had brought low the Númenóreans, so too have all the works of Saruman's cunning mind of steel now been unmade by the fury of nature. \n\nHe is now a prisoner within what once was his seat of power."

 theodred.0117.t:0 "The March of the Ents"
 theodred.0117.desc:0 "A great power, ancient in birth and might, has awoken and changed the course of the world, unlooked for and unexpected. From deep within the forest of Fangorn the ancient Onodrim, known to Men as the Ents, marched to war against Isengard, seeking vengeance against the power-hungry Saruman. \n\nIn a brutally decisive battle, the Ring of Isengard has been torn down, and its pits have been flooded by the Isen, flooding the region when the Ents broke the great damn Saruman had built there. Saruman is now a prisoner within his own tower, the Ents having hunted every last Uruk-hai in the region. \n\nThe Children of Yavanna have dealt a decisive blow against the darkness this day."
 theodred.0117.a:0 "There is yet hope for Men!"
 theodred.0117.b:0 "Cursed Man-folk! They delay only the inevitable!"
 
 theodred.0118.t:0 "Saruman's Choice"
 theodred.0118.desc:0 "Théoden King has arrived to the flooded Ring of Isengard with his royal retinue, and Saruman has no choice but to listen to the Horse-lord's demands. \n\nThe aging king lists the multitude of crimes committed by the White Wizard against his people, and demands that he come down from the tower of Orthanc. He shall relinquish the keys of Orthanc to him, having betrayed the trust given him as its warden and keeper, and then shall Théoden judge him for his crimes by the laws of Men. \n\nShould he refuse, Saruman will lose all right to trial and his fate will be sealed absolutely."
 theodred.0118.a:0 "Never shall I be made a subject!"
 theodred.0118.b:0 "Clemency is my only course."
 
 theodred.0119.t:0 "Saruman's Choice"
 theodred.0119.desc:0 "Saruman responds derisively to the offer of clemency and trial, stating that a lord of a thatched barn has no right to judge him! \n\nThéoden, spying Gríma on the balcony with Saruman, bids him come down and accept the clemency of the crown. He implores Gríma, asking that he remember that he served him loyally for many years, and that he was once a man of honour and integrity before the lies of Saruman poisoned him. For a moment Gríma wavers, and it seems he will accept - but then the White Wizard laughs, cold and fell, full of deep malice. \n\nFree? He shall never be free!\n\n Gríma's face twists into terrible, burning hate, before he seems to steel himself. Saruman, beginning to speak again, suddenly gives out a hushed gasp as the air rushes out him in shock. Gríma has stabbed him, and the pressure of the stab forces the proud Istari over the edge, sending him plummeting towards the bottom of Orthanc. \n\nSo passes the would-be ruler of the world, Saruman the White, so proud and vain, undone by a beaten dog."

 theodred.0120.a:0 "There shall be no mercy!"

But now securely entrenched, there seems little reason to continue the charade. You have long desired to not merely equal Sauron, but to even surpass him - you too are a Ringmaker, and a master of the deep lore. \n\nSauron is a cudgel, forcing the world into his vision by brute might. You are a more subtle, less destructive master - your rule would bring prosperity and peace, under your wise leadership. \n\nBut Sauron is mighty - much of the East and the South is under his sway. Dare you risk it?"

You, who was the lieutenant of Angband and Utunmo, who brought low mighty Númenor, lord of the South and East, he deludes himself and deems himself your equal? \n\nWell, let Curumo try to dethrone you. He will be brought before the Great Eye, and know torment unending for his treachery."
