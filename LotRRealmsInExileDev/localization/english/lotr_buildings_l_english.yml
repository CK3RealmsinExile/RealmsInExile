The Mírdain hosted classes and debates for all who wished to join them, and fostered a vibrant and dynamic intellectual center. It was not uncommon to find apprentices running to and fro, or to find Dwarves from nearby [khazaddum|E] in its halls.\n\nPatronized, established, and led by [celebrimbor|E] himself, the works wrought in these halls are of no less legend than the makers themselves, and created fabulous wealth and prestige for all involved."

Only by establishing strict regulations about the materials and designs of our arms and armor can we avoid these flaws.

With a rhythmic tune from their lock step mixed with long trumpet blares and slow beating drums, they sing a song of goodbye to those who gathered around to watch the parade. A song for their families. A song for their friends. A song for their loved ones. Those who many might never see again. But these warriors go not because they are forced to, but because they are brave enough to know that they must defend their homes. All so that those left behind can live in safety. It's never an easy choice, but these Dwarves carry a heavy burden on their shoulders. The fate of our home rests with them, and we shall give them everything for their sacrifice."

Atop the ceiling it shall be littered with sapphires and diamonds, and given just enough light to cause them to twinkle like stars in the night sky.

Our artisans have worked day and night to ensure that every building, bridge and path has been crafted to exquisite perfection. Quaint bridges span over the subterranean waters, their crystalline waters reflecting the radiant hues of light that spill in through cleverly dug out cracks in the rocky ceiling above. And in the center of it all is our grand palace. Intricately designed and excessive in all manners, it is a place the Fathers themselves would hold in esteem.

Established by King Terilaen, the halls were built as the [cuind|E] consolidated southwards. As [conceptracemen|E] migrated into the [harad|E], the [cuind|E] began to feel enclosed in the narrow lands by the sea, and retreated southward before the oncoming tribes. Eventually, King Meglasûl brought the greater part of his people to the utter south and the Cape of Drel, and began the construction of the capital of his new realm. But even ere the foundations had been completed, he wearied of his new confines and the ever-growing presence of men, and sailed west over sea in hope of the wider lands beyond.\n\n His son, Terilaen, was of other mood, and sought friendship and cooperation with the Secondborn of the area. Under his rule, the [cuind|E] tutored them in herblore and handicrafts, and some were even permitted to survey the hidden halls of Cilulend. Amidst the many-branching waterfalls and fountains of the Royal Halls, they there beheld the many wonderous works of the [avari|E], many-threaded webs, goblets of carven wood and crystal, brews and potions of great power, crafted in secret at the heart of the wood though years uncounted. The streets and paths of Cilulend wander among the falls, up and down the cliffside, spilling out onto the forest floor below. Domes and doors lie hidden between the trees, unseen but by a passing glimpse, enmeshed and sheltered by the wood. Throughout all, the pale trees reflect the light of the sparkling waters, and the hushed sound of the springs fills the air. In the centre of the city, at the foot of the greatest of the pools, stands the Royal Hall itself, it's vaulted cover a canopy of woven trees, pillared by silver trunks and lit by many-faced crystal, set in streams and fountains flowing along the aisles. Here the Hidden King receives his guests in splendour, but more often his high seat sits empty, as he wanders amongst the mortals he loves so well."

Following the war the city was given an [adunaic|E] name and removed from the administration of An-Balkûmagân. The King rewarded the city for its loyalty by giving it its own colonial charter to act autonomously under the new colony of [zimrathani|E]. Thus the city grew to match the splendour of the cities of [anbalkumagan|E] and [bellakar|E], drawing many Adûnaic settlers, yet this prosperity would not last, as the foundation of many other cities in Zimrathâni and Gimilthâni led to ferocious competition between the cities, which gave rise to a powerful mercantile culture and a reputation of fierce sailors and shrewd merchants.\n\nThe merchant fleets of the city have purportedly gone as far north as the ancient havens of Pelargir and [umbar|E], brining back many goods back to the city, to the benefit of the mercantile families, which have grown powerful enough that some would say dominate the city, and that the Princes do so only in name."

Lond Hallacar) and to maintain control over the hinterlands of Pél and the [numenorean|E] tributary kingdoms there. The colony prospered greatly from the tribute that it received from its tributaries, and the tariffs it imposed on trade, as it had an advantageous position between the Eastern trade routes and the Western trade routes of [ardaconcept|E]. It would also receive many of the ships from Ardinâk when the island fell in S.A. 2548, sharing the responsability of the eastern Númenórean fleet with Anarikê, which gained them prestige and wealth. However, Lôni Hîsekhôr was not as thoroughly settled as the other colonies of the [thanihazad|E], with the few Númenórean settlers forming the elite of the colony, ruling over the local Pél people, which would cause some cultural friction.\n\nWhen Tantûrak rebelled in the later [secondage|E] with aid from the Empire of Mûmakan, they dismembered the Republic of Kôronânde, bringing most of the south in league with them, and hostile to [numenor|E], causing trade to come to a halt, damaging Lôni Hîsekhôr source of revenue. When Ar-Pharazôn finally took action against Tantûraks rebellion by commanding the Colonies of the Thâni-Hazâd and Anarikê to crush the rebellion, Lôni Hîsekhôr became an important waypoint for the fleets of [zimrathani|E], which saw revenue flowing into the colony once more.\n\nAfter the rebellion was crushed, Ar-Pharazôn set his mind on building a Great Armament to invade the [undyinglands|E], and Lôni Hîsekhôr was not spared from having to supply it, further weakening the struggling colony. This left them in a precarious situation following the [akallabeth|E], as there was not the manpower nor the will to rebuild the city. This caused the Númenórean colonial elite of the city to relocate to the western Thâni-Hazâd, leaving the ancient city as a ruin."

Eventually, the former tributary kingdoms of Pél, now independent, gave the name Arpél to the ancient ruins. However, during the domination of the twin crowns of Mag and Tûmag, the ancient ruins were renamed to Katerre, and utilised as a natural harbour to ensure their control over the Pél people and their continued subjugation.\n\nThis all changed in T.A. 1203, when a coalition of Pél rebels invited the [balan_lai|E] to aid them in their rebellion in exchange for fealty under their authority, though under their terms and with significant autonomy. This surprised the Balân-lâi, as they had long held the belief that Pél was a land better left independent, as it was too isolated and underdeveloped to be worth ruling. However, after much deliberation, it was agreed that they would aid the rebels and in exchange an [adunaic|E] noble would take the mantle of Prince of Pél. Thus the Balân-lâi aided the rebels, and Sapazûr Agathôhin, a supposed descendant of an old colonial noble of Lôni Hîsekhôr and of no connection to the other Kharadûnai dynasties was chosen as Prince. Lôni Hîsekhôr was afterwards rebuilt, although the name of Arpél had gained much popularity, it was decided to utilise the old colonial name as well, to appease the Kharadûnaic princes that had sent supplies and soldiers to kick out the twin crowns of Mag and Tûmag.\n\nThe newly rebuilt Arpél would house the Council of Pél, in which all the tribes of the Princedom would sent a representative to govern alongside the Adûnaic prince. This meant that the new Princedom, and its capital, would stay away from the intrigue and conflicts of the [thanihazad|E]. It would also be home to the restored and expanded Harbour of Arpél, which would be utilised to aid the ships of the realms of Thâni-Hazâd in trading with the eastern realms of [ardaconcept|E]."

The vibrant greenery surrounding the structure is carefully tended, symbolising their commitment to renewal. As they clear the debris and restore the carvings, echoes of laughter and strength reverberate through the air.\n\nSparring matches and rituals of strength reemerge, framed by a deepening spiritual awareness. In each movement, they strive to channel [astald_maktal|E]’s spirit, feeling his guidance as they grapple not just with each other but with their own inner battles.\n\nThe environment hums with a sense of purpose, where physical prowess intertwines with meditation, reinforcing their bond with the Valiant Warrior."

 building_wonder_ardinak_01:0 "Shân-ta-Rhôn"
 building_wonder_ardinak_01_desc:0 "The island now known as Ardinâk was first settled by the Kinn-lai Avari, who gave it the name Dirsulinor. Yet the lands of Middle-earth were not free of the shadow of Morgoth, even so far from the seat of his power. Many of Morgoth's soldiers had been scattered to the winds in the Battle of the Powers, awaiting their master's return. And one such fled to the isolated island which would later be known as Ardinaak. Here it bided its time, but the coming of the Kinn-lai alarmed it, and it prepared to strike them in turn. This was no Balrog, or even mighty servant, but it was subtle and long prepared, making poisons and other foul arts in the depths of the isle. King Tainalânn came to investigate the seemingly cursed isle, and though he slew the beast, he was slain in turn. And in its death throes it laid a ruinous curse on the isle, and the Kinn-lai fled.\n\nLong years later in the [secondage|E] came the [numenoreans|E], who claimed the isle for their own. The Númenóreans established Ardinâk as a naval outpost, and in time, it grew in might, casting the shadow of their dominion over much of the northeastern reaches of the Bay of Ûsakan. Upon the island, they raised the citadel of Ardinâk, also called the Shân-ta-Rhôn, a stronghold wrought from black marble and steel, a symbol of [numenor|E]'s strength and mastery of the seas.\n\nYet doom befell Ardinâk. In the year S.A. 1888, a great and terrible plague swept over the island, laying low its people. Those who could fled to the mainland, while others perished in agony, leaving the once-proud citadel abandoned to ruin. From that time forth, Ardinâk was deemed accursed by all who heard the tale of its fall. The Númenórean colony of Tantûrak, which had once held the navy's power, fell into decline, for the fleet was withdrawn and sent either to Anarikê or to Zimrathâni. Tantûrak, bereft of its former importance, grew neglected, and its loyalty to the motherland of Númenor waned with the passing of years."

 building_wonder_sarul_01_desc:0 "The city of Sarûl is a monument to unfulfilled ambitions. Originally a hastily constructed outpost after the evacuation of Ardinâk, it grew in fits and starts, organic but not efficient. After Ar-Kinyârn declared his independence from [numenor|E], it did not bring his native subjects the relief they had hoped. Instead, Ar-Kinyârn utilized the taxes and forced labor which had formerly gone to the homeland in order to refurbish his capital. The old cramped streets were done away with, grand imperial boulevards taking their place, designed after those of [armenelos|E] itself. The buildings were replaced, their stones repurposed for new, more grander ones, all finely ornated (though much of these were stripped when the [numenoreans|E] exacted their retribution on their rebellious [colony|E]). It was to be the beating heart of a new imperial realm, one that would hold the entirety of the south in its thrall."

 building_wonder_sarul_rebuilt_01_desc:0 "The dream never came to pass, and as such, Sarûl's grand streets and imposing buildings became testaments to arrogance. There were not enough people to populate all its halls, and so the indolent nobility concentrated into the city's core, with the outer districts left to rot. After the fall of Tantûrak to native revolt in T.A. 1450, the city further degraded. What remains of its infastructure and buildings are still somewhat usable, but it is a pale shadow of what its designer dreamed and many parts are long overgrown, with the new populace wondering what many of these ancient houses once housed, and who lived in them."
