It was not uncommon to find apprentices running to and fro, or to find Dwarves from nearby [khazaddum|E] in its halls.\n\nPatronized, established, and led by [celebrimbor|E] himself, the works wrought in these halls are of no less legend than the makers themselves, and created fabulous wealth and prestige for all involved."

 building_wonder_hall_of_tiralaen_desc:0 "The Cilulend, or Flows of Beauty, are the great halls and city of the [cuind|E]. Established by King Terilaen, the halls were built as the [cuind|E] consolidated southwards. As [conceptracemen|E] migrated into the [harad|E], the [cuind|E] began to feel enclosed in the narrow lands by the sea, and retreated southward before the oncoming tribes. Eventually, King Meglasûl brought the greater part of his people to the utter south and the Cape of Drel, and began the construction of the capital of his new realm. But even ere the foundations had been completed, he wearied of his new confines and the ever-growing presence of men, and sailed west over sea in hope of the wider lands beyond.\n\n His son, Terilaen, was of other mood, and sought friendship and cooperation with the Secondborn of the area. Under his rule, the [cuind|E] tutored them in herblore and handicrafts, and some were even permitted to survey the hidden halls of Cilulend. Amidst the many-branching waterfalls and fountains of the Royal Halls, they there beheld the many wonderous works of the [avari|E], many-threaded webs, goblets of carven wood and crystal, brews and potions of great power, crafted in secret at the heart of the wood though years uncounted. The streets and paths of Cilulend wander among the falls, up and down the cliffside, spilling out onto the forest floor below. Domes and doors lie hidden between the trees, unseen but by a passing glimpse, enmeshed and sheltered by the wood. Throughout all, the pale trees reflect the light of the sparkling waters, and the hushed sound of the springs fills the air. In the centre of the city, at the foot of the greatest of the pools, stands the Royal Hall itself, it's vaulted cover a canopy of woven trees, pillared by silver trunks and lit by many-faced crystal, set in streams and fountains flowing along the aisles. Here the Hidden King receives his guests in splendour, but more often his high seat sits empty, as he wanders amongst the mortals he loves so well."

Nestled within a narrow passageway between the imposing peaks and the vast expanse of the sea, this citadel commands a pivotal position along a crucial arterial trading route in the [thanihazad|E].\n\nThe Great Citadel of Azarîdêth is more than just a fortress; it is a symbol of strength, resilience, and the enduring spirit of those who call this ancient city home.

Following the war the city was given an [adunaic|E] name and removed from the administration of An-Balkûmagân. The King rewarded the city for its loyalty by giving it its own colonial charter to act autonomously under the new colony of [zimrathani|E]. Thus the city grew to match the splendour of the cities of [anbalkumagan|E] and [bellakar|E], drawing many Adûnaic settlers, yet this prosperity would not last, as the foundation of many other cities in Zimrathâni and Gimilthâni led to ferocious competition between the cities, which gave rise to a powerful mercantile culture and a reputation of fierce sailors and shrewd merchants.\n\nThe merchant fleets of the city have purportedly gone as far north as the ancient havens of Pelargir and [umbar|E], brining back many goods back to the city, to the benefit of the mercantile families, which have grown powerful enough that some would say dominate the city, and that the Princes do so only in name."

Lond Hallacar) and to maintain control over the hinterlands of Pél and the [numenorean|E] tributary kingdoms there. The colony prospered greatly from the tribute that it received from its tributaries, and the tariffs it imposed on trade, as it had an advantageous position between the Eastern trade routes and the Western trade routes of [arda|E]. It would also receive many of the ships from Ardinâk when the island fell in S.A. 2548, sharing the responsability of the eastern Númenórean fleet with Anarikê, which gained them prestige and wealth. However, Lôni Hîsekhôr was not as thoroughly settled as the other colonies of the [thanihazad|E], with the few Númenórean settlers forming the elite of the colony, ruling over the local Pél people, which would cause some cultural friction.\n\nWhen Tantûrak rebelled in the later [secondage|E] with aid from the Empire of Mûmakan, they dismembered the Republic of Kôronânde, bringing most of the south in league with them, and hostile to [numenor|E], causing trade to come to a halt, damaging Lôni Hîsekhôr source of revenue. When Ar-Pharazôn finally took action against Tantûraks rebellion by commanding the Colonies of the Thâni-Hazâd and Anarikê to crush the rebellion, Lôni Hîsekhôr became an important waypoint for the fleets of [zimrathani|E], which saw revenue flowing into the colony once more.\n\nAfter the rebellion was crushed, Ar-Pharazôn set his mind on building a Great Armament to invade the [undyinglands|E], and Lôni Hîsekhôr was not spared from having to supply it, further weakening the struggling colony. This left them in a precarious situation following the [akallabeth|E], as there was not the manpower nor the will to rebuild the city. This caused the Númenórean colonial elite of the city to relocate to the western Thâni-Hazâd, leaving the ancient city as a ruin."

Eventually, the former tributary kingdoms of Pél, now independent, gave the name Arpél to the ancient ruins. However, during the domination of the twin crowns of Mag and Tûmag, the ancient ruins were renamed to Katerre, and utilised as a natural harbour to ensure their control over the Pél people and their continued subjugation.\n\nThis all changed in T.A. 1203, when a coalition of Pél rebels invited the [balan_lai|E] to aid them in their rebellion in exchange for fealty under their authority, though under their terms and with significant autonomy. This surprised the Balân-lâi, as they had long held the belief that Pél was a land better left independent, as it was too isolated and underdeveloped to be worth ruling. However, after much deliberation, it was agreed that they would aid the rebels and in exchange an [adunaic|E] noble would take the mantle of Prince of Pél. Thus the Balân-lâi aided the rebels, and Sapazûr Agathôhin, a supposed descendant of an old colonial noble of Lôni Hîsekhôr and of no connection to the other Kharadûnai dynasties was chosen as Prince. Lôni Hîsekhôr was afterwards rebuilt, although the name of Arpél had gained much popularity, it was decided to utilise the old colonial name as well, to appease the Kharadûnaic princes that had sent supplies and soldiers to kick out the twin crowns of Mag and Tûmag.\n\nThe newly rebuilt Arpél would house the Council of Pél, in which all the tribes of the Princedom would sent a representative to govern alongside the Adûnaic prince. This meant that the new Princedom, and its capital, would stay away from the intrigue and conflicts of the [thanihazad|E]. It would also be home to the restored and expanded Harbour of Arpél, which would be utilised to aid the ships of the realms of Thâni-Hazâd in trading with the eastern realms of [arda|E]."

 building_wonder_ardinak_01_desc:0 "The island now known as Ardinâk was first inhabited by the Kinnlai Avari, who named it Dirsulinor, until it was colonised by the Númenóreans in the Second Age. The Númenóreans would utilise Ardinâk as a naval outpost, in time this outpost would project power across much of the northeastern portion of the Bay of Ûsakan. Here was built the citadel of Ardinâk, also known as the Shân-ta-Rhôn, said to be built of black marble and steel. However, a terrible plague destroyed Ardinâk in S.A. 1888, which caused the inhabitants to flee to the mainland or die painful deaths, this would lead to the island of Ardinâk being deemed cursed by all those who had heard tales about the horror which had happened there and a loss in importance for Tantûrak , which would no longer house the Númenórean Navy (which was transferred to either Anarikê or to Zimrathâni), and Tantûrak became perhaps the most neglected of the Númenórean colonies. As a result, Tantûrak would increasingly lose loyalty to the mother-country."

Originally a hastily constructed outpost after the evacuation of Ardinâk, it grew in fits and starts, organic but not efficient. After Ar-Kinyârn declared his independence from [numenor|E], it did not bring his native subjects the relief they had hoped. Instead, Ar-Kinyârn utilized the taxes and forced labor which had formerly gone to the homeland in order to refurbish his capital. The old cramped streets were done away with, grand imperial boulevards taking their place, designed after those of [armenelos|E] itself. The buildings were replaced, their stones repurposed for new, more grander ones, all finely ornated (though much of these were stripped when the [numenoreans|E] exacted their retribution on their rebellious [colony|E]). It was to be the beating heart of a new imperial realm, one that would hold the entirety of the south in its thrall."

There were not enough people to populate all its halls, and so the indolent nobility concentrated into the city's core, with the outer districts left to rot. After the fall of Tantûrak to native revolt in T.A. 1450, the city further degraded. What remains of its infastructure and buildings are still somewhat usable, but it is a pale shadow of what its designer dreamed and many parts are long overgrown, with the new populace wondering what many of these ancient houses once housed, and who lived in them."
