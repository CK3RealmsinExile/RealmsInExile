However these feudatories gradually grew in strength just as the Dúnedain population declined, with their leaders asserting control over more and more of the province until House Guinion ruled in name only. After the Devastation of 1409 they evicted the last lord of Mistalondë from his ancestral seat.\n\nRenamed ‘Súthure’ in their tongue, Mistalondë became the capital of the Saralain kingdom that emerged as Cardolan’s control evaporated. Though much diminished, and largely ruined by time and centuries of fighting among the people of Saralain, Súthure remains one of the few significant settlements of Eriador.\n\nIts harbour and markets remain the centre of the limited trade of coastal Enedwaith and Minhiriath, and while its ancient walls have long since toppled, a smaller defensive ring has been raised from the broken stonework of many a collapsed hall and warehouse."

At a later time numerous Edainic barrows were constructed near the shrine, in number second only to Tyrn Gorthad. \n\nA key site of early Númenoréan contact, the eponymous ‘Three Faithful’ were according to legend Númenórean mariners who remained among the indigenous people of Evendim, long before any concerted attempt at settlement. \n\nAfter the arrival of the Númenóreans Nelvorin became a centre of learning, and a symbol of the ancient and continuous presence of the Edainic peoples and their descendants in the Emyn Uial.

  building_wonder_beorns_hall_desc:0 "Even after his reluctant acceptance of leadership in the Vale, Beorn continued to reside in the great hall that he had built with his own hands years before. In part this was because he was stuck in his ways, but he was also canny in his recognition that moving the seat of power to the heartland of any one tribe would be regarded as favouritism among the factious people of wood and vale. A significant settlement, Beornsele, grew up around the hall, but the original structure retained much of its character, including its famous hives - and gruesome displays of orc heads."

  building_wonder_sairthiudabaurg_desc:0 "Despite the transient nature of most Woodmen tribes and realms, the Sairthiuda have remained a distinct people for time out of mind. Uniquely, they retain a memory of the early contact between the Woodmen and the Galadhrim, and this is most clearly expressed in the ancient settlement of Sairthiudabaurg. Influenced by the flets of Lothlorien, the Sairthiuda’s ancient home is entirely above ground. An ingenious network of concealed platforms linked by artful sky-bridges and rope walkways are held aloft by a combination of ingenious carpentry and the ancient trees of the forest itself, such that some Sairthiuda are said to never touch the ground, and to fear it. \n\nA source of enormous pride for the woodmen, and regarded as a deeply sacred place, Sairthiudabaurg is also difficult for any enemy to attack due to its skillful concealment and the constant threat of arrows and other projectiles raining down from above; many a raiding party has been slaughtered in the space of a breath without even realising that their futile march had reached the sky-city of the Sairthiuda."

He made his second capital at Amarthrynd in c.2255 of the Second Age, on an ancient site of Silvan culture and authority, indicative of how he had taken their customs for his own. \n\nUnlike Oropher's heir Thranduil's later capital of Aradhrynd, the halls of Amarthrynd were primarily above ground, in a palace complex supported by pillars formed from living trees. However, the palace was connected to the caverns which gave the settlement its name, known for their pristine and tranquil beauty. Long held by the Silvans as an intensely spiritual place for contemplation and retreat, Oropher further magnified the natural radiance of the caverns with the knowledge of the Sindar, such that those who beheld them thought that they could glean into the very song of the world, embedded in rock and stone."

When the time came for Thranduil to build a capital in the north of Greenwood it was Elu Thingol’s great halls of Menegroth that inspired him. And like the Greycloak, Thranduil enlisted the Dwarves to delve and shape his subterranean capital. \n\nProtected by stone doors secured by cunning magic, Aradhyrnd is both a mighty refuge and the heart of the Woodland Realm. Its many halls, supported by pillars of living rock, contain great store of goods and treasure. Beneath them lie dungeons in which unwanted visitors can be forgotten, and cellars built over streams leading into the Forest River, giving Aradhyrnd access to the river trade with Dale and beyond."

For long centuries it has been home to one of the cruellest of Rhûn’s myriad cults.
