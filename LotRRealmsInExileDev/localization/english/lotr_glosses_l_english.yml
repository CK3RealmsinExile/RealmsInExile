 # Documentation - By Trig
 # Formatting gloss tooltips: [Glossary('gloss_txt','GLOSS_KEY')], where "gloss text" is the tooltip, and "GLOSS_KEY" links to the gloss itself. 
 # Example: " [Glossary( 'Pax Romana', 'PAX_ROMANA_GLOSS' )] "
 # Formating gloss definititons: GLOSS_KEY: "gloss_tooltip", where "gloss_tooltip" is the translation of the gloss
 # Example: PAX_ROMANA_GLOSS: "The #bold Pax Romana#! — a Latin phrase meaning "The Roman Peace" — has been historically used to describe the period of "peace" inaugurated by Augustus' victory at Actium. This phrase does not refer to an absence of war, but rather means that all Rome's foes were subdued."

 # Best practice for Realms: place all gloss defintitions here, for easy acess, under the correct language alphabetiacally. If possible, mention where it is used for reference.
