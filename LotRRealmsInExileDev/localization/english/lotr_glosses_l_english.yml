### Potential fix for CTD #2: Elven naming conventions

# anessi_gloss: "The [quenya_short|E]#bold Anessi#!, the 'given-names', are the public names given to an [elf|E] at various different points in their life. The three kinds of Anessi of the [highelves|E] are the [ataresse|E], [amilesse|E], and [epesse|E]. The elven given-names, especially the Ataressë and Amilessë were typically recorded in [quenya|E] or [sindarin|E], though there are records of various other languages being used as well, including Telerin and a Sindarinized version of [khuzdul|E]."
# ataresse_gloss: "[quenya_short|E]#bold Ataressë#!, 'father-name', is the name given to an [elf|E] at or near birth by their father and is considered one of the Elf's true names. It is one of the [anessi|E] of [highelves|E], along with the [amilesse|E] and [epesse|E]. The father-name is a public name, often derived from his own name, announced in a ceremony called Essecarmë ('name-making'). It was often the primary name of an Elf until he or she chose to adopt an epessë given to them.\n\nAn example is [finrod_felagund|E], whose father-name was Findaráto ('Golden-Haired Champion') and epessë was [Glossary('Felagund','felagund_gloss')]. The name Finrod is the [sindarin|E] version of his father-name."
# amilesse_gloss: "[quenya_short|E]#bold Amilessë#!, 'mother-name', is the name given to an [elf|E] at or some years after birth by their mother and is one of the Elf's true names. It is one of the [anessi|E] of [highelves|E], along with the [ataresse|E] and [epesse|E]. The mother-name is a public name, significant because Elven mothers often had great insight into the characters and abilities of their children and may also have had the gift of prophetic foresight into their children's futures.\n\nThe most common type of mother-name is the amilessë tercenyë ('mother-name of insight'), given to the child as their personality began to develop, some years after birth. The amilessë apacenyë ('mother-name of foresight') was a rarer occurrence, given to the child from a vision of their special fate that the mother received in the hour of birth."
# epesse_gloss: "[quenya_short|E]#bold Epessë#!, 'after-name', is the nickname or honourific given to an [elf|E] at some point in their life and is sometimes considered one of the Elf's true names. It is one of the [anessi|E] of [highelves|E], along with the [ataresse|E] and [amilesse|E]. The after-name is a public name, often given to the Elf because of some trait they have or deed they have undertaken, and often became the Elf's primary name, replacing the father-name.\n\nThe most well-known epessë is likely the [sindarin|E] name Galadriel, meaning 'Maiden Crowned with Radiant Garland'. Her father-name was Artanis, meaning 'Noble Woman', her mother-name was Nerwen, meaning 'Man-Maiden'. She also went by the original Telerin version of Alatáriel and its translation to her native [quenya|E], Altáriel."
# kilmesse_gloss: "[quenya_short|E]#bold Kilmessë#!, 'self-name', is the often much more private name of an [elf|E], used as a disguise or referring to their deeds or personal history. It is separate from the [anessi|E], and few of them are recorded compared to the Anessi, especially as [ages|E] passed."
