 # Example: PAX_ROMANA_GLOSS: "The #bold Pax Romana#! — a Latin phrase meaning "The Roman Peace" — has been historically used to describe the period of "peace" inaugurated by Augustus' victory at Actium. This phrase does not refer to an absence of war, but rather means that all Rome's foes were subdued."
