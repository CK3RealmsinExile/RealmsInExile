A wide, flat area, nestled against the peak, has long ago been prepared for the purposes of this prayer.\n\nThe baggage trains unload, the grain piled high before the great altar under the open sky. No chapel is there here; no great edifice of humanity's make. The chapel of the gods is here - the ceiling is the firmament, the floor the earth itself.\n\nWhen all the preperations of completed, I make my way to the great altar. Utter silence descends, as I prepare to begin..." #We are in the hallow! We gather around, loredump, offer of grain, I prepare to speak the prayers

See now the fruits of the earth, which your people have toiled to sow; may your mercy multiply this one-hundred fold, that days of plenty may succor our bodies, and show the glory of your eternal and merciful reign. May you watch over us in this upcoming year, as you have the past, protecting us from our foes. May your bring peace and plenty to the earth, quell evil, and uphold righteousness.\n\nAs you swore to the Kings of Old, may you uphold still. Grant us wisdom to rule your people justly. If we should stray, rebuke us, and guide us to the righteous path."\n\nThe prayer runs long, as it ever does - no two are every truly alike. Yet at last it falls silent. I bask in the quiet, straining to feel the presence of [ROOT.Char.Custom('firstfruits_invoked_deity')]." #I invoke Eru and Ladnoca, give prayer, offer fruit/grain/whatevs, invent ceremonial stuff. I feel their presence! We go back down the mountain.
 firstfruits.0033.desc.generic: ""[ROOT.Char.Custom('firstfruits_invoked_deity')], see here the offerings of your faithful people. May you grant them your favor and blessing in the year to come; that this gift of grain may be returned one-hundred fold. May rain come, yet not flood; may sun shine, yet not punish; may the harvest be many, and our burden light."\n\nWith the prayer said, I motion to the assistants, who take part of the grain. This shall be made into communal bread, free for all to enjoy at the festival. The remainder is set alight, the smoke ascending to the heavens." #I invoke XY god/s, give prayer, offer fruit/grain/whatevs, invent ceremonial stuff. We head to and begin the proper celebration

 firstfruits.0034.desc: "With the prayers spoken and the offerings of grain made, the time for solemnity has passed.\n\nNow comes the time for joy and celebration! My voice booms as I give the command to finally set the tables for all, to crack open the alcohol, and to begin the music. The people will greatly appreciate my largess, I am sure!\n\nSoon the festival is in full swing - games, entertainers, and other exotic curiosities fill stalls and street alike as the people throng, savoring in the chance to relax and enjoy their community.\n\nLong does the celebration run, spanning many days, before at last everyone heads home, content and in good spirits." # Finally big celebratory feast, everyone is invited, fruit everywhere, fun stuff. I have bought a lot of fruit to gift to the commoners, as is tradition. Yay. Conclusion paragraph: We had a good time.
