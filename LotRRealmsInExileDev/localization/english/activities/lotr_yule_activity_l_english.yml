 # Events
 yule.0020.t: "Preparations"
 yule.0020.desc: "The Winter Solstice will soon be upon us, and that means it will be time to celebrate the #italic Yuletide#! festival. This is an old tradition of the northern lands commemorating the changing of year and seasons.\n\nThis time, I will be sure to partake in the festivities as well. Perhaps it might be a tad bit rowdy, but on the other hand, it is also a season of gift-giving and sharing of joy and happiness, especially in the colder months."
 yule.0020.a: "Let’s prepare for a great celebration!"
 yule.0021.t: "The Festivities Begin"
 yule.0021.desc: "The #italic Yuletide#! is upon us!\n\nIn the cold winter months, since the days of old long forgotten, everyone – rich and poor, male and female, young and old – has come together like this to make merry, feast on delicious food and drink, and give each other gifts. My residence is full of the kindling of lights, and even from here we can hear the cheers of revelers elsewhere."
 yule.0021.a: "Come, yes, let’s make merry!"
 yule.0022.t: "The Festivities End"
 yule.0022.desc: "The #italic Yuletide#! has come to an end, and all the rowdy noise and merriment around us is dying down, as normal life begins to reassert itself.\n\nIt was a merry occasion, as it always is, and one can only hope that we can celebrate it again a year from now."
 yule.0022.a: "Back to the struggles of daily life!"
 yule.0023.t: "Gift Exchange"
 yule.0023.desc: "It is a long-established custom that during the #italic Yuletide#!, we give each other gifts. This exchange of gifts is one of the important highlights of the holiday.\n\nI have, of course, done my part and gotten some presents for my household and associates. They, in turn, have done the same for me."
 yule.0023.a: "What lovely presents we’ve exchanged this year!"
 yule.0024.t: "xxxxx"
 yule.0024.desc: "xxxxx"
 yule.0024.a: "xxxxx"
 yule.0025.t: "Disapproving [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')]"
 yule.0025.desc: "While many find the #italic Yuletide#! a fun and enjoyable occasion, not everyone feels the same.\n\n[ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')], for instance, have traditionally been critics of what they see as an overly indulgent festival, a relic of the past long behind us we should be rid of, for it clouds our judgment and insults our common sense. And, of course, as every [hobbit|E] should know - gift-giving is for birthdays, not other celebrations.\n\nLuckily, not everyone pays attention to these killjoys, but [chaplain.GetCouncilTitle] [chaplain.GetTitledFirstName] has been particularly vocal about [chaplain.GetHerHis] disapproval of the festivities lately."
 yule.0025.a: "Order [chaplain.GetHerHim] to not take things so seriously"
 yule.0025.b: "Tell [chaplain.GetHerHim] I'll tone it down in the future"
 yule.0026.t: "Under Heathen Rule"
 yule.0026.desc: "Despite how merry #italic Yuletide#! can be, it is also an important cultural occasion – at least for stout [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetName] people like us living under the rule of a certain [liege.GetFaith.GetAdjective] [liege.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] like [liege.GetFirstName], for example.\n\nIt is through this festive occasion that we can reinforce our dedication to our ancient beliefs and customs, and no one, not even [liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] can wrestle away the pride we feel when we celebrate #italic Yuletide#!. Thus, I have made time to pay the village chief of one our local communities a visit today in between the festivities."
 yule.0026.a: "We are dutiful [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetName] people, even during #italic Yuletide#!."
 yule.0027.t: "Feasting and Drinking"
 yule.0027.desc: "A big part of the #italic Yuletide#! is all the feasting and drinking! This year is no different, and my helpers have put together a splendid, fabulous meal consisting of all manner of [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetName] culinary delights!\n\nIn all honesty, sometimes, there are those who look forward more to the feasting than the rest of this holiday."
 yule.0027.a: "I don’t blame them! Dig in, everyone!"
 yule.0027.b: "Though it’s a holiday, I won’t overdo it."
 yule.0028.t: "The Masquerade"
 yule.0028.desc: "We hear a loud ruckus outside, and take a look to see what’s going on. It turns out to be a throng of partiers putting on a masquerade, with some men dressed as women, some women dressed as men, and some others dressed as animals.\n\nNot everyone in this group appears to be dressed up, but they look like they’re having a lot of fun."
 yule.0028.a: "Hey, why don’t we join in their little parade?"
 yule.0028.b: "I want to dress up as something daring!"
 yule.0028.c: "We can observe the masquerade from here."
 yule.0029.t: "Children's Songs"
 yule.0029.desc: "The voice of children singing Yuletide songs outside is unmistakable. “Yuletide! The Yule has come!” they sing, like a mesmerizing chant.\n\nWhenever such children come around, it is important that we give them some sweets or a bit of gold, for such is the old custom during #italic Yuletide#!.\n\nI open the door, and the dulcet voices of the youngsters fill my ears. Once the singing is over, my servants look to me to give them permission to give the children the sweets and money."
 yule.0029.a: "Go ahead and give candy to the little ones." 
 yule.0029.b: "These lovely children deserve a large gift!" 
 yule.0029.c: "We don’t run a charity here – farewell, kids!" 
 yule.0030.t: "Overdoing It"
 yule.0030.desc: "It is not unexpected for people to consume a bit too much during #italic [activity.Custom( 'YuleName' )]#!.\n\n[eater.GetTitledFirstName], alas, has fallen victim to this problem. During the holiday banquet, [eater.GetSheHe] ate and drank way too much.\n\nHowever, [eater.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] doesn’t want to miss out on the rest of the celebrations!"
 yule.0030.a: "You should get some rest, [eater.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]."
 yule.0031.t: "Contemplations"
 yule.0031.desc: "Gift-giving is an important part of #italic Yuletide#!, but this also means there is a lot of discussion about it.\n\nThat is, some people say there isn’t enough gift-giving, and this is making the holiday worse. Others say there is too much gift-giving, and that this is also ruining the holiday. Yet others are worried about whether they will receive adequate gifts from others."
 yule.0031.a: "It is not the gift but the thought that counts!"
 yule.0031.b: "People need to take gift-giving more seriously."
 yule.0032.t: "Partying"
 yule.0032.desc: "We decided to go into the local town during #italic Yuletide#!. Why? For the partying, of course!\n\nLarge throngs of people have gathered to make merry, and the air is full of excitement and energy. Sure, things might get a little rowdy, but it’s all in good fun!"
 yule.0032.a: "I better join in partying with everyone."
 yule.0032.b: "I’ll just observe from a distance."
 yule.0033.t: "Mixing of Classes"
 yule.0033.desc: "Feasting during #italic Yuletide#! is a given, but one thing that sets these feasts apart from other feasts held during the year is that servants and the poor will join their lords and ladies in the feasting, as if they were equals.\n\nDining together with one’s lessers is not the most unpleasant experience for some, as they get to know their servants and helpers better in the spirit of charity. Yet others dislike such a thing, not wanting to mingle with such lowly types."
 yule.0033.a: "It’s a fun and thoughtful practice."
 yule.0033.b: "I don’t like having to dine with my lessers."
 yule.0034.t: "Foreigners"
 yule.0034.desc: "I know of some foreign merchants and travelers staying nearby. Though their people do not traditionally celebrate #italic Yuletide#!, it is not uncommon for us to invite these outsiders to join us in their celebrations.\n\nSome of the foreigners see the holiday as a wasteful, indulgent occasion, warning their kind to stay away from our “silly” celebrations and revelry. Others, however, don’t mind taking part in the festivities.\n\nPerhaps I should invite the foreigners to join us?"
 yule.0034.a: "Of course. The more the merrier!"
 yule.0034.b: "They probably wouldn’t be interested."
 yule.0035.t: "Elven Visitors"
 yule.0035.desc: "As the Yuletide celebrations move forward, I am surprised to see an unusual visitor observing the festivities from its edges. I approach to find a small group of [elves|E] led by [elven_visitor.GetFirstName] standing just outside the main festival area, clothed in gray cloaks.\n\n"Do not feel disturbed by us," [elven_visitor.GetFirstName] says after introducing [elven_visitor.GetHerselfHimself] and the others. "We merely came to take joy in the merriment of the younger races and hope to gain a bit of inspiration from it. We who yet linger in this chill world have not many reasons for laughter and song in these darkening times.""
 yule.0035.a: "Yuletide is a festival for all merry folk!"
 yule.0035.b: "All right... but don't get too close!"
 yule.0036.t: "A Dwarven Caravan"
 yule.0036.desc: "It is the afternoon of our ongoing Yuletide celebration, and the local town is abuzz with the talk of [dwarves|E]. "Dwarves?" I ask, before swiftly being told that a whole caravan of the hardy, bearded travelers has arrived just a few hours ago, setting up a few stalls in the town's main square.\n\nEver the shrewd businessmakers, the dwarves offer wares from far away lands, high in quality (and price), and much sought-after. I'm sure many of these will make excellent gifts for our Yuletide tradition!"
 yule.0036.a: "The dwarves know such intricate songs and stories."
 yule.0036.b: "Their wares are more than welcome here!"
 yule.0037.t: "A Wizard's Wisdom"
 yule.0037.desc: "I've decided to take a short stroll through the town nearby as the Yuletide Celebration moves forward. Enjoying the festive decorations on the trees, I almost stumble as a tall figure suddenly appears before me. "It's a Wizard! A Wizard has come to celebrate the Yuletide with us!" one of the children playing in the streets exclaims. I take a good look at the stranger before me who smiles knowingly. "Well, it seems I've been found out," he answers, stroking his beard a few times.\n\n"The Yuletide has come again, hasn't it? Ah, how the seasons keep on chasing each other. Come, good people, and forgive my uninvited intrusion into your celebrations. Keep merriment and songs going! It is good to see this old tradition so alive in these parts."\n\nHe looks directly at me, furrowing his brows for a split second. "It is up to you to see that it remains so," he says, before slowly turning away from me and towards one of the bonfires nearby."
 yule.0037.a: "I should keep his advice well in mind..."
 yule.0037.b: "This year's Yuletide will be unforgettable!"
 yule.0038.t: "The Yule Log"
 yule.0038.desc: "During Yuletide, it is tradition for each household who can afford to do so to partake in the preparation of the Yule Log - an entire tree that is to be gradually fed into the fireplace as the festivities continue.\n\nThe time has come for me to decide if I should adhere to this custom. I have more than enough firewood and my fires would be well-fed either way, but can I really afford to bypass such a central piece of the Yuletide Festival?"
 yule.0038.a: "I shall prepare the tree myself!"
 yule.0038.b: "I'll have my servants select a suitable tree to prepare."
 yule.0038.c: "It seems all a bit wasteful to me..."
