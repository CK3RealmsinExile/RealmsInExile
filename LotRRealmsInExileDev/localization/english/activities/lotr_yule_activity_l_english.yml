 activity_yule_context_tooltip: "#emphasis Historical Context:#! The Kalends of January was the traditional New Year's celebration in ancient Rome. Even after the start of the year shifted towards other dates, it was still celebrated in Byzantine-influenced areas of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. By then, the holiday was simply known as Kalends, or Kalandai in medieval Greek, as the other Roman Kalends, i.e. starts of other months, were no longer celebrated. While Byzantine church authorities condemned the Kalends as a heretical pagan practice, it became a symbol of religious Christian identity for Orthodox Christians in Muslim lands. Either way, based on readings of Byzantine and Muslim sources, the Kalends appear to have declined in popularity and disappeared by the 13th or 14th centuries."

 # Events
 yule.0020.t: "Preparations"
 yule.0020.desc: "It will soon be January, and that means it will be time to celebrate the #italic Kalends#! (or #italic Kalends of January#!, as it was known in the days of the ancient Romans. In those days, it marked the start of the new year.\n\nThis time, I will be sure to partake in the festivities as well. Perhaps it might be a tad bit rowdy, but on the other hand, it is also a season of gift-giving and sharing of joy and happiness, especially in the colder months."
 yule.0020.a: "Let’s prepare for a great celebration!"
 yule.0021.t: "The Festivities Begin"
 yule.0021.desc: "The #italic Kalends#! are upon us!\n\nIn the cold winter months, since the days of the ancient Romans, everyone – rich and poor, male and female, young and old – has come together like this to make merry, feast on delicious food and drink, and give each other gifts. My residence is full of the kindling of lights, and even from here we can hear the cheers of revelers elsewhere."
 yule.0021.a: "Come, yes, let’s make merry!"
 yule.0022.t: "The Festivities End"
 yule.0022.desc: "The #italic Kalends#! has come to an end, and all the rowdy noise and merriment around us is dying down, as normal life begins to reassert itself.\n\nIt was a merry occasion, as it always is, and one can only hope that we can celebrate it again a year from now."
 yule.0022.a: "Back to the struggles of daily life!"
 yule.0023.t: "Gift Exchange"
 yule.0023.desc: "It is a long-established custom that during the #italic Kalends#!, we give each other gifts. This exchange of gifts is one of the important highlights of the holiday.\n\nI have, of course, done my part and gotten some presents for my household and associates. They, in turn, have done the same for me."
 yule.0023.a: "What lovely presents we’ve exchanged this year!"
 yule.0024.t: "xxxxx"
 yule.0024.desc: "xxxxx"
 yule.0024.a: "xxxxx"
 yule.0025.t: "Disapproving [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')]"
 yule.0025.desc: "While many find the #italic Kalends#! a fun and enjoyable occasion, not everyone feels the same.\n\n[ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')], for instance, have traditionally been critics of what they see as a heathen holiday, a relic of the dark past we should be rid of, for it clouds our judgment and insults [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName].\n\nNot everyone pays attention to these killjoys, but [chaplain.GetCouncilTitle] [chaplain.GetTitledFirstName] has been particularly vocal about [chaplain.GetHerHis] disapproval of the festivities lately."
 yule.0025.a: "Order [chaplain.GetHerHim] to not take things so seriously"
 yule.0025.b: "Tell [chaplain.GetHerHim] I'll tone it down in the future"
 yule.0026.t: "Under Heathen Rule"
 yule.0026.desc: "Despite how merry #italic Kalends#! can be, it is also an important religious occasion – at least for devout [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdherentNamePlural] like us living under the rule of a certain [liege.GetFaith.GetAdjective] [liege.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] like [liege.GetFirstName], for example.\n\nIt is through this festive occasion that we can reinforce our dedication to our ancient beliefs and customs, and no one, not even [liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] can wrestle away the pride we feel when we celebrate #italic Kalends#!. Thus, I have made time to go to a local [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HouseOfWorship] to offer prayers to [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] today in between the festivities."
 yule.0026.a: "We are dutiful [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdherentNamePluralNoTooltip], even during #italic Kalends#!."
 yule.0027.t: "Feasting and Drinking"
 yule.0027.desc: "A big part of the #italic Kalends#! is all the feasting and drinking! This year is no different, and my servants have put together a splendid, fabulous meal consisting of all manner of [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetName] culinary delights!\n\nIn all honesty, sometimes, there are those who look forward more to the feasting than the rest of this holiday."
 yule.0027.a: "I don’t blame them! Dig in, everyone!"
 yule.0027.b: "Though it’s a holiday, I won’t overdo it."
 yule.0028.t: "The Masquerade"
 yule.0028.desc: "We hear a loud ruckus outside, and take a look to see what’s going on. It turns out to be a throng of revelers putting on a masquerade, with some men dressed as women, some women dressed as men, and some others dressed as animals.\n\nNot everyone in this group appears to be dressed up, but they look like they’re having a lot of fun."
 yule.0028.a: "Hey, why don’t we join in their little parade?"
 yule.0028.b: "I want to dress up as something daring!"
 yule.0028.c: "We can observe the masquerade from here."
 yule.0029.t: "Children's Carols"
 yule.0029.desc: "The voice of children singing carols outside is unmistakable. “Kalends! Kalends!” they sing, like a mesmerizing chant.\n\nWhenever such children come around, it is important that we give them some sweets or a bit of gold, for such is the old custom during #italic Kalends#!.\n\nMy servants open the door, and the dulcet voices of the youngsters fill our ears. Once the singing is over, my servants look to me to give them permission to give the children the sweets and money."
 yule.0029.a: "Go ahead and give candy to the little ones." 
 yule.0029.b: "These lovely children deserve a large gift!" 
 yule.0029.c: "We don’t run a charity here – farewell, kids!" 
 yule.0030.t: "Overdoing It"
 yule.0030.desc: "It is not unexpected for people to consume a bit too much during #italic [activity.Custom( 'YuleName' )]#!.\n\n[eater.GetTitledFirstName], alas, has fallen victim to this problem. During the holiday banquet, [eater.GetSheHe] ate and drank way too much.\n\nHowever, [eater.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] doesn’t want to miss out on the rest of the celebrations!"
 yule.0030.a: "You should get some rest, [eater.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]."
 yule.0031.t: "Contemplations"
 yule.0031.desc: "Gift-giving is an important part of #italic Kalends#!, but this also means there is a lot of discussion about it.\n\nThat is, some people say there isn’t enough gift-giving, and this is making the holiday worse. Others say there is too much gift-giving, and that this is also ruining the holiday. Yet others are worried about whether they will receive adequate gifts from others."
 yule.0031.a: "It is not the gift but the thought that counts!"
 yule.0031.b: "People need to take gift-giving more seriously."
 yule.0032.t: "Partying"
 yule.0032.desc: "We decided to go into town during #italic Kalends#!. Why? For the partying, of course!\n\nLarge throngs of people have gathered to make merry, and the air is full of excitement and energy. Sure, things might get a little rowdy, but it’s all in good fun!"
 yule.0032.a: "I better join in partying with everyone."
 yule.0032.b: "I’ll just observe from a distance."
 yule.0033.t: "Mixing of Classes"
 yule.0033.desc: "Feasting during #italic Kalends#! is a given, but one thing that sets these feasts apart from other feasts held during the year is that servants and slaves will join their masters and mistresses in the feasting, as if they were equals.\n\nDining together with one’s lessers is not the most unpleasant experience for some, as they get to know their servants and slaves better in the spirit of charity. Yet others dislike such a thing, not wanting to mingle with such lowly types."
 yule.0033.a: "It’s a fun and thoughtful practice."
 yule.0033.b: "I don’t like having to dine with my lessers."
 yule.0034.t: "Foreigners"
 yule.0034.desc: "I know of some foreign merchants and travelers staying nearby. Though their people do not traditionally celebrate #italic Kalends#!, it is not uncommon for us to invite these foreigners to join us in their celebrations.\n\nSome outsiders see the holiday as an offensive, vulgar occasion, warning their kind to stay away from our “inappropriate” celebrations and revelry. Others, however, don’t mind taking part in the festivities.\n\nPerhaps I should invite the foreigners to join us?"
 yule.0034.a: "Of course. The more the merrier!"
 yule.0034.b: "They probably wouldn’t be interested."
