 faith_arienism_adj:0 "Arienism"
 faith_arienism_adherent:0 "Arienist"
 faith_arienism_adherent_plural:0 "Arienists"
 faith_arienism_desc:0 "The cult of Arien, known also as the cult of Arien-Āzië, is a reformed variant of the traditional solar-worship of Khy. Whereas traditional Azianic practice places primacy first and foremost on overcoming the darkness within oneself and then teaching others, Arienism far more forcefully expounds the need to strive against the darkness in the larger world.\n\nMuch as the light of the sun illuminates the whole world, it is the duty of the faithful not just to overcome their own inner darkness and that in their community, but to aggressively seek out the darkness wherever it should hide. Note that this is not a dogmatic demand that all become Arienists - indeed, the Arienist creed recognizes many 'righteous practices' among the peoples of the world. But for unrighteous practices, the Arien creed demands that the faithful blaze with righteous and zealous light, dismantling and destroying the corruption of darkness wherever they should find it." #Established by the Blue Wizards, the Cult of Arien was built upon existing solar worship within Khy, to provide unity and stability. Dominant in highly populated areas around Khy’s central river.

 faith_azianic:0 "Azianic" # Traditional faith of Khy, as established by Azmaran the Sage in the early second age
 faith_azianic_adj:0 "Azianic"
 faith_azianic_adherent:0 "Azianite"
 faith_azianic_adherent_plural:0 "Azianites"
 faith_azianic_desc:0 "The worship of the sun-goddess Āzië established in ancient days by Azmaran the Sage, the Azianite faithful lift their praises to the sun, guardian and mother to mankind.\n\nAzianites hold that the sun is the last source of untainted Light, where all human souls come from and must return to. But the physical world is marred by shadow, and this stain is upon even the soul - only those who master themselves and resist the sins of the world may take the path to the origin of all. Yet not all who do so forsake the world, but instead chose to remain, or return even, and be born anew, to guide others in the ways of righteousness. Until the day when darkness and despair are no more, and the light of the human heart outshines every shadow."

 # Tîlanik, Moon-Cult

 faith_tilanik:0 "Example of Tîlanik"
 faith_tilanik_adj:0 "Tîlanism"
 faith_tilanik_adherent:0 "Tîlanite"
 faith_tilanik_adherent_plural:0 "Tîlanites"
 faith_tilanik_desc:0 "Compared to his twin sister, Tîlanik's light is a lesser one, insufficient to fully banish the darkness of the world. But this is not a source of shame, the faithful say.\n\nFor Tîlanik marred himself for love of his sister, taking the ruinous blows of the Dark when it tried to disrupt the Ascension of Dawn. If it had succeeded, it may have destroyed both dieties, as well as the scattered primordial light they had so painstakingly rescued from the ends of the earth, while the other gods made war on the Dark. Seeing the threat at the last, Tîlanik hastily rose, and threw himself between his sister and the full force of the Dark, holding it at bay for six days. On the seventh, his sister rose, born anew in the Light Undiminished, and her wroth set the dark to flight. But Tîlanik's sacrifice had come at great cost - his own light diminished and form scarred. Thus his light became pale silver to his sister's glorious gold, and he lacked the power she had. But he remains steadfast in his duty despite his comparable weakness, wandering the sky even when his sister must rest.\n\nThe followers of Tîlanik thus preach a message of discipline, self-sacrifice, good-works, and charity. After all, if a God could sacrifice much for the good of others, then surely Men can sacrifice but a little?"

 # Numenorean-influenced (ye olde days, anyway) Earendil/Morningstar cult

 faith_iarandel_adj:0 "Iarandelic"
 faith_iarandel_adherent:0 "Iarandelian"
 faith_iarandel_adherent_plural:0 "Iarandelians"
 faith_iarandel_desc:0 "Though the worship of the sun and moon, Azië and Tîlanik, has long stood above all others in Khy, they are not the only gods held in reverence, nor indeed the only lights of this world.\n\nFor when the sun and moon are absent, and darkness blankets all, the stars endure. And greatest of these is the light of the Morningstar, remembered in ancient tongue as Iarandel. Herald and guard of Azië, Iarandel once was a mortal man, though bearing the blood of the undying. From him came a great king of men, and a manifold many peoples.\n\nFor love of them he risked death and doom alike, leaving behind his sons, braving deepest darkness to ransom the chained stars to the gods. For his sacrifice he transcended as all Men seek, but at the precipice he turned back. He took his place among the stars, forsaking his return to the primordial light, that there may be a beacon of guidance even in the hours of deepest darkness.”
