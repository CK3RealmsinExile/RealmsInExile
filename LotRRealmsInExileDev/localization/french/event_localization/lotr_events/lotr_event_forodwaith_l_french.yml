###   Restore the Iron Crown of Angmar
 forodwaith.0001.t:0 "The Heir of Angmar"
 forodwaith.0001.desc:0 "Long-fallen [angmar|E] rises anew. For centuries, the wastes of the north lay uninhabited, the ruins of this long-lost realm. Once, it was among the greatest and mightiest realms of [middleearth|E] under the rule of the [witchkingshort|E]. It laid waste to [GetTitleByKey('e_arnor').GetNameNoTier] and its successor states, destroying that wretched kingdom of the [dunedain|E] and striking fear into the hearts of men. Yet it too would fall against a combined onslaught of [conceptracemen|E] and [elves|E] which would leave the region utterly uninhabited.\n\nYet no more! Under my rule, the Realm of [GetTitleByKey('k_angmar').GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] rises again. The northern wastes and ruins of the former kingdom have been resettled, and it is in my name that the memory of [theironcrown|E] of [GetTitleByKey('k_angmar').GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] is renewed."
 forodwaith.0001.a:0 "Let the north tremble, for I am the heir of the Iron Crown!"
