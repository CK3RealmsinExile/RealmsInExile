 gundabad.0200.t:0 "Revitalisation of the Orcs"
 gundabad.0200.desc:0 "For far too long, the Orcs of the North have forgotten their past. They wander about not different with wild dogs, only to be helplessly slaughtered by the men that have grown in strength since the mishap at Dale! Guided by the great Ulûkai and the blood of Azog that grants [ROOT.Char.GetHerHim] great power and wit so desperately needed, [ROOT.Char.GetFirstNameRegnal] has once again cemented Orcish supremacy in the Anduin Vale.\n\nNow that we finally established secure control over the various bridges and fords across the Anduin, the wrath of Mount Gundabad will be felt by all throughout the North. Already warg riders are scouting for potential targets. May our raids swiftly befall any who dare to oppose us, men or elves!"
 gundabad.0200.a:0 "Great terror shall ride forth from Gundabad once more!"

 gundabad.0201.t:0 "Master of The North"  #Not used
 gundabad.0201.desc:0 "Bolg's folly was more than avenged when the Orc horde overran not only the Mannish kingdom of Dale, but also laid waste to the damned Greenwood. Now truly broken, the vile Men and Elves are on the run, their strongest fortifications laid low by our great trolls, their people scattered to be the prey of wild beasts and warg riders, and their riches emptied all for the lord of Gundabad. With this newfound wealth, our boys could certainly use some fresh meat instead of maggoty bread, amongst other things.\n\nNow that the Tarks will be without any assistance from the North, the eventual assault on Minas Tirith seems all the more imminent. Let them tremble in fear, for their inevitable doom is coming!"
 gundabad.0201.a:0 "Our lordship over these lands shall ensure for a hundred generations!"

 gundabad.0202.t:0 "Ignite the Forges of [GetTitleByKey('d_gundabad').GetNameNoTier]"
 gundabad.0202.desc:0 "The mountain thunders with the meeting of hammer and anvil. The forges of the [dwarves|e], which have lay dormant for countless years, awaken.\n\nDeep under they labor day and night, producing war materials worthy of my army. As I walk through the forges, I see weapons and armor fit for war-trolls piling up, sharp blades glinting in torchlight and broad shields and breastplates emblazoned with my sigils.\n\nThe ignited Dwarven forges of Gundabad have now made it possible to produce stronger and more durable steel, suitable for my trolls and the fiercest of the warriors of Gundabad."
 gundabad.0202.a:0 "No army will be able to stand against me now!"

 gundabad.1001.t:0 "A Question of Leadership"
 gundabad.1001.desc:0 "My decisive show of strength has finally brought the northern reaches of the Anduin Vale under my control, but already the local menfolk grow restless and are beginning to resist their rightful overlords. The war-hungry warriors of my host are eager to tear the heart out of this foolish resistance just as it starts beating, relishing the prospect of plunder and bloodshed that it would bring.\n\nYet there are some among the menfolk that are weak, cowardly and corruptable, who may be able to keep their people in line if given the chance to rule over them."
 gundabad.1001.a:0 "Give them control over what land I have taken."
 gundabad.1001.b:0 "Let them have it all, I need my best for the wars ahead!"
 gundabad.1001.c:0 "There is no place left in this world for men!"
 gundabad.1001.d:0 "I don't have time for this..."
 gundabad.1001.a.effect:0 "Grant all non-[colony|E] [counties|E] held by you in [GetTitleByKey('k_langwell').GetNameNoTier] to local [culture|E] [THIS.Char.GetFaith.GetName] followers."
 gundabad.1001.b.effect:0 "Replace all non-[colony|E] [counties|E] held by non-local [cultures|E] [vassals|E] in [GetTitleByKey('k_langwell').GetNameNoTier] with local [culture|E] [THIS.Char.GetFaith.GetName] followers."
 gundabad.1001.c.effect1:0 "Revoke all [counties|E] held by non-[orc|E] [vassals|E] in [GetTitleByKey('k_langwell').GetNameNoTier]."
 gundabad.1001.c.effect2:0 "All non-[this_char.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip] [culture|E] [counties|E] gain [GetModifier( 'gundabad_ravaged_lands_county_modifier' ).GetNameWithTooltip] for 10 years."
 gundabad.1001.c.effect3:0 "65% chance of non-[this_char.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip] [culture|E] [counties|E] converting to your [culture|E] and [faith|E]."

 gundabad.1011.t:0 "A Dragon's Durability"
 gundabad.1011.desc:0 "During the campaigns to bring the dragon-worshippers of the Grey Mountains under my dominion, many battles were fought and much plunder was had. Ancient banners, rusted weapons aplenty, and not insignificant amounts of silver and gold were found.\n\nYet it is only now that the campaign is ending that we have found a prize truly worthy of my magnificence. While my lackeys were searching through the ancient holds, trying to sniff out any last stragglers, they uncovered an old abandoned warren. While initially deemed of little worth, in its depths was discovered a dragon-shrine. On the alter was laid a great armor, wrought of the shed scales of many [dragons|E], of many brilliant hues.\n\nWhat is this if not a sign that I am destined for true greatness? Another symbol of my great power!"
 gundabad.1011.a:0 "I am the dragon who rules these mountains now!"
 artifact_dragon_armour:0 "Dragonscale Armour"
 artifact_dragon_armour_desc:0 "Wrought by reverent goblin-smiths, this rough yet effective scale mail is made out of shed dragon scales. These scales are hard yet flexible, capable of withstanding blows as well as, or even better than, comparable metal armor. Additionally, it is much lighter than such armor, though obviously far more risky to produce. As such, it is a heavily prized heirloom of the orc or goblins who possess it."
 gundabad.1011.toast.title:0 "You have gained a loyal follower"

 gundabad.1015.t:0 "Lord of the Misty Mountains"
 gundabad.1015.desc:0 "Ever since the slaying of Bolg at the hands of Beorn during the Battle of the Five Armies, the orcs and goblins of the Misty Mountains have been in utter disarray. Without a centralizing force or leader, there has been not a shred of unity, with countless tribes and clans warring against each other.\n\nYet the tribes of the Misty Mountains were weak, and I have done might have seemed impossible to those of weaker wills. Once again every goblin and orc fights under one banner alone, as they did under Azog and Bolg; and that banner is mine!"
 gundabad.1015.a:0 "None remaining may challenge my control over these Mountains!"

 gundabad.1016.t:0 "Master of the North"
 gundabad.1016.desc:0 "Where once my forefathers failed, I have succeeded! Where once the armies of [gundabad|E] were vanquished, now they are the victors! Where once the combined forces of the [dwarves|e], [elves|E], and [conceptracemen|E] stood triumphantly, now they are #italic nothing#!.\n\nPrideful [dale|E], rebuilt after Smaug's killing, is once again debased; its name to be soon forgotten and the [northmen|E] once more humiliated.\n\nLikewise was the mightiest realm of the accursed Dwarves broken utterly, and the vast halls of [erebor|E] ran red with Dwarven blood. No longer could the great gates of the [lonelymountain|E] stand against my vengeance and wrath, and the riches of the Dwarves were again ours.\n\nAnd for the wicked [elves|E], ancient enemies of our kind, we repaid them in full. For long they have refused to face us fairly, cowering within their wretched forests like weaklings! Now their forests lay bare, and their homes and halls burn!\n\nSo have all slights against my forefathers been avenged utterly, and I stand now as the undisputed Master of the North!"
 gundabad.1016.a:0 "Where Azog and Bolg failed, I have succeeded."
