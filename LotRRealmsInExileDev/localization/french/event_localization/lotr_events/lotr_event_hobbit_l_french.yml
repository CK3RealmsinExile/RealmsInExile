 ### Decision-based events ###
 hobbit.0100.t:0 "Integrate [GetTitleByKey('c_dunglan').GetNameNoTier]"
 hobbit.0100.desc:0 "For long years the we Hobbits were content to live with the ancient borders granted to us by the old King at Norbury. But even in the slow-moving Shire things change, and we have begun to feel constrained within the bounds of the old Farthings. Some of the younger hobbits have even begun to feel adventurous, especially those without land of their own to till, and have begun drifting west into the fertile country west of the White Downs.\n\nArmed with ploughs and spades they have cleared fields and dug new homes in the hillsides, watched over by the White Towers which, they say, bring them luck. But Hobbits love formality and good order, and petitions have been drawn up calling for this [GetTitleByKey('c_dunglan').GetNameNoTier] to be officially added to the Shire. Now the authority of Thane and Mayor will stretch into this new Farthing… even if in reality everyone will carry on with their own business much as before."
 hobbit.0100.a:0 "For the Westmarch!"

 hobbit.0101.t:0 "Integrate [GetTitleByKey('c_buckland').GetNameNoTier]"
 hobbit.0101.desc:0 "[GetTitleByKey('c_buckland').GetNameNoTier] has always been a strange anomaly, an independent Hobbit-realm outside the ancient Shire borders granted by the King. This has sometimes created difficulties of law and trade, with neither the Thane nor the Mayor always being able to exert their rights over the Brandybuck’s strong-willed folk. But times have changed, and it is now accepted that [GetTitleByKey('c_buckland').GetNameNoTier] is, and shall ever be, part of the Shire.\n\nAll that needs to be done is for the papers to be drawn up, sealed and filed away in the archive at Michel Delving, after which everyone can congratulate themselves on a hard days work and retire to the pub for a celebratory feast, with much quaffing of ale. Tomorrow there’s every chance that everyone will have forgotten that anything was ever any different."
 hobbit.0101.a:0 "Finally reunited."

 hobbit.200.t:0 "An Unthinkable Discovery"
 hobbit.200.desc:0 "As I peruse the books further to the back of my library, a green tome catches my eye. It is looks quite ancient, and a thin layer of dust obscures its title. As I pick it up and wipe away the dust, I manage to read the faded golden letters:\n\n"ON THE MALADIES OF SECOND BREAKFAST"\n\nThe title is shocking, yet I am compelled to read. Its meaning soon becomes obvious. In it the author suggests skipping various meals; limiting oneself to only three big meals a day.\n\nHow this book came into my collection I do not know; it is clearly old, and the lettering is faded. Its ideas are very odd, and to many, unthinkable!"
 hobbit.200.a:0 "I think i'll just put this back."
 hobbit.200.b:0 "I'll toss this preposterous book into the fire, where it belongs!"
 hobbit.200.c:0 "I could stand to lose a little weight..."
 hobbit.200.c.success.critical:0 "Skipping meals does wonders for you"
 hobbit.200.c.success:0 "You feel slightly better, but its nothing major"
 hobbit.200.c.failure:0 "You are left hungry and tired"
 hobbit.200.c.failure.critical:0 "The drastic change has left you much worse than before"
 hobbit.200.d:0 "This is revolutionary! I must convince my court of the merits of this idea!"
 hobbit.200.d.tt:0 "This will definitely, most certainly not work"
