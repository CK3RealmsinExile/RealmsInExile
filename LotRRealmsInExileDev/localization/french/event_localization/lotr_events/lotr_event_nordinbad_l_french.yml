 decision_nordinbad_contact_erebor_tooltip:0 "Attempt to restore relations with our rightful liege"
 decision_nordinbad_contact_erebor_desc:0 "The Grey Mountains are not a realm for the faint of heart, with all the [drakes|E] and [goblins|E] infesting it now. That was why most of our [longbeard|E] kin fled south to the [lonelymountain|E]. We however, were unwilling to leave Azan-zâram, and by our lack of material wealth, we managed to avoid the wrath of the [dragons|E]. But now the Great Drakes are gone, and [GetTitleByKey('k_erebor').GetNameNoTier|U] still stands while we remain alone in the Ered Mithrin. The house of Gorin has always sworn true fealty to Erebor, and with our newfound access to the surface, perhaps we can contact our long lost kin?"
 decision_nordinbad_contact_erebor_confirm:0 "Call the Emissary"

 nordinbad.0100.title:0 "Abandoning Isolation?" 
 nordinbad.0100.desc:0 "It doesn't take long for the emissary to arrive before me and present himself. Our years of isolation it seemed were coming to an end as the hopes of [GetTitleByKey('c_nordinbad').GetNameNoTier|U] rested on the shoulders of this emissary. It had been so long since we had any contact with our cousins in [erebor|E] and the Iron Hills that we wonder what tales they might have for us from the [lonelymountain|E].\n\nStill, there are some doubts. While we have always claimed to swear fealty to the House of [durin|E], in practice we have not for hundreds of years now. Some question whether we really should ask for help when we know that the cost will be a renewal of those Oaths of fealty. As lord of Nordinbad, the decision ultimately falls to me, and with the emissary now before me, it is time to choose."
 nordinbad.0100.a:0 "Send the Emissary"
 nordinbad.0100.b:0 "Dismiss the Emissary"
 nordinbad.0100.tt:0 "A messenger will be sent to [GetTitleByKey('k_erebor').GetNameNoTier|U], and we shall have to await their response."
 
 nordinbad.0101.title:0 "An Emissary From Long Lost Kin"
 nordinbad.0101.desc:0 "There was a strange occurrence in court today. A [dwarf|E] bearing strange heritage approaches and gives the proper honors, before relaying his message. He has come from the Ered Mithrin, where he represents the long lost [longbeard|E] hold of [GetTitleByKey('c_nordinbad').GetNameNoTier|U]. This causes some pause amongst the chatter at court as many believed the House of Gorin to have fallen long ago to [drakes|E] and [goblins|E].\n\nThe emissary continues, stating that Nordinbad has finally regained access to the surface, and is requesting assistance in their quest to reclaim the Ered Mithrin.\n\nThe House of Gorin has sworn fealty to the House of [durin|E] for centuries now, and so I am left with the question of whether I should offer assistance in return for a renewal of this Oath, or if I can really afford to spare the assistance?"
 nordinbad.0101.a:0 "We shall aid our beleagured kin"
 nordinbad.0101.b:0 "Unfortunately, we cannot provide aid at this time"
 
 nordinbad.0102.title:0 "Erebor Sends Aid"
 nordinbad.0102.desc:0 "These past few weeks have had me sitting at the edge of my seat as I wait for the emissary to return from [erebor|E]. My imagination is running wild with ideas on what could have happened to them and why they might not have returned. Each day I question if I should send another, yet each day I convince myself to just wait a little while longer.\n\nAnd finally my patience is given an answer as my emissary finally returns. I can't guess the outcome of his quest by his expression, as he seemed to be worn out from his journey. But soon enough I'm given the answer. [GetTitleByKey('k_erebor').GetNameNoTier|U] is willing to assist us in our reclamation, so long as we offer an Oath to swear fealty upon the completion of our quest. When we accept, a small army of warriors from Erebor would immediately come to assist us with our endeavor."
 nordinbad.0102.a:0 "Then it is an Oath that we shall swear"
 
 nordinbad.0103.title:0 "Erebor Refuses Aid"
 nordinbad.0103.desc:0 "These past few weeks have had me sitting at the edge of my seat as I wait for the emissary to return from [erebor|E]. My imagination is running wild with ideas on what could have happened to them and why they might not have returned. Each day I question if I should send another, yet each day I convince myself to just wait a little while longer.\n\nAnd finally my patience is given an answer as my emissary finally returns. Though from the look on his face, I already know what he was about to say. [GetTitleByKey('k_erebor').GetNameNoTier|U] has refused to offer us any aid, and given us their most sincere apologies. Unfortunately, their apologies won't help us restore the Ered Mithrin." 
 nordinbad.0103.a:0 "We'll have to do this the hard way"
 
 nordinbad.0200.title:0 "Steady Progress"
 nordinbad.0200.desc:0 "With my recent conquests I have claimed a sizable portion of the Ered Mithrin, and in no small part thanks to the previous assistance sent by [erebor|E]. However progress has been slower than I had initially hoped, and I feel we are just on the verge of being able to grasp the final portion of the mountains. With just a few more soldiers from [GetTitleByKey('k_erebor').GetNameNoTier|U] we'll be able to finally cleanse the Goblin filth from the mountains once and for all, and we'll be able to keep our Oath. When they hear about our progress so far, they are sure to support our further endeavors."
 nordinbad.0200.a:0 "Surely they'll be happy to hear this"
 
 nordinbad.0201.title:0 "A Report from the Grey Mountains"
 nordinbad.0201.desc:0 "Another Emissary has come from the North, this time to report on the progress of the [GetTitleByKey('c_nordinbad').GetNameNoTier|U] [dwarves|E]. Apparently, all has been going very well for our kin, and they have made significant progress in claiming a sizable protion of the Ered Mithrin. We're quick to congratulate the emissary on the progress being made, but then he makes his next request.\n\nHe is asking me for another expedition so that they might speed up the process and bring our people together again in a more timely manner. It's not surprising that they are asking for additional aid, yet their Oath has already been made, so I am under no obligation to provide any further support. Though should I withold another expedition, their progress is likely to slow considerably."
 nordinbad.0201.a:0 "We can spare more men"
 nordinbad.0201.b:0 "Unfortunately we can spare no more"
 
 nordinbad.0202.title:0 "Erebor Sends More Soldiers"
 nordinbad.0202.desc:0 "My emissary has once again returned from [erebor|E], and like before he is not alone. Behind him is a small army of some of the greatest warriors that Erebor has to offer, and a pledge of support from the King of [GetTitleByKey('k_erebor').GetNameNoTier|U] for my claim on the Grey Mountains. This second expedition is twice the size of the first, and far better equiped. It seems my success so far has embolded Erebor, and verified the efficacy of our plans.\n\nOf course with this gift there are obvious reminders of our Oath in the message delivered, but with the continued support from Erebor I should have everything I need to finish my work here."
 nordinbad.0202.a:0 "Send our gratitude to the King Under the Mountain!"
 
 nordinbad.0203.title:0 "Erebor Showers Us With Honors"
 nordinbad.0203.desc:0 "My emissary has once again returned from [erebor|E]. I hold back my excitement at the potential for further aid, and receive his news. The King of [GetTitleByKey('k_erebor').GetNameNoTier|U] has acknowledged that the Grey Mountains are to be our domain, overseen by the House of Gorin until the end of days so long as we keep to our Oath. While this confirmation is good news, I am quite to inquire with my emissary about further military assistance.\n\nUnfortunately, the King Under the Mountain has declined to provide us with additional soldiers. Disappointment washes over me as I sit back and let out a sigh. Erebor is unable to send soldiers on account of their own financial and military difficulties. This would certainly slow my efforts in reuniting the Ered Mithrin."
 nordinbad.0203.a:0 "Unfortunate, but we shall carry on"
 
 nordinbad.0300.title:0 "Erebor Demands We Keep Our Oath"
 nordinbad.0300.desc:0 "It's taken us years and the lives of many of our kin, but through steel and determination the [dwarves|E] of [GetTitleByKey('c_nordinbad').GetNameNoTier|U] have finally reclaimed the Grey Mountains. Already our King is holding a feast to celebrate our victory. The sounds of revelry and pride fill the halls for a time, before it quiets down as the emissary from [erebor|E] approaches the King.\n\nThe emissary starts by congratulating us on our success in driving the [goblins|E] from the mountains, but it quickly turns toward reminding me of the Oath that was made to the King Under the Mountain. I knew that this Oath would make this moment all but inevitable, and my people look to me expectantly, knowing that their honorable King would keep to the Oath sworn all those years ago. "
 nordinbad.0300.a:0 "On second thought..."
 nordinbad.0300.b:0 "We keep our oaths"
 nordinbad.0300.tt:0 "Erebor will almost certainly try to take our land by force"
 
 nordinbad.0301.title:0 "Erebor Demands Submission"
 nordinbad.0301.desc:0 "It's taken us years and the lives of many of our kin, but through steel and determination the [dwarves|E] of [GetTitleByKey('c_nordinbad').GetNameNoTier|U] have finally reclaimed the Grey Mountains.

The sounds of revelry and pride fill the halls for a time, before it quiets down as the emissary from [erebor|E] approaches the King.\n\nThe emissary starts by congratulating us on our success in driving the [goblins|E] from the mountains, but the emissary reminds us of our ancient vows of fealty to the House of [durin|E], and requests that once again, we swear an oath of fealty."
 nordinbad.0301.a:0 "We took this ourselves, we shall hold it ourselves"
 nordinbad.0301.b:0 "We have always sworn fealty to the line of Durin"
 
 nordinbad.0302.title:0 "The Grey Mountains Join the Fold!"
 nordinbad.0302.desc:0 "My emissary sent to the [dwarves|E] of [GetTitleByKey('c_nordinbad').GetNameNoTier|U] has returned to [erebor|E] with word that the House of Gorin has fulfilled their oath, and that they have sworn fealty to the King Under the Mountain in perpetuity. After the centuries of being apart, the [longbeards|E] are united once again.\n\nWith this the north is finally secured for children of [durin|E], and we can begin the long process of rebuilding what was lost."
 nordinbad.0302.a:0 "Finally reunited with our kin"
 
 nordinbad.0303.title:0 "Spurned by the Grey Mountains"
 nordinbad.0303.desc:0 "I wait eagerly in my hall for the news of the Grey Mountains. It wasn't so long ago that I had sent out my emissary to demand that the House of Gorin renew it's ancient vow of fealty to the House of [durin|E]. Finally the [longbeards|E] of the north would be united once again.\n\nSoon enough I can see my emissary walking down the hall towards me. He gives the proper honors before he tells me the terrible truth of what happened in the Ered Mithrin. After succesfully cleansing the mountains of Goblin filth, the House of Gorin has refused to renew their fealty.\n\nDo Oaths mean nothing to these [dwarves|E]? To abandon their vows and ignore their histories so easily was an outrage. I grind my teeth in anger, looking down at my emissary before I say..."
 nordinbad.0303.a:0 "Oathbreakers! We'll show you what happens when you break faith!"
 nordinbad.0303.b:0 "We will bide our time and punish these traitors soon"
 nordinbad.0303.c:0 "They only weaken us by by keeping us divided"
 
 nordinbad.0400.title:0 "Our Conquest of the Grey Mountains"
 nordinbad.0400.desc:0 "With the [goblins|E] driven from [GetTitleByKey('d_thakalgund').GetNameNoTier|U], our soldiers can breathe a sigh of relief. While many may still be hiding within the caves of the Ered Mithrin, their primary stronghold in the Grey Mountains has been cleansed and reclaimed by the House of [durin|E]. Though with the rest of the mountain range sure to fall in short order I'm left with a conundrum.\n\nI had made a deal with the [dwarves|E] of [GetTitleByKey('c_nordinbad').GetNameNoTier|U], the House of Gorin. In return for fealty they would have assistance with reclaiming the Ered Mithrin. With Thakalgund now in my posession the terms of our deal would require me to hand it over to them, though I would be able to demand their immediate fealty."
 nordinbad.0400.a:0 "Send word to Nordinbad"
 
 nordinbad.0401.title:0 "Erebor Takes Thakalgund"
 nordinbad.0401.desc:0 "It seems I had been beaten to the punch by the [dwarves|E] of [erebor|E]. Despite the Oath we swore to them that required us to swear fealty in return for assistance in reclaiming the Grey Mountains, it seems that [GetTitleByKey('k_erebor').GetNameNoTier|U] took it upon itself to reclaim [GetTitleByKey('d_thakalgund').GetNameNoTier|U], the greatest hold in the Ered Mithrin themselves. This would go against the deal we had made that we would rule the mountains in their name, and already frustration has been brewing at court.\n\nThat frustration is short lived though, as the emissary from Erebor arrives in our halls, proclaiming that Erebor's assistance in reclaiming the Ered Mithrin has been great, and the King Under the Mountain is ready to immediately turn over Thakalgund and name us Lord of the Grey Mountains in return for our promised oath of Fealty."
