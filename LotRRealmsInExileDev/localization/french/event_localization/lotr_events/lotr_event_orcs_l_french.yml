Join the ranks of the Berserkers.\n\nThe road will be hard, and terrible stories are told about the deadly training, and that only a few manage to complete it successfully..."

 orcs.3001.a.tt:0 "The training begins!"

 orcs.3003.t:0 "Doubts in the Night"
 orcs.3003.desc:0 "It's been a year since my training started. A year of death and pain, anger and hatred. My senses have been sharpened. My resistance to pain has multiplied.\n\nI am no longer the same. I dream of the smell of blood and each life I reap brings me closer to ecstasy. But in my dark cell, during the hours of sleep, I ask myself: Is this what I want?"
 orcs.3003.a:0 "The blood is calling me, there is no turning back."
 orcs.3003.a.tt:0 "You continue with the training."

But when we get to the farthest cell, I discover a familiar face...\n\n[myfam.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip], my [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMeShort', SCOPE.sC('myfam'))], is hanging between the ruinous chains. A dirty, bloodstained rag covers [myfam.GetHerHis] eyes.\n\nThe coach's voice echoes through the tunnels while removing the blindfold: “Show me your purpose... Feast on [wounded_courtier.GetHerHis] blood.”"
 orcs.3004.a:0 "DIE! DIE! DIE!"
 orcs.3004.a.tt:0 "You end [myfam.GetHerHis] life."
 orcs.3004.b:0 "How dare you? Release my [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMeShort', SCOPE.sC('myfam'))] immediately!"
 orcs.3004.b.tt:0 "You make your coach angry, and he may do what you cannot. Then, you leave the way of the Berserker."
 orcs.3004.c:0 "No, I will feast on YOUR blood."
 orcs.3004.c.tt:0 "Attack your trainer, release the prisoner and leave the way of the Berserker."

 orcs.3005.t:0 "The Rise of the Berserker"
 orcs.3005.desc:0 "Today I got rid of all my ties. I have shown everyone my full commitment to the cause and fervent devotion to [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetFaith.HighGodName].\n\nWhen my helmet is put on, I feel the blood of my enemies spilling over my head. His scent guides my will, his warmth fuels my anger.\n\n[ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] has died, and in his place a bringer of death rises. A Berserker Uruk-hai."
 orcs.3005.a:0 "RAAAAAAARGH!!!"
 orcs.3005.a.tt:0 "You have completed the path of the Berserker."
 
 ### An Orc Champion ###
 orcs.2001.t:0 "A Young Champion"
 orcs.2001.desc:0 "Rumours have reached me lately about a young orc wreaking havoc in the fighting pits. They also say that he is respected among the other fighters and that every day more and more orcs crowd to watch him fight.\n\nIt is undeniable that he must be an exceptional orc. And that's exactly what makes me worry.\n\nIs my leadership at stake? Maybe I should go see it myself..."
 orcs.2001.a:0 "I'll go see him."
 orcs.2001.a.tt:0 "You will be looking for the orc..."
 orcs.2001.b:0 "What does it matter, I doubt that he is a match for me."
 orcs.2001.b.tt:0 "You ignore him."

 orcs.2002.t:0 "A Young Champion"
 orcs.2002.desc:0 "It has not been difficult to track him down. My spies say that after fighting in the pit, this orc always goes to the same dump to drink grog with his companions.\n\nI go to the place, incognito, and there I find a huge group of Uruks and dirty Snagas cheering a name:\n\n#emphasis [strongorc.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip]!, [strongorc.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip]!, [strongorc.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip]! #!\n\nAt the top of the table, a powerful Uruk is striking another with the victim's own arm, brutally ripped off. After this bloody but entertaining show, [strongorc.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] heads to the barrel for more grog. Now is the time to get closer to him..."
 orcs.2002.a:0 "This orc is a show! I will try to earn his trust and loyalty."
 orcs.2002.a.tt:0 "You try to make friends with the champion in hopes that he will join you."
 orcs.2002.b:0 "I must buy his services. Show dominance and gain a powerful bodyguard."
 orcs.2002.b.tt:0 "You hire the champion as your personal bodyguard."
 orcs.2002.c:0 "He is a threat that I can't afford ... #emphasis "Let me fill your jug, mate. #!""
 orcs.2002.c.tt:0 "You try to poison the champion."
 orcs.2002.d:0 "Bah, it's not worth it."
 orcs.2002.d.tt:0 "You leave hoping that this has no major significance."

 orcs.2003.t:0 "A Loyal Champion"
 orcs.2003.desc:0 "After several nights of laughter and grog, [strongorc.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] and I have become inseparable.\n\nWhile I admire his might, he has found in me a figure of command, his natural leader.\n\nToday he has sworn his eternal loyalty to me and I will accept his services as his lord and friend."
 orcs.2003.a:0 "United, we will be unstoppable."
 orcs.2003.a.tt:0 "[strongorc.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] becomes your loyal bodyguard."

 orcs.2004.a.t:0 "Friendship Rejected"

 orcs.2005.t:0 "A New Enemy"
 orcs.2005.desc:0 "[strongorc.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] has seen me spreading the poison! Raising his voice in rage, soon the entire tavern knows, and a brawl breaks out as he tries to come after me! I manage to barely slink away in the chaos, leaving behind a lot of wasted grog, a rather humiliating incident, and a new foe. [strongorc.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] escaped his fate today, but he won't always be so luck..."

But [escaped_slave.GetSheHe] was not able to get very far before my trackers managed to hunt [escaped_slave.GetHerHim] down.\n\n What kind of message should I teach this maggot?"
 orcs.0014.a:0 "Put [escaped_slave.GetHerHim] in chains, I'll deal with [escaped_slave.GetHerHim] later"

Visions fill your head of the vast plunder that awaits you, of the destiny of the orc race to cover all the lands, to enslave and dominate all others! Soon your host will roll over the lands of men, and none will have a hope of standing against your might! \n\nWhat shall be your first target, I wonder? Sniveling tarks, cowardly elf-witches, or the sweet gold of the dwarven holds?"
 orcs.0020.a:0 "There will gold to grasp and grog to drink without end!"
