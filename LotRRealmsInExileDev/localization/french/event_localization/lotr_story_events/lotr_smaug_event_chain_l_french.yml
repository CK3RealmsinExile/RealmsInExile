 smaug_event_chain.0100.dwarf.desc:0 "Il fait nuit noire alors que je m'éveille en sursaut, réveillé[ROOT.Char.Custom('FR_E')] par les rumeurs du chaos et le son déchaîné des cloches du Val. D'autres nains courent à ma rencontre, leur visages pâles et me voilà aggripé[ROOT.Char.Custom('FR_E')] avant même de comprendre ce qui se passe. Au milieu des clameurs, je parviens à saisir un unique mot :\n\n#emp Dragon#!.\n\nJ'entends des cris lointains et faibles, mais ils sont facilement noyés par le sifflement hideux des flammes. Je me rue aux grandes fenêtres, choqué[ROOT.Char.Custom('FR_E')], et mon regard est alors rempli des fumées noires ondulantes et le feu rouge et mordant.\n\nIl consume tout. Tout. L'ombre de grandes ailes tombe sur moi. Je trébuche. Des écailles rouges et dorées emplissent mon champs de vision mais, avant que je ne puisse voir le [dragon|El] entier, je suis tiré[ROOT.Char.Custom('FR_E')] à l'écart par ma garde."

Nous, les orques, possédons une bonne vision de nuit, mais je n'en ai pas besoin : l'odeur arrive la première. La puanteur du bois carbonisé et de la chaire brûlée remplit mon nez, brûlant mes narines et me faisant larmoyer, me forçant à m'éloigner des murs. Mes soldats n'ont pas connu de bon pillage depuis des lustres. Qui peut donc... ?\n\nC'est alors que je le vois, malgré la brume qui emplit progressivement la vallée, s'élevant dans le ciel, dans la lumière de la lune. Et, bien que je n'ai jamais vu son pareil auparavant, d'une manière ou d'une autre je sais ce dont il s'agit, grâce à la mémoire d'âges de torture et de mort gravée dans mon corps. Je peux sentir mes yeux s'écarquiller de terreur avant que des nuages de cendre viennent les forcer à se fermer. Ma bouche s'anime d'elle-même et je crie :\n\n#emp Dragon#! Mes gardes du corps, aussi loyaux que peuvent l'être des orques, s'élancent et nous nous ruons vers la forteresse, nos longues jambes nous étant bien utiles dans cette course. Le son des cloches, les pleurs, et des cris de rage et de peur commencent à emplir l'air."
 smaug_event_chain.0100.desc:0 "Au début, je n'entends que le vent, mugissant dans cette nuit noir et douce, tel un ouragan qui descend progressivement du nord. Il me tire de mon repos et je m'aventure sur mon balcon pour en chercher la source. À chaque pas, mes yeux se referment, le sommeil me rappelant à lui. L'air semble particulièrement sec, cette nuit.\n\nAlors s'élève le son des cloches. Lourd, perçant la nuit, il me réveille immédiatement, comme su un torrent rugissant d'eau glacé se déversait sur ma peau. Mon regard tombe directement sur les gardes sur le murs et je peux voir qu'ils contemplent le ciel, le visage particulièrement pâle. Le vent hurlant s'intensifie et mon regard s'élève également.\n\nDans la lumière de la lune se déploie l'ombre d'une paire de grandes ailes noires et, avant même de pouvoir de crier de surprise, mes oreilles s'emplissent du sifflement hideux des flammes. Je suis immédiatement aggripé[ROOT.Char.Custom('FR_E')] par mes gardes et les cloches sonnent encore plus fort."

 smaug_event_chain.0101.dwarf.desc:0 "I feel the heat of the flame, and I see the shadow upon the floors, but I stand. The men, women, and children of [GetTitleByKey('k_erebor').GetNameNoTier] rush past me, but I heft my axe and stand. Fear and adrenaline course through my heart, and my retinue and I slowly step back.\n\nThe [dragon|E] roars, and fire fills the corridor fr ahead of me. Behind me is a secret exit, a back door, ever so close yet so far. Someone must hold off the dragon, if we are to escape.\n\nYet before I may even give an order, there is a roar in the hall. Not one of a dragon nor savage beast, but one of a company of Dwarves. Around me rush countless of them, armor shimmering in the light of fire and axes swinging with the fury of the sons of Durin, and they rush forth, eyes alight with rage.\n\nThey will not return. I gulp and turn, and as I close the door behind me, I hear their rageful screams. The wind moans in the night."
 smaug_event_chain.0101.elf.desc:0 "Elf desc"
 smaug_event_chain.0101.orc.desc:0 "The roar of flame is cut only by the lash of the whips, as my taskmasters get to work herding the few orcs who aren't allowed to pick up weapons out of our hold, pressing in their hands as much loot and supplies as they can carry. But rioters are everywhere, and me and my folk cut down an few unfortunate snagas who thought they could make the best of the situation. Quickly now, we make our way to the end of the orc-hold, surrounded by archers loosing poison-darts from bows of horn. But all the might of Orcish artillery is for naught - I watch in terror as the bolts bounce off the golden scales of the great beast, shimmering red in the light of the fire. In return, it sends a volley of flame, and stone and flesh chars as I hear my orcs scream. My heart is pounding, and we make for the exit quick-like, while the flame of the dragon roils and rumbles through the hold. I signal to my bodyguard, and they quickly hack off the legs of any of those too unfortunate to be at the back of the train.\n\nWe leave them for the dragon, while we fly like birds, our feathers fanned by a fiery breeze."
 smaug_event_chain.0101.desc:0 "Driven by the ringing of the bells I descend the flights of stairs, surrounded by my guards and family, and my heart races. Sweat drips down my forehead as I hear the screams of men and the roar of fire and destruction. Only when I am out once more can I finally see the situation.\n\nSmoke rises, thick and blacker than the sky, as the dragon swoops in once more. There is a twang of arrows as a volley fires in unison, but I can only watch in horror as they bounce off. Innocent people rush all around me, the sounds of their terror resounding in the night. At the piercing shrill of a horn charge forth warriors clad in armor, but within seconds they are ash before the dragon's ire. Towers collapse in booming explosions of brick and stone, houses are turned to rubble in seconds, and as my guards lead me from the city, I cannot muster a sound.\n\nThe bells ring in the dale."

Only as I stand, far from the desolation, do I finally take in the horror.\n\nThe valley is bathed in scarlet and gold, dreadful and bright and hideous, and black smoke smothers the stars. Upon the high hills are the black shapes of the trees, tall towers set aflame. Dale, the great city, is too consumed, for its rooves and houses burn, and its walls are laid bare, and its people huddle under the shadow of night.\n\nAnd last of all I look upon the [dragon|E], its shape visible as it flies against the moon. I clutch my axe, and for a moment I feel burning rage. Then, sorrow, and tiredness.\n\nThe bells ring still, faintly, so faintly."

I look upon my domain, and see the true breadth of the destruction.\n\nThe valley is bathed in scarlet and gold, dreadful and bright and hideous, and black smoke smothers the stars. Upon the high hills are the black shapes of the trees, tall towers set aflame. Dale, the great city, is too consumed, for its rooves and houses burn, and its walls are laid bare, and its people huddle under the shadow of night. So too is [erebor|E] consumed by flame and wreathed in smoke, the greatest home of the beardlings fallen. The gate is rent asunder, and dim lights, red and orange, dance within. The dragon has claimed its prize, though I wish it was mine, but more than Erebor I wish for the safety of my hold. I clench my hands and stamp my feet as I look upon the [dragon|E], that beast high above the clouds. Oh, how I wish I could throttle him! I clutch at my sword's hilt, rageful and frothing. But thoughs of vengeance gives way to tiredness. \n\nThe bells keep ringing, ever so faintly, just out of reach."

Only as I stand, far from the desolation, do I finally take in the horror.\n\nThe valley is bathed in scarlet and gold, dreadful and bright and hideous, and black smoke smothers the stars. The inhabitants of Dale, my very own people, huddle under the shadow of night, leaving the city in streams. Upon the high hills are the black shapes of the trees, like burnt matches. Mighty [erebor|E] is too consumed, the [lonelymountain|E] shrouded in smoke, its great gate rent asunder, its riches now certainly piled into a great bed for the dragon.\n\nFoul, wretched [dragon|E]. It sits atop the mountain's peak, black against the moon. At its very sight I grasp my sword's hilt, and for a moment I feel burning rage.

Should I join the other survivors and with head bowed and plead for help and aid from my Dwarf brethren, or should I lead my followers through the dangers of the wilderness to seek a brighter future? I must consider my options.\n\nFar in the west the realms of the [dwarves|E] of the [bluemountains|E] live in prosperity, and though their mansions are a far cry from the great realms of [nogrod|E] and [belegost|E], their realms are mighty still and far from most danger. It would make a perfect place for my kin to live and prosper, but the road there will be long and beset by perils.\n\nYet my heart calls me to a different place altogether. Long have I dreamt and thought of the splendour of [khazaddum|E]: its golden roofs and silver floors and mighty pillars carved from living rock, shimmering in the undimmed light of lamps hewn from crystal. It is fallen, yes, and many would say to go there would be utterly foolish.\n\nPerhaps they are right, but it is as if [mahalcharacter|E] himself beckons me."

Its halls are dark now, but they call to me still, and I cannot resist it.\n\nI shall set off soon, though I do not know what fate lies for me.

For as I walk across the bridge of Khazad-dûm, a creeping feeling overtakes me - beyond the dark of the halls, shadows flit in the darkness - at least, so it seems in the dim light. Still, I cannot give up now - Khazad-dûm is mine, and my peoples. I must be brave for them!\n\nStill, my unease grew steeper as I moved farther into the core of the mountains. Light is of no-use here, the torch I bore lighting scare a foot in front of me. The shadows have grown deeper and fell sounds reach me from hidden catacombs and collapsed halls. Then my feet stop in their tracks - for from the darkness something stares at me, two red glowering eyes.\n\nRun, run, I thought, but my feet stood frozen-still, until an arrow reached them. Then I ran as fast as dwarf-legs can, but all around me I heard the soft pad-pad of enemy footsteps. The exit was blocked and I could only move deeper and deeper."

But as I ran, I realized that my pursuers had changed direction more than once - they were not simply chasing me, they were leading me somewhere! But my insight came too late, for now I could not stop - but a sense of Doom was upon me, and my breath was flagging.\n\nAs I charged through a last set of doors I froze still, torch in one hand and looted axe in the other. Around me, teeming on the floor and the alcoves of the hall, was a huge throng of Orcs girt in black iron and carrying curved steel swords. And I knew that this was my end. But I am Thrór son of Dáin, heir to the line of Durin! I am a son of Mahal!\n\n"Baruk Khazâd!" My axe bit into the flesh of a few encircling orcs, but too little and too late - I was knocked to the ground, a great mace crushing my ribs and knocking the wind out of me. Wheezing, I look upon the leader, a great orc of brute strength. "If your family wishes to know who slew you, beggar-beard, they shall know it was me, [Azog.GetFirstName]!"\n\nI screamed and kicked around, breathless, but it was to no help. [Azog.GetFirstName] hold a blade in his hand and was getting ready to strike for my head. My last thoughts are of my wife, and my son, Thráin."

[Thror.GetFirstName] left his companion outside and entered the mountain alone.\n\nCome to steal from me, little beardling? Very funny! Let me and my orcs show him what we think of Dwarvish jokes.\n\nI let my scouts suround him, cut off his way out and lead him to me, while I ready my great sword - I cannot wait to kill a stinking dwarf! And here he comes - I hear his steps getting closer and closer to me. A dwarf, maybe once a king by the finery of the few jewels on his person, but now lessened, and soon to be dead. One of my lieutenants slams his chest with a mace, and he falls to the floor breathless. My soldiers look to me to claim the final prize, and I raise my sword."

Then [Thror.GetFirstName]´s body was thrown out, and a foul voice issued from [khazaddum|E]. Into [Thror.GetFirstName]´s severed head was carved the name of the master of Moria, foulest of the orcs! [Azog.GetFirstName] was put there, in dwarf-runes. But they did not kill me, instead they send me back with this message, and this... consolation."\n\nNar clutched the bag of coins, only a few and of little worth, and tears flowed freely down his wild, matted beard. With some time, he continued, and relayed the message of vile [Azog.GetFirstName]. "No dwarf shall enter [moria|E]. And they did not let me take [Thror.GetFirstName] back -  they hacked his body to pieced and fed it to black crows."\n\nI have sat for seven days in silence since hearing this news, after tearing my beard and weeping my tears, and I have not eaten out of grief.

 smaug_event_chain.0305.desc:0 "My men and I hide behind everything we can; from piles of gold and jewels to the mighty heads of ancient statues to broken column bases. The wrath of the dragon is great and terrible. Jewels and coins fly like foam in a sea, lashing us. The ground shudders.\n\nA shadow falls upon me as the dragon stretches its wings, mighty and red, and speaks in a booming voice: "My armour is like tenfold shields, my teeth are swords, my claws spears, the shock of my tail a thunderbolt, my wings a hurricane, and my breath death. I am old, and strong, strong, strong!"\n\nYet as he gloats, I spot a tunnel, far away. It might be our only chance of escape, and so I rise to my feet and proclaim as loudly as I can:"

 smaug_event_chain.0306.title:0 "Through the Tunnels"
 smaug_event_chain.0306.desc:0 "The earth shakes behind us and scalding heat burns at my back, but I manage to reach the tunnels. The dragon follows, its snout entering the tunnel from which leaps a thong of flame, but it cannot reach us. Neither can the dragon proceed further, for the tunnel is too narrow. We stop and catch our breaths as the dragon retreats. I grip my axe tightly.\n\nThe tunnel rumbles. A mighty roar fills the air. We sprint.\n\nOverhead Smaug unleashes his wroth, and the tunnels shake violently as we sprint as fast as we can. Cracks appear around us. They grow bigger and more numerous, like spider's webs in the concrete, before pieces start to collapse behind us. My feet burn.\n\n"Come on!" I exclaim, and Smaug roars as if in return. There is a boom, and ahead of us a piece of rubble falls down, blocking us. The dragon laughs deeply. I get under it, supported by a fellow Dwarf, and with all the strength I can muster, I push."

 smaug_event_chain.0307.desc:0 "All my body aches, but I press on, the tips of my beard singed with flame. At last the tunnel ends, and we enter into a series of high but small halls, leading into another maze of corridors. I falter for a moment as I choose which one to go down.\n\n"Pesky Dwarves!" In a flash of red and gold, Smaug lands before us, wings outstretched. Embers and smoke arise from his nostrils. His claws dig into the ground, and his belly sparkles with a coat of diamond; save for a single spot on his left breast. "What now shall you do?"\n\nHe leaps forward, and I roll to the side, his claws swinging right by me. He turns around and unleashing a mighty boom whips his tail, under which I duck. It passes overhead and with a roar I embed my axe into his tail, only to be launched to the other side of the room. My helm protects my head from the marble wall, and I land near the entrance to a corridor. Where it leads, I do not know, but this is our only hope."

 smaug_event_chain.0308.title:0 "Dragon-fire"
 smaug_event_chain.0308.desc:0 "Fire follows us. It is like a rushing river, raging down the hallways, the shadows dancing. These hallways are not as long, and often merge and turn away and lead to more and more halls. My company is split, some Dwarves running down different hallways and corridors.\n\nSmaug is distracted. Sometimes his eye is trained on me, and I zigzag trying desperately to avoid turning into ashes, until his focus relents. Occasionally I throw an axe to distract him, and sometimes my company to the same, though they always bounce off harmlessly from his diamond-encrusted belly.\n\nI swing into another corridor, away from the dragon's eyes, and I sprint up a winding flight of stairs. I do not know where I go, but I emerge on a high balcony, and I look over the halls. I spot Smaug's current object of focus, a group of Dwarves running almost directly under me, and the dragon follows below. In front of me on a ledge is a bronze head, and if I drop it, it is my chance to save my fellow Dwarves. I must take it."

 smaug_event_chain.0309.desc:0 "The head lands on the dragon with a thunderous and resounding crash. It echoes in the hall. My companions know well enough to hide, and so do I. I rush into a dark corner, a place as apt for hiding as any I could find in a few moments, and wait with bated breath.\n\n"Foul thieving Dwarves!" Smaug snorts with a voice filled with malice. "You hide now, but you shall meet my wrath soon enough. I know that the men of the Lake were your helpers, for I smell them upon you. Up the water you came without a doubt! It is time, then, to pay your friends a visit. They shall see me and remember who is the real King under the Mountain!"\n\nHe arises now in dancing fire, heart burning with rage, and takes off. South he shall go, to Esgaroth upon the Long Lake he shall go, and they shall feel his wroth. Only our deaths would abate his fury."

 smaug_event_chain.0310.desc:0 "The air is cold as I look upon the far-off Lonely Mountain, its peak flickering and flashing against the black night. Perhaps it is those Dwarves, who had arrived in Esgaroth some days ago, forging their gold in the deeps of the Mountain. I take a deep breath, and the townsfolk open their shutters and exit their houses to look upon the display.\n\nSuddenly the lake's northern end turns golden, and a gasp arises from the awe-struck crowd. But it is the doing of no Dwarf. The trumpets sound to greet the incoming dragon, like a spark of fire quickly approaching. My men ready their bows and aim, and the dragon soars overhead, being met with a hail of arrows. They all bounce off.\n\nFury arises from the dragon's jaws. The trees upon the shore turn blood-red before the dancing shadows. Fire leaps from the thatched roofs, and the quays are consumed in red. Yet through the black smoke and golden flame, I spot a small patch upon the dragon's belly unprotected by its diamond scales. This is our one chance."

 smaug_event_chain.0311.desc:0 "The crows about the mountain swirl and cry unceasingly above. From the south come flocks of birds; finches and starlings, and carrion-birds farther off. It is very peculiar, I think to myself as I look up to them, and as I do a thrush lands near me.\n\nIt seems to be trying talk to me, though its meaning is unintelligible, and one of my party says that he wishes it were a raven that were here instead. With a chirp the thrush flies off, and I sit silently once more. A cool wind is at my back.\n\nI am startled at a croak when beside me lands an old raven. He introduces himself quickly, quickly gets to the point: the birds gather to the Lonely Mountain and Dale again, for Smaug is dead.\n\nMy party and I arise with shocked gasps, and we rush to the south of the Mountain. There, far-off, I descry Smaug dead upon the smoldering ruins of Lake-Town, and joy takes my heart. The dragon is dead, and the treasure is ours!"

 smaug_event_chain.0312.title:0 "Fire Upon Water"
 smaug_event_chain.0312.desc:0 "I can only watch in horror and shock as the lake is set aflame. Esgaroth, a city of wood upon water, is ablaze. The trees by the shore shine like copper and blood, leaping black shadows at their feet. With each pass, fire leaps from the dragon's jaws.\n\nArrows launch in volleys, but they all bounce off the dragon's underbelly. The thatched roofs explode in flame, and quaysides are consumed in red and gold. Flames unquenchable spring high into the night. The dragon turns again, its tail descending upon the city and leaving a trail of splinters and crumbling ruins in its wake.\n\nBoats leave desperately. They shall be sport for Smaug later. Soon Esgaroth is black cinder and sputtering embers fallen into a lake. The dragon rises into the night at last, straight for the Lonely Mountain."

 smaug_event_chain.0313.desc:0 "The dragon turns, mouth agape, throat glowing red, and in that moment there is a twang. The stinging of the flame does not faze me as I look upon the black arrow flying, straight for the one spot upon the dragon's below that does not glitter and sparkle. It seems an eternal moment.\n\nIt lands clean; barb, shaft, and feather disappearing in the dragon's left breast.\n\nThe shriek let out by the dragon fells trees, splits rock, and deafens men. I grasp my ears in pain, watching with wide eyes as it shoots spouting into the air, before it at last turns over and falls. As it does I leap into the water and swim, and I hear the cacophonous crash behind me; the splintering and breaking of wood that lets out hissing embers and gledes. The water swirls, white steam rising up.\n\nI catch my breath as I finally reach the shore, and far off I descry Esgaroth, now ruins upon which lays Smaug the Golden, silent and dead."
