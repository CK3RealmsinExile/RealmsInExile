Your summons honours me, my lord, though troubling whispers reach my ears."\n\nI say nothing, my eyes narrowing as I watch him press on.

If I remain, I will die.\n\nI force myself to my feet, staggering back in the direction of the hall. Each step is an agony, each breath a rasp.

The man who once ruled Rohan with unshakable strength sits in defeat, his pride intact but his throne now gone.\n\nEvery fiber of my being cries out for vengeance. To strike him down would fulfill the oath I swore and avenge the blood spilled by his hands. Yet, as I stare at him, the weight of the crown I’ve fought so hard to claim presses down on me. Killing him would ignite anger among the Rohirrim, a people I must now rule.\n\nThe thought of releasing him twists in my chest like a knife. It is against every vow I made, but I cannot ignore the power of mercy to strengthen my rule. Still, mercy is not without risk. A man like Helm will not stay idle. Should he gather enough support, this mercy could turn into a blade pointed at my own back."

My life has been spent fighting for Rohan, for its people, for my family. But as I kneel here, I cannot escape the bitter truth: I failed them. My people suffer, their trust shattered.

Let them see my mercy and know that the future of Rohan is mine to shape.”\n\nI rise to my feet, the cold stone floor beneath me a bitter reminder of how far I have fallen. His words linger like a blade pressed to my throat. He spares me, not out of compassion, but to strengthen his claim and my humiliation.\n\nAs I leave the dungeon, my thoughts turn to my family.
