After a while, I encounter a peculiar wanderer, an old man clad in brown garb wearing an unusual hat. He seems to be collecting mushrooms. I greet him and respectfully ask for a way out of the forest. He replies, though he doesn't really seem to pay attention to me:\n\n"Out of the forest? Very simple, just climb up a tree and look around! Ooh, this is a nice one..."\n\nI follow his advice and from the top of the tree I am able to make out the road! When I climb down, I realize he has disappeared and it slowly dawns on me this may have been the [sageofthewoods|E] himself! But did his advice have any deeper meaning?"
 lotr_travel_events.0006.desc.advice2:0 " As I make my way through a dense bush, I suddenly spot an odd figure, an old man clad in brown garb and wearing an unusual hat, some distance away. He appears to be mumbling at someone else, though I can only make out a few words: \n\n"...there, there, I have enough. Hah! You are a funny one. Yes, perhaps they truly are the pinnacle of creation!"\n\nUpon closer inspection, he appears to be feeding acorns to a large deer. Moments later, he seems to have disappeared between two trees.

 lotr_travel_events.0006.desc.advice3:0 " Eventually an old man, clad in brown garb and wearing an unusual hat, appears from the foliage to my right, intending to cross the road. He seems to be upset. As we cross paths he grumbles something vaguely directed at me:\n\n"Ho there! Have you seen my hat? Its a nice hat, very big, but I lost it!" He then lets out a long sigh. "Well, it can't be that far! It'll show up again eventually, always does, so I suppose it's not too bad."\n\nI am too baffled to respond to him and he passes me quickly, going off into the deep woods to my left. It slowly dawns on me that this may have been the [sageofthewoods|E] himself! But do his words have any deeper meaning?" 
 lotr_travel_events.0006.desc.advice4:0 " Eventually, I come across a large bush of blueberries and decide to rest for a bit. While I am holding my impromptu berry-feast, a peculiar wanderer, an old man clad in brown garb wearing an unusual hat, walks by. He takes a moment to smell the bush, then picks a single berry and puts it into his mouth.\n\n"I like blueberries, but they taste sweetest when you eat them one at a time!"\n\nWith that, he continues to make his way through the forest, soon disappearing between two trees. After I finish my rest, it slowly dawns on me that this may have been the [sageofthewoods|E] himself! But do his words have any deeper meaning?"

In the plains and forests dwelled the Swift Men, our distant forebears, who could run as fast as the autumn winds. And in the mountains and hills dwelled the Stout Men, who were of small statue and made of rock. In friendship, they made a pact in stone and bronze, carved into the great gate dividing their homelands.\n\nBut one day, a deep, unending fog appeared, from which came forth dark creatures, monsters, and goblins, who sought to destroy both of their realms! Together, the two peoples fought valiantly, and after many great battles, too mighty to recount, they came close to defeating their foes once and for all. But in the final hour before their victory, the monsters smashed the pact-gate.\n\nTheir bond now broken, the Swift Men and the Stout Men began to squabble, and the Stout Men dug themselves deep into the rock, where they began brooding far from the sun. The terrors came upon the Swift Men, who fought valiantly, but eventually had to flee to the fae realm, where the King of Spring and his wife, the Queen of Autumn granted them refuge. The terrors then swarmed unto the Stout Men, destroying their remaining dwellings atop the mountains and driving them deeper and deeper into the earth, until they became one with the rock and disappeared for many centuries.\"#!"

Another claims that [tale_character_center.GetFirstNameNicknamedRegnal]'s mother made a pact with the Fae-King of the Woods, who ruled all the trees in the world and was himself a mighty oak, as large as the [mistymountains|E]! She gave him her firstborn child to raise in exchange for wealth and many horses, to feed her starving children. The Fae-King then spoke to [tale_character_center.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]: 'Thou shall liveth as we do, thy hair shall turn to leaf, and thou shall never die of old age, as long as thou respect the forest and its trees!'\n\nThus he was raised among the fae, drinking their tree-sap for nourishment. He learned to speak the language of the winds, to craft magical tools out of moss and to live in the wood as they do. Over twelve centuries, he sired twelve sons and many more, and he was crowned king of these men. But when his children came of age, they took their axes and began to cut down the trees, who whispered in fear and cried to their king for help. Thus the Fae-King spoke, with a booming voice: 'Thou hath broken our trust and cut down thine elders! For this, I banish thee and thy kin to the edge of the woods for twelve dozen moons!'\n\n[tale_character_center.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] was devastated, for he realized he had failed to teach his children how to act among the woods. He and his kin moved to the edge of the forest, where he took great care in educating them for twelve moons. But he began to fade and his leaves turned orange and brown. Eventually, he sat down upon a hill in the south, from whence he could see the heart of the woods. Struck with grief, he sprouted roots and remained there, forever whispering his sorrow into the winds. Though he would never know this, the Fae-King had long forgiven him, for his children were moved deeply by his teachings, and had sworn to forever protect the forest and its inhabitants from harm. His descendants still dwell there, now known to us as the [woodmen_scope.GetName] of [mirkwood|E]!\"#!"

It blew him far off course, for [storyteller.GetFaith.WaterGodName] held a grudge against him for deflowering his daughter, the fair nymph Kîrmael. Four of his ship were sunk that night, but his flagship, the 'Unreliant', which he had stolen from the Ashen Harbour of the Nereids, prevailed. Its' hull, from bow to stern, was painted with liquid moonlight and was thus unsinkable, for the moon's reflection can't ever sink beneath the waves!\n\nAfter seven days and seven nights, he came upon a strange towering figure, rising from the depths. It was a king's visage, long weathered from the tides, that arose next to his ship from the deep but clear waters, its' stone-carved body submerged below its chin. There, beneath the waves, he saw a great metropolis with large, domed structures, citadels of great beauty and high towers, emerging from further below. He had come upon the great sunken empire of Vanwa Atalantë, where the fish-folk had since ages past dwelled in old splendor.\n\nLong ago, it had been a great and powerful dominion of Men - Until, out of envy, the gods awoke a great water-beast known as the Belraeg, which laid waste to the great realm, before falling asleep upon its corpse - raising the water levels, creating the Belegaer as we know it today. Those few who survived were known as the Atalantëatani, the Sunken Folk, cursed by the gods to become creatures of the deep, never to breathe air again.\n\nCaptain Sûramir knew this, of course, as he had learned the secret knowledge of ages past from the great Craken Tûrmak during his voyage to the ocean beneath the great grottos of Rûrk. His silver eye soon spotted some of the Sunken Folk, bloated and scaly, who were known to drown sailors with their nets, which they threw out beneath the waves.

[tale_character_right.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] was outnumbered three to one, but his warriors were much better experienced, having skirmished with the [chelkari_scope.GetName] for much of their life. It was also said they could outrun a heavy charriot on foot.\n\nThe battle was finally opened by [tale_character_left.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], who ordered his warriors to charge their enemy, hoping to simply overpower them with their superior numbers. Immediately, the thundering sound of thousands of warriors charging into battle reverberated through the gap. [tale_character_right.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] had of course hoped for this, and sacrificed twenty eagles the week prior in hopes of gaining the favor of Tûmrakhi. The ground had become wet and unsturdy from the ensuing rain, and with a gushing sound like that of an opened wound, a great part of the muddied terrain began to come loose and slide down, causing the charge to falter and the men to stumble and fall. [tale_character_right.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] then dissolved his formation, and his lightly armored veterans, some on horseback, descended upon their enemies in a bloody dance of death, sowing death wherever they came. While his commanders were trying to restore order among the now panicked soldiers, [tale_character_left.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] was forced to bring his reserve units in early, so that the men at the front could not flee from battle.\n\nHowever, [tale_character_left.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] had not anticipated the enemy within.

Razarac, 'Drought-Bringer', the old tribes called it. For wherever it came, it brought pain and destruction. Its' breath unleashed droughts and its' gaze drained oases. It was cursed by the gods with unending thirst, never to be sated. So it sought out life where it could, to drain the springs and rivers of [harad|E]. A great many tribes were sundered until the Windlord heard the peoples' cries and chose a champion, brave and resolute, to face the demon. His champion's name was Tarik and he was a legendary swordsman - In combat, he wielded three scimitars, and no foe had ever escaped his blade. Blessed by the Windlord with unending resolve, he set out to face the creature and to bring it to ruin, guided by a great eagle along his path. After many days of travel, he finally found Razarac in the ruins of a great city. Mere days ago it was a bustling metropolis, now ruined by its' evil.\n\n'Face me, Destroyer!', called Tarek, for he was a man of few words and many blades. Razarac glared at him with disgust and silence, for its throat had long dried out and it was unable to speak. A great battle ensued, and Tarek swiftly engaged his foe,  cutting his foe with blades swift as the wind. They fought fiercely, from dawn to dusk and dusk to dawn. The demon struck with the might of earth and thunder and it's hide was fierce and coarse as sand. But Tarek's strikes were quick, precise, and, like a scorpion's, always found a weak spot. Eventually, he had worn down Razarac enough to land a finishing blow. He felled it and pierced it's foul heart, destroying its mortal form. But the creature was cunning and with its last rattling breath, whispered it's spirit into the sandy winds, where he knew no mortal could harm it.\n\nBut the Windlord had seen this coming and had his eagle whisper the true name of the winds into Tarek's ear, allowing him to pursue the demon. And so, wherever Razarac's vile spirit rests to regain his strength, Tarek is sure to soon follow and engage in combat once more in a great cycle. Their divine duels appear to us as the great sandstorms that bring drought and destruction. They are fiercest in the dunes where Razarac's form was felled, in the eternal battlefield now known as the Dune Sea, as the Mirror of Fire.\"#!"

While it was forming there, it was still vulnerable, and so perhaps his plan to could still be prevented.\n\nThe following day, Iunást told his tribe of the divine mission he had received from the goddess. Gatara, who was in those days already a well known seer and mystic, quickly proclaimed that he would accompany his childhood friend on his arduous journey north.
