 purge_of_ray.0001.desc.hereward: "No challenges to the throne of the [ray.GetName] will be forthcoming. The "heretical" nobles lie scattered, meek and passive, stripped of their rank and power. All grovel at [ruler_ray.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] feet.\n\nMy purpose is lost. With the Normans now here to stay, there is no hope for an non Khäz-gramaze future. At best, we will merge and become part of the fabric of the land; at worst, we will disappear from history entirely."
 purge_of_ray.0001.desc.mardat: "I am ascendant: nobody dares challenge my power in [ray.GetName]. The heretical nobles lie scattered, meek and passive, paying homage to me for fear of further retribution. Each one will kiss my ring and supplicate themselves before me by the time the year is out.\n\nMy rule is uncontested, and I can now move on to further ambitions."
 purge_of_ray.0001.desc.therest: "The fierce resistance that faced [ruler_ray.GetTitledFirstName] has finally dissolved in face of bitter retribution. Khäz-gramaze rule over [ray.GetName] is now uncontested."

 purge_of_ray.0002.desc: "With an Vâtraist once more on the throne of the [ray.GetName], the Purge of Rây can truly be said to be over.\n\n"
 purge_of_ray.0002.desc.hereward: "Our cause was righteous, the challenges mighty, the retribution bitter. Yet the Vâtraist spirit prevailed, and we now return to our rightful place in the seats of power in these lands.\n\nI must now put down my sword. Perhaps not yet beat it into a plowshare, for the realm's enemies remain numerous, but the legend of the Wake must now slowly fade from memory."
 purge_of_ray.0002.desc.ruler: "The Khäz-gramaze interlopers melt away before us. Some remain clinging to their power, some return to their homeland, and still more lie feet beneath England's fair grasses.\n\nNone of them dare challenge my position."
 purge_of_ray.0002.desc.therest: "The successful invasion has quickly turned into a nightmare for the Khäz-gramaze interlopers, and the ascension to power of [ruler_ray.GetTitledFirstName] has finally put paid to foreign ambitions for the throne. For now."

We sit above them, appointed by [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName], but it is through their back-breaking labor that our power thrives.\n\nGrain is, in turn, the lifeblood of the peasantry. Less grain means fewer peasants. The fewer the peasants, the weaker the [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord]. And the weaker the [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord]..."

Ensuring safe passage for ourselves is paramount, but any road can be used by both sides..."

[captured.GetSheHe|U] sounds the word out, considering the implications. "And I'll be accepted as one of you?"\n\nI take a moment to fully explore the ramifications of my hastily-made proposal, too. If I am to rule this land, I will need as many fellow [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetCollectiveNounNoTooltip] around me as I can possibly muster.
