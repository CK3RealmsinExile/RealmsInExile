 glorfindel.0001.t: "The Dream of Flame and Frost"
 glorfindel.0001.desc: "It is a particularly starless night in [imladris|E], the skies overcast by an impenetrable layer of clouds. Seldom do the [elves|E] require sleep, but this night I decide to lay down in my bed.\n\nSoon enough, I drift off into a dream - but within it, a fire begins to rise. I stand once more upon the walls of [gondolin|E], spear in hand, as [dragons|E] roar and flame devours the white towers. The sky is filled with smoke and screams. Then, the fire turns to frost. Snow falls - first gently, then in blinding sheets. Through the storm, I see dark shapes moving in the north. Not dragons, but shadows - men, beasts, and worse. A faint voice calls to me from beyond the mountains, pleading for light.\n\nI wake, cold and breathless. It is only a dream... is it not? The weight of the past presses on my chest, and the echoes of loss whisper through my mind like a haunting melody. I cannot ignore the stirring in my spirit, nor the sense that the world holds its breath, waiting for a reckoning."
 glorfindel.0001.a: "This is no idle dream. The shadow in the East stirs again."
 glorfindel.0001.a.tt: "You will travel to [imladris|E] to speak with [elrondshort|E]"
 glorfindel.0001.b: "These are merely old memories. I ought to let the past rest."
 glorfindel.0001.b.tt: "#n You will opt out of Glorfindel's story content"
 
 glorfindel.0002.t: "The Wisdom of Elrond"
 glorfindel.0002.desc: "I find [elrond.GetFirstName] on one of the many balconies of [imladris|E], where the air is softly dampened by the ever-flowing waterfalls of the Bruinen that crash down from the [mistymountains|E]. I tell the Lord of Imladris of the dream that came to me: the fire consuming [gondolin|E], the frost that followed, and the dark figures moving through the shadows.\n\nElrond listens with the patience and wisdom I have long respected. His eyes, deep pools of ancient knowledge, reflect the weight of ages and the sorrow of many lost days. "These visions trouble you, as they should," he says in a pensive tone. "The darkness that we once thought defeated stirs again, though few can yet see it. You are not alone in your vigilance, Glorfindel."\n\nHis words calm some of the unrest in my heart, but the fire within me only grows. The peace we cherish here feels fragile, like glass waiting to shatter. I must prepare to face what comes - alone, or with others, I will not turn from this path."
 glorfindel.0002.a: "I will take your counsel to heart and stand ready."
 glorfindel.0002.a.tt: "Unlocks a [decision|E] to set out into the wilderness"

 glorfindel.0003.t: "The Search Begins"
 glorfindel.0003.desc: "At first light, I gather my arms and provisions. [elrond.GetFirstName] counsels caution, but he does not question my resolve. 'Few now remember the darkness that once ruled these lands,' he says. 'But you do. Go, and let your light shine once more in the wilderness.'\n\nWith a small escort, I ride north - toward ancient ruins, forgotten roads, and whatever dark figures I was shown in my dream. The wind carries whispers of old battles and lost heroes, and every step reminds me that peace is a fragile gift.\n\nWhatever stirs in the dark, I will meet it with spear and flame. As I did in [gondolin|E]. As I must until the end."
 glorfindel.0003.a: "My search begins here."
 glorfindel.0003.b: "Let no songs be sung. I go alone, like a shadow beneath the trees."
 glorfindel.0003.tt: "You will travel towards [GetTitleByKey('c_cameth_brin').GetNameNoTier]"
 
 glorfindel.0004.t: "Echoes in the Stones"
 glorfindel.0004.desc: "In a secluded glen near the tower of [GetTitleByKey('c_cameth_brin').GetNameNoTier], shrouded by ivy and silence, I find a small ruin - ancient, possibly elven, and somehow familiar. I slide off Asfaloth's back in order to investigate further. A few weathered columns lie half-buried in moss, and cracked marble bears an almost enitrely timeworn sigil that displays a striking resemblece to the emblem of House of the Golden Flower.\n\nMy hand brushes a broken helm beneath a cairn. Once, it gleamed beneath the starlit skies of the Second Age, when this land was the domain of the High King. Now, it is but dust and memory. And yet the memory of the city of Singing Stone stirs faintly in my heart; not to grieve, but to remember.\n\nThe stones whisper tales of valor and defiance, of kin lost to shadow yet never forgotten. I kneel and vow to keep their stories alive, for memory is the light that darkness cannot consume."
 glorfindel.0004.a: "These memories will not fade. I carry them forward."
 glorfindel.0004.a.tt: "You pick up one of the artifacts in the ruins"
 glorfindel.0004.a.tt.a: "You gained an artifact"
 glorfindel.0004.b: "Let this place sleep undisturbed, as Gondolin does."
 glorfindel.0004.tt: "You continue your search westwards"
 
 glorfindel.0005.t: "A Fleeting Resemblence"
 glorfindel.0005.desc: "At the edge of a frostbound stream near the Weather Hills, I come across a Ranger of the North. He is hooded and wary, yet noble in bearing, and recognizes me quickly. One of the [dunedainnorth|E], he has tracked a band of [goblins|E] alone for days, undeterred and unafraid. His sword is old, but well-kept; his eyes carry the weight of sorrow and purpose.\n\nWe share a fire and few words. Yet as he departs, I see in him a faint echo; of Beren, of Túor, of all the mortal heroes I once knew. That same quiet valor, that same burden carried without song.\n\nTheir days are brief. But they burn bright. And perhaps it is for their kind that I remain in this world: a ceaseless guardian to shield the fleeting light from shadow’s grasp."
 glorfindel.0005.a: "The blood of [numenor|E] has not thinned entirely. There is hope yet."
 glorfindel.0005.b: "Men will depart, as they are fated to do. We [elves|E] must carry on."
 glorfindel.0005.tt: "You continue your search westwards"
 
 glorfindel.0006.t: "The Whispering Barrows"
 glorfindel.0006.desc: "Fog rises as I cross into the Tyrn Gorthad, where the [dunedain|E] of [arnor|E] once laid their dead to rest. An eerie wind howls in this place.\n\nOn the downs where forgotten kings once slept, the mists cling like cold hands. The earth beneath my feet feels hollow. When I speak, my breath turns to frost, and in the shadows of the barrow ahead, something stirs, and I know it to be neither wind nor beast.\n\nA wight moves in the dark, its presence ancient and foul, bound by sorcery older than any man that now walks under the sun. Its whispers crawl through the tombs like rot: a voice promising death, despair, and dominion over the grave.\n\nThe shadows here cling tightly, resisting the sun’s touch. I can feel the chill seep into my bones, but I will not yield. This evil must be faced, lest it spread its curse beyond these hills."
 glorfindel.0006.a: "I will drive it back. Let light and flame cleanse this place!"
 glorfindel.0006.tt: "You continue your search westwards"

 glorfindel.0007.t: "A Peaceful Land, A Gentle People"
 glorfindel.0007.desc: "The Shire. The folk here are small in stature, but there is strength in their simplicity: cheer in their gardens, joy in their laughter, and wisdom in the way they love their land.\n\nNo watchmen patrol their roads. They do not know of the wars I have fought, and still they wave to me as if I were just another traveler passing by. A child offers me a scone, beaming up at me with eyes unclouded by sorrow. I find myself pondering this peace. Is it a fragile dream? Or is it something more enduring? A hidden strength, forged not in battle, but in joy?\n\nI feel both comforted and sorrowful. I think of [gondolin|E], and how we once lived there in beauty, unaware of what lurked beyond our mountain-walls. This place reminds me of that lost grace. I will pass on in silence, but will remember the courage of this land."
 glorfindel.0007.a: "Let them have their peace. Others will keep watch from afar."
 glorfindel.0007.b: "Even such a small people will not be untouched forever."
 glorfindel.0007.c: "Perhaps they understand something we have forgotten."
 glorfindel.0007.tt: "You continue your search westwards"
 
 glorfindel.0008.t: "The Sea Longing"
 glorfindel.0008.desc: "The scent of salt reaches me before I see the sea. It is sharp and cold and stirs something deep within me; older than this age, older even than [gondolin|E]. I ride on until I see it: the grey waves, endless and glimmering, reaching westward beyond sight and time. I feel a familiar sting in my chest. There is  faint call - not of duty, but of home. It is as though a hidden door within me has opened. I remember the white shores of [aman|E], the slender ships and the light of the Trees. I remember peace without sorrow, song without mourning. For a moment, I long only to return.\n\nBut I do not move. My hand rests on Asfaloth's neck, unmoving as my thoughts are drawn not to [valinor|E], but to the north; to shadows lingering in forest and ruin, to cold winds that whisper of war yet to come. I have been twice-born, once slain in fire, once returned by grace. Was it for this? To gaze upon the sea and surrender, or to remain a while longer; to guard, to guide, to endure?\n\nThe sea calls me, as it does all [elves|E]. But so too does the land I walk. There is one I could speak to about this matter..."
 glorfindel.0008.a: "Come, Asfaloth. Bear me to [mithlond|E]."
 glorfindel.0008.a.tt: "You continue to the Grey Havens"
 
 glorfindel.0009.t: "Círdan’s Counsel"
 glorfindel.0009.desc: "[cirdan.GetFirstName] receives me at [mithlond|E] with the quiet dignity that has always marked him. There is no ceremony, no flourish; only the sea behind him and the calm wisdom of an Elf who has watched ages pass like falling leaves. He sees the question in my eyes before I speak.\n\nWe talk as the gulls cry overhead. I tell him of the dreams, of the shadows stirring, of the Shire and its fragile hope. I speak of the lone Ranger I encountered, and the long-lost ruins I passed by. And he listens; not to give me an answer, but to remind me that answers are not always what we seek.\n\nHe tells me that many have passed west, their tasks fulfilled. Others remained, holding fast to a hope unseen. "There is no shame in sailing," he says. "Nor in staying. All you have to decide is whether #italic your#! task in this world has been fulfilled."\n\nHis words leave me in silence. I walk the quays alone for a time, watching ships sway in the harbor, each one a promise of peace. As I reach the last one of them, I am at peace. My time has not yet reached its end. There is still work to be done."
 glorfindel.0009.a: "Not all things that are broken can be mended. But I will try."
 glorfindel.0009.tt: "You continue your search northwards"

 glorfindel.0010.t: "A Kindred Flame"
 glorfindel.0010.desc: "The peaceful woods of [forlindon|E] are quiet, cloaked in morning mist and the long-forgotten songs of the trees. I feel as though I am passing through the living memory of [beleriand|E] that now lies beneath the waves. It is here that I come across another traveller, riding an elven chestnut steed. She comes into view like a memory returning. She does not name herself, but I know her kind: from the House of the Harp she must be, having fled the fire that consumed [gondolin|E]. Her eyes hold the same shadows as mine - the weight of loss, the silence of long years spent wandering, unhealed and uncalled.\n\nAs I approach, I see her recognize me, halting next to the road. We speak of little things: old names, lost friends, the scent of the fountains in the King’s court before the fall. Her voice is soft, but when I speak of the dream - the one I saw, the fire and the frost, the sense of something stirring - her gaze sharpens. She has seen signs, too. And though she has walked alone for many ages, something now stirs her heart to motion.\n\n"I would walk with you," she says. "Not because I doubt your ability to defeat whatever shade is approaching. But because I could not let it pass unanswered. Not again." A part of me wishes to shield her from what lies ahead. Another part knows that no one can face the darkness alone."
 glorfindel.0010.a: "Come with me, then. We shall ride together."
 glorfindel.0010.b: "Your burden is heavy. Do not take up mine too."
 glorfindel.0010.tt: "You continue your search northwards"

 glorfindel.0011.t: "The Lost Glory of the Noldor"
 glorfindel.0011.desc.a: "The wind off Lake Helevorn is sharp and cold. Among the roots of the hills lie the crumbling stones of what once was a proud fastness. We have found the ruins of Caranthir’s hall - the once mighty stronghold of a fallen son of [feanor|E], long since swept away by war and time.\n\nThe walls are shattered, and the gates broken. Nothing remains of beauty here; only the bones of it fall, cloaked in silence. I step across a cracked threshold and feel the echoes of voices that once rang through these chambers: defiant, bitter, proud. The ghosts of an age that would not yield.\n\nEven in ruin, there is a weight here. A warning. The [noldorelves|E] were mighty, once. And yet even the mightiest fell: some to blade, some to flame, and some to their own folly. Caranthir’s might was vast, and yet it carried him and his kin to ruin. This place remembers.\n\n[gondolindrim_maiden.GetFirstName] says nothing, but I see the thoughts behind her eyes. We are not so far removed from those days. Are we wiser now? Or merely fewer? I kneel in the dust and lay my hand upon a scorched stone. The world has changed, and still we wander it, chasing shadows-carrying both memory and guilt. There is no glory here. Only lessons."

And yet even the mightiest fell: some to blade, some to flame, and some to their own folly. Caranthir’s might was vast, and yet it carried him and his kin to ruin. This place remembers.\n\nI halt next to a broken pillar, lost in thought for a moment. We are not so far removed from those days. Are we wiser now? Or merely fewer?\n\nI kneel in the dust and lay my hand upon a scorched stone. The world has changed, and still we wander it, chasing shadows-carrying both memory and guilt. There is no glory here. Only lessons."
 glorfindel.0011.a: "We will not repeat the same mistakes."
 glorfindel.0011.b: "Even ashes bear wisdom worth remembering."
 glorfindel.0011.tt: "You continue your search northwards"
 
 glorfindel.0012.t: "The Path of Shadows"
 glorfindel.0012.desc.a: "The winds howl louder as we press northward, into lands where the stars grow pale and the ice never thaws. The sun hides behind gray veils, and each breath I draw feels heavy with silence. We have come to the borders of Forochel: a vast, empty, and bitterly still land. Yet the silence here is not peace. It is the waiting hush before a storm.\n\nWe soon begin to uncover signs. A trail of carcasses torn and left to rot, their blood frozen into black glass. Trees snapped and twisted, great stones bearing gouges that no beast should leave. In the snow, clawed footprints the size of shields. And always, the feeling of being watched by something old, and hungry.\n\nThen we find the corpses. They must have been Lossoth foragers who strayed too far from their huts. Slain not in battle, but hunted, their bodies broken and left half-buried. My hand goes to my sword, unbidden. The dream is no longer memory or omen. \n\nOur foes are real. Snow-trolls they must be; tall as towers, their eyes blind with malice and cold fire. Not beasts of stone, but ancient spawn of the mountains, twisted by the dark and now grown bold. A horde gathers in the far north, their howls echoing across the tundra. They will not remain in Forochel, I fear.\n\nThis is the shadow I saw. Not a memory of the past, but a threat of the present. I was not called to chase ghosts. I was called to stand against the darkness once more."

I was not called to chase ghosts. I was called to stand against the darkness once more."
 glorfindel.0012.a: "This peril is what I was meant to find."
 glorfindel.0012.a.tt: "You will travel east in search of the trolls"

 glorfindel.0013.t: "Into Peril"
 glorfindel.0013.desc: "The storm breaks at last. The sky above Forochel is torn open by black clouds and roaring winds, and through the flurries I see them: the Trolls, pale as bone and looming large, moving through the snow in silence. No drums. No cries. Just the endless crunch of frost beneath their feet.\n\nI have followed their trail to the edge of their den: a shattered vale of stone, where the ice is slick with blood and bones. They have grown in number, feasting on beasts, men, and worse. Their chieftain stands above the rest, a monster crowned in iron and fur, his arms like tree trunks, his eyes gleaming with dull fire. The darkness that stirred in my dream now stands before me in flesh.\n\nThere is no time to rally armies. No time for counsel. If I turn away now, the North will bleed. Many will suffer, maybe even the Shire will be attacked, and [imladris|E] may stand alone. But if I strike now, I can shatter their will. I can remind them that there are still powers in the world they should fear.\n\nI ready my blade. I speak a few words into the wind-perhaps to the Valar, perhaps to old friends long gone. The air is sharp and alive with danger. But I feel no fear. Only fire. I did not cross the ages to watch the world freeze in silence. I came to fight.\n\nAnd so I raise my voice in defiance and charge into the storm. Flame against frost. Light against darkness. One last stand."
 glorfindel.0013.a: "This is the end for you, beasts."
 glorfindel.0013.a.success: "You vanquish your foes"
 glorfindel.0013.a.failure: "You are wounded in the fight"

 glorfindel.0014.t: "The Long Road South"
 glorfindel.0014.desc.b: "The wind is quiet now. The air stills, and the snows begin to fall softly once more; not as a cloak of doom, but as a shroud for the dead. The Trolls are broken. Their chieftain lies still beneath the ice, and the few survivors have scattered into the dark corners of the north, wounded and afraid. The storm is spent.\n\nI walk among the fallen in silence. The ground is littered with fragments: bones, blades, shattered stones. I find no triumph in it, only a strange kind of peace. The dream that stirred me from [imladris|E] has run its course. The shadow that once loomed now fades behind me.\n\nBut the world is not healed. Evil may be driven back, but it is never gone. It waits. It watches. And so I cannot claim rest, only a pause. The road winds south again, toward the Hidden Vale, where the stars are softer and memories are gentler.\n\nThere, I may find some rest. Or perhaps only a moment’s breath. I will return for now. Not in retreat, but in remembrance. I have seen what stirs in the forgotten places of the world, and I will not let it rise again unnoticed.\n\nWhen the time comes, I will walk the wilds again. Until then, in Imladris I shall remain."
 glorfindel.0014.desc.a: "The wind is quiet now. The air stills, and the snows begin to fall softly once more; not as a cloak of doom, but as a shroud for the dead. Around us, the remnants of battle lie frozen: twisted limbs, shattered spears, and the great hulks of the slain Trolls, now still as stone.\n\n[gondolindrim_maiden.GetFirstName] stands beside me; her blade wet with the memory of the fight, her gaze sharp, though tired. We fought together as if we had always known each other’s rhythm, each other's silence. Side by side, we held the line against the monstrous tide. And when the Troll-chieftain fell, it was by our joined hands.\n\nFor a while, we say nothing. There is only the wind, the cold, and the lingering weight of victory. Then, at last, I speak: not to celebrate, but to name what was done, and what must follow. The danger is passed, but the world is not yet healed. Evil retreats, but it never dies.\n\nWe make our way south together. The journey has changed us both, carved new purpose into old souls. I ache to return to [imladris|E], a deep urge for rest and reflection within me. She feels it too, though neither of us says it aloud. Perhaps we return not in triumph, but in understanding.\n\nThe North endures, for now. And we, weary but unbroken, walk the long road home."
 glorfindel.0014.a: "I return not in peace but in vigilance."
 glorfindel.0014.a.tt: "You travel back to Imladris"

 glorfindel.0015.t: "Returning to Imladris"
 glorfindel.0015.desc.a: "We pass beneath the trees of [imladris|E] as the first light of dawn filters through the mists. The waters of the Bruinen rush loudly beside us, and the scent of pine and clean earth fills my lungs. For all my years, for all the paths I have walked, there is no place like this.\n\nMy companion walks beside me; silent, yet ever-present. Her gaze takes in the familiar paths with the same wary wonder as mine. We are not the same [elves|E] who once parted from this valley. The road has left its mark upon us, in blood and memory and fire.\n\n[elrondshort|E] greets us at the steps of the Last Homely House, his face lined with quiet relief. We speak no words at first. There is no need. He sees it in our bearing; that the shadow we pursued has been cast back into the dark.\n\nWe are offered rest, and gladly we take it. But already my thoughts wander. The wilds still whisper beyond the mountains, and evil does not sleep for long. Yet for now, we remain. Companions forged by frost and flame, returned from the edge of the world.\n\nLet the hidden vale grant us rest."
 glorfindel.0015.desc.b: "Mist clings to the trees as I cross the last bend in the river, and there, like a dream half-remembered, [imladris|E] opens before me. The hidden vale is unchanged. Treetops rise through morning light, untouched by frost or flame. But I am not the same.\n\nI return changed. The path was long, and the burden mine to bear. I hear no footsteps beside me, no voice in the quiet. Yet I carry with me the memory of those I met, of choices made, and shadows faced. The road shaped me, carved something deeper into the spirit I thought already tempered.\n\n[elrondshort|E] awaits, as ever, with eyes that see more than words could speak. He listens. I tell him what I must, and then the silence settles. The shadow has passed, for now-but its echo lingers still.\n\nI walk the familiar halls and feel the weight lift, slowly. Not gone, but eased. There will be time to reflect. Time to remember. The work is not finished, but the journey has paused.\n\nAnd here, for a moment, I am home."
 glorfindel.0015.a: "I’ve earned this peace - for now."
 glorfindel.0015.b: "I cannot linger. There are others who need help."
