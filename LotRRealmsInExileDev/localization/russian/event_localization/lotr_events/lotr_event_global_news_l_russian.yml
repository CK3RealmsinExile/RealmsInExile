 news_event.0001.desc:0 "[GetTitleByKey('k_tedjin').GetName] is roiling with unrest, as the ambitious new [defender.GetTitledFirstName] seeks to push forward political and religious reforms. In response, the more conservative lords of the confederacy, led by [attacker.GetTitledFirstName] have begun to covertly resist [defender.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]'s efforts at every turn.\n\nWhile we might quickly dismiss the internal squabbles of desert tribesmen, the Tedjin are renowned fighters and mercenaries, and occupy a vital buffer between Umbar and Bellakar. Should [attacker.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] and [attacker.GetHerHis] fellow reactionary lords succeed in overthrowing [defender.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], their ambitions will surely turn South once more.\n\nFinally, the crisis in the Confederacy has reached breaking point. Formal demands for the Reformist Kataj to abdicate sent by the Reactionary Faction have been outright rejected and the two sides are now in open war.\n\nTime is fast running out for interested parties to make their interventions as the future of the Confederacy hangs in the balance."

The determined and bellicose Tûlwangi Rebels have prevailed over the [black_numenorean|E] forces of the [southerndragonarmyadunaic|E], destroying much of their forces.\n\nVast swathes of the [bayoftulwang|E] have been freed from Storm-Host rule, and for the first time in years uncounted the natives of the region are free from foreign lordship. This victory has furthermore shifted the balance of power in the region away from Sauron's influence, undoing much of his work in pacifying the region.\n\nThe sun rises on a new Tûlwang."

Countless villages were put the torch, prisoners massacared, and those even related to potential rebels summarily executed.\n\nLike so many before them, they tried and failed to gain their freedom from the Anbalûkkhôri."

[unifier.GetName], one of the great rulers of those lands, has achieved what many believed impossible, unifying the proud but independent princes of the [balan_lai|E]. The gathering of the council was electric, as the voice of [unifier.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] rang out among the hallowed halls of their meeting place, promising a future of strength, prosperity, and common purpose.\n\nAmid murmurs of both hope and uncertainty, the gathered lords set aside their differences, some through persuasion, others by necessity, as one by one, they swore allegiance to a new imperial order. [unifier.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] now dons the mantle of a ruler not just of one realm, but of all Thâni-Hazâd, an empire born from the ashes of disunity. Yet, beneath the gilded surface, whispers of dissent can still be heard.\n\nWill this new realm thrive and usher in an era of peace and progress, or is it merely the calm before a storm of rebellion and intrigue?"

In a gathering that began with thinly veiled hostility, [dissolver.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] declared the dissolution of the council, casting aside the institution that had kept the balance of power for generations.\n\nAs [dissolver.GetHerHis] words echoed through the chamber, the assembled lords erupted into chaos. Some fled in fear, while others called for blood. The Old Order, with all its tradition and fragile peace, is no more. The once-mighty [balan_lai|E] crumbles as each prince now turns to their own devices, unsure of what authority to follow.\n\nWhat remains of the Thâni-Hazâd stands on a precipice. Will the remaining Princes carve out new dominions in the vacuum of power, or will [dissolver.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] bold gamble lead to a swift consolidation of authority under [dissolver.GetHerHis] rule?"

As [dissolver.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] forces breached the gates of the council’s stronghold, the ruling princes fled or surrendered, and the ancient institution of the [balan_lai|E] dissolved into dust under the weight of conquest.\n\nThe banners of [dissolver.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] now fly over the ruins of an era, and the people of Thâni-Hazâd look toward a future shaped not by their own lords, but by an outsider. Some whisper that this is the death knell for Kharadûnâi rule, while others hope that [dissolver.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] reign might bring a new order and stability after years of infighting and intrigue.\n\nWill the conqueror usher in an age of dominance, or will the fires of rebellion and resistance burn hotter than ever in the ashes of the old council?"
