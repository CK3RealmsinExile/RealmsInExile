 ## Initial Events ##
 goblins.0200.t: "The Mask"
 goblins.0200.desc: "Half-buried in the dirt lies a grotesque mask, hewn from bone or something disturbingly close to it. Its hollow eyes stare up at me, wide and empty, its tusked maw frozen in a silent snarl.\n\nThe moment I lay eyes on it, a strange compulsion takes hold. I want to lift it. To feel its weight. To press it to my face. I do not know why. But the thought of leaving it behind unsettles me deeply.\n\nShould I take it with me... or leave it buried where it lies?"
 goblins.0200.a: "I will take it."
 goblins.0200.a.tt: "Unlocks a special [decision|E]"
 goblins.0200.b: "Best leave it be..."
 goblins.0200.b.tt: "You cast the mask aside"
 
 goblins.0201.t: "The Mask: A Powerful Feeling"
 goblins.0201.desc: "I shove the mask onto my face. Cold... so cold! It bites my skin, like teeth made of frost. Everything spins and then snaps into place. Colours twist. Sounds stretch.\n\nI can hear my own blood. I can hear everything. My heart thumps like war drums. I'm grinning. I think I'm laughing. Or screaming? I don't know! I don't care!\n\nThe mask wants things, and so do I. Yes. Yes! Let them come!"
 goblins.0201.a: "I feel... powerful...!"
 
 goblins.0202.t: "The Mask: Surging Strength"
 goblins.0202.desc: "My bones pop. My skin stretches. It hurts, but it's a good hurt. My arms bulge, my grip tightens... I crush a rock without meaning to. I feel heavy, strong, fast. Faster than I've ever been. I punch the ground and it cracks.\n\nI laugh. The mask hums against my face like it's feeding me. Feeding through me. I was small once. Not anymore. Now they'll run when they see me coming."
 goblins.0202.a: "Hahaha! I am invincible!"
 
 goblins.0203.t: "The Mask: Thoughts of Grandeur"
 goblins.0203.desc: "I was just another [goblin|E]... small, quick, forgettable. Not the biggest. Not the meanest. Just another face in the swarm. But now? Now I see the truth. They scurry and snarl and scrape for scraps... while I rise.\n\nThe mask has shown me what I could be. No... what I am. Smarter. Stronger. Greater. I was made for more. I feel it in every bone. They'll follow me, or they'll fall."
 goblins.0203.a: "Nobody can stop me!"
 
 ### Random Events ###
 goblins.0210.t: "The Mask: Ill-Gotten Gains"
 goblins.0210.desc: "The mask presses cold against my skin, and a strange warmth spreads through my fingers. I close my eyes and suddenly the air hums around me.\n\nFrom thin shadows, coins begin to spill, gold and silver, piling at my feet like a river of riches. I reach out and the treasure flows into my hands as if called by the mask itself. It is not just wealth, it is power, unearned but undeniably mine.\n\nI laugh, the sound ringing sharp and wild, knowing this fortune comes at a price I do not yet understand. The mask pulses, alive, whispering promises of more if I dare to take it."
 goblins.0210.a: "I'm rich!"
 
 goblins.0211.t: "The Mask: A Tasty Meal"
 goblins.0211.desc: "The mask tingles against my face as I wander near the water's edge. Suddenly, a shimmer catches my eye beneath the rippling surface. I reach down and feel the slick, wriggling body of a fat fish, fresh and heavy in my hands.\n\nIts scales glint like molten silver, and the scent of the river fills my nostrils. Hunger gnaws at me, but this prize feels like more than mere luck.\n\nIt feels like the mask is guiding me, providing when I need it most. I smile, ready to feast, grateful for this strange gift from something beyond."
 goblins.0211.a: "Time to dig in!"
 
 goblins.0212.t: "The Mask: Public Embarassement"
 goblins.0212.desc: "I was wandering near the clearing when suddenly everything grew heavy and distant. My thoughts slowed, as if my mind was sinking into a fog. Sounds became dull, vision blurred, and I felt a weight I could not fight. Time slipped past without me noticing.\n\nThen, as if waking from a dream, I looked down and froze. The shame hit me like a hammer — I had relieved myself right out in the open. Faces around me twisted with laughter and disgust.\n\nHow did this happen? I do not remember a thing. What cruel trick is this?"
 goblins.0212.a: "Arghh!"
 
 goblins.0213.t: "The Mask: Blood On My Hands"
 goblins.0213.desc: "I remember speaking sharply with [dead_courtier.GetName], though the words feel distant now, as if spoken by someone else.\n\nSuddenly, a fierce headache seizes me, pounding deep inside my skull. The world twists and blurs; I stagger and close my eyes to steady myself. When I open them again, the room is still and quiet, but something is terribly wrong.\n\nOn the ground lies a body, unmoving, blood staining the floor beneath. My hands shake as I look down, confusion flooding me.\n\nWhen did this happen? How did it come to this? I cannot recall striking a blow. What dark haze has swallowed my memory?"
 goblins.0213.a: "But... when did I...?"
 
 goblins.0214.t: "The Mask: Fiery Devastation"
 goblins.0214.desc: "The hall is filled with the sound of distant crackling, but I sit calmly, unaware of the chaos beyond these walls. The air smells faintly of smoke, though it feels distant and unclear to me.\n\nThen the doors burst open and folk rush in, wild-eyed and shouting. They say they come from a quarter of the city set ablaze, claiming that people saw me starting the devastating fire in [raid_province.GetName] that caused it all?!\n\nI blink in confusion, my mind scrambling to grasp what they mean. I cannot recall anything they accuse me of. My hands rest quietly on my lap, steady and clean, but their accusations ring loud in my ears.\n\nHow could I have done such a thing? An all-consuming blaze rages nearby without my knowing, and the whispers around me grow into a storm. Am I truly to blame, or is something beyond my knowing at work?"
 goblins.0214.a: "The fire is out of control!"
 goblins.0214.tt: "A [building|E] in [raid_province.GetName] is downgraded or destroyed"

 goblins.0215.t: "The Mask: An Ominous Sight"
 goblins.0215.desc: "The stillness of the water draws my gaze, a quiet pool nestled beneath the overhang of a crooked stone. I lean closer, peering at the surface where my reflection should greet me.\n\nBut what stares back is not quite me. The shape is mine, the eyes are mine, but they move without echoing my own. A twitch of the head, a blink too late, a faint smile curling upwards though my face is still.\n\nI freeze. The reflection tilts its head the other way, studying me with a knowing gaze that chills my core. No sound accompanies the moment, only the soft lapping of the water and the heavy thud of my heart.\n\nWhat is this Mask that casts a shadow not just over the face, but the very soul? The image in the water lingers, then slowly fades with the ripples, as if it had never been there and yet somehow, still is."
 goblins.0215.a: "I... saw myself, and yet not."
 
 goblins.0216.t: "The Mask: Cuts and Bruises"
 goblins.0216.desc: "I feel sharp pain along my skin, fresh cuts and bruises cruelly marking my arms and chest. Yet my mind is a fog, blank and confused, unable to recall how I came to this.\n\nWas I attacked by unseen enemies? Or did the Mask claim this damage for its own, carving its sinister mark into me when I wasn't looking? \n\nThe line between my own will and the Mask's twisted power blurs further still. My reflection in the water is fractured, and so too is my sense of self. When did this happen? What horrors am I too afraid to remember?\n\nThe Mask hums softly against my skin: a cold, terrible lullaby that promises there is more to come.
 goblins.0216.a: "When did this happen...?"
 
 goblins.0217.t: "The Mask: At the Pinnacle"
 goblins.0217.desc: "I stand at the mountain's highest peak, the world sprawling beneath me like a conquered realm. The wind bites at my skin, sharp and wild, but I feel only the thrill of triumph surging through me. This is a moment of pride, a moment I should savour.\n\nAnd yet the path is gone from my mind. I recall no climb, no hardship, no effort overcome. Only the Mask, resting on my face, warm with a strange and quiet power.\n\nDid it guide me here? Did I ascend through my own strength, or by some force beyond me?"
 goblins.0217.a: "I don't recall the way up... or down..."
 
 goblins.0218.t: "The Mask: A Cold Breeze"
 goblins.0218.desc: "I awoke to the bite of cold air against bare skin. Stone beneath me, torchlight flickering on cavern walls, and nothing between but the Mask clinging to my face.\n\nMy clothes were gone. Every last scrap.\n\nWhispers echo in my skull, bursts of laughter and jeering cries in the market square. Faces turned. Fingers pointed. No memory led me here. No thread to follow. Just the creeping dread that I was seen like this, stumbling half-mad through the den with nothing to cover me.\n\nDid the Mask do this? Or was it me, lost in its grip? The chill remains, but the shame cuts far deeper.
 goblins.0218.a: "Wh-where are my clothes?"
 
 goblins.0219.t: "The Mask: Untold Story"
 goblins.0219.desc: "#italic "Avenge me!" #!\n\nIt has started as soon as I slipped the mask over my face. "#italic "Avenge me!" #! it utters, over and over again. Unendingly it drones on, sometimes screaming, sometimes whispering. "#italic "Avenge me!" #!\n\nAvenge you? For what? Who are you? How should I know? These questions matter little to the mask. It does not stop, it does not yield.\n\n#italic "Avenge me!" #!"
 goblins.0219.a: "Please... no more..."

 goblins.0300.desc: "PLACEHOLDER This is getting out of hand. I must get rid of this thing! But how should I do it?"

 goblins.0300.b: "I know! I'll gift it to [unlucky_goblin.GetFirstName]..."
 goblins.0300.b.tt: "You will attempt to pass the Mask to [unlucky_goblin.GetName]"

 goblins.0306.desc: "PLACEHOLDER No matter what I try, I can't destroy it! What's this blasted thing made of?"
 goblins.0306.a: "This cannot be happening..."

 ### Mask Lunacy Events ###
 goblins.0280.t: "The Mask: A Certain Urge"
 goblins.0280.desc: "There is a pull. A scratching. A whisper that never stops!\n\nThe Mask... it just lies there, still as stone, yet I hear it. I feel it. Thrumming at the edge of my skull!\n\nI stare. For hours. Maybe longer? I don't blink. I forget to breathe. My fingers twitch. My jaw aches. It wants to be worn. I know it does! Not a command... no, no. It's a craving. A need. Like it's inside me now. Crawling!\n\nThe world dims when it's gone. But when it's close... Oh, when it's close... everything is clear. Too clear. It soothes me. Or maybe... maybe it owns me? I can't tell. I can't!\n\nI only know I need it... I need it now!"
 goblins.0280.a: "Thats... uh... a bit ominous?"
 
 goblins.0281.t: "The Mask: A Powerful Urge"
 goblins.0281.desc: "It will not stop.\n\nThe scratching is louder now. Closer. Inside. The Mask watches me. I know it does. Even when I hide it. Even when I turn away. I feel it smiling.\n\nI wake up reaching for it. I sleep with its weight in my mind. I dream in its voice. My thoughts are not mine anymore. They're echoing, looping, whispering its name.\n\nWhy do I feel hollow when I don't touch it? Why does everything else seem dull and grey? I can't think. I can't eat. I can't breathe right unless it's near. Unless it's mine.\n\nJust one more look. One more touch. Then maybe I'll feel whole again."
 goblins.0281.a: "This cannot be good!"
 
 goblins.0282.t: "The Mask: Psychic Pains"
 goblins.0282.desc: "It will not leave me be.\n\nEven when I shut my eyes, it is there... burned into the dark. I try to think of other things, simple things, safe things... but the Mask carves through them like claws through cloth. It whispers louder now. Not words. Not quite. But meaning. Pressure. Pain.\n\nMy head pounds. My thoughts buckle. I clutch at my skull to hold myself together. But I cannot! It's inside me. Behind my eyes. Beneath my skin.\n\nI can't forget it. I can't fight it. It has made a home in me. And I fear — no — I know it doesn't plan to leave."
 goblins.0282.a: "This is clearly getting out of hand!"
 
 goblins.0283.t: "The Mask: Debilitating Urge"
 goblins.0283.desc: "Why me? Why did it come to me? That cursed thing... that wretched Mask!\n\nMy head is splitting. My bones ache. My skin itches from the inside. Every breath is a battle. It claws at me even when I sleep... Especially when I sleep. I feel it watching. Waiting.\n\nWas I chosen? Cursed? Tricked?! What did I do to deserve this torment? I didn't ask for it. I didn't want it! But now it won't let me go.\n\nI can't eat. I can't rest. I can't even think! The Mask burns in my thoughts like a brand. I beg for silence... for peace... but it only laughs.\n\nWhy did it come to me? Why won't it stop?!"
 goblins.0283.a: "This torment... is unbearable..."
 
 goblins.0284.t: "The Mask: Crippling Pains"
 goblins.0284.desc: "It hurts... It hurts!\n\nNo more thoughts... no more anything! Just the Mask... always the Mask...\n\nI can't think. I can't... see without it screaming inside my head! The walls bend. The floor breathes. My teeth itch. My blood hums. I laugh and I cry and I don't know which is which anymore!\n\nThe Mask watches. It whispers. No... it sings! Beautiful and broken. I want to rip it off my face but not yet... Not yet. NOT YET!\n\nEverything else is gone. Gonegonegone! There is only the Mask now. Only it. Only it... ONLY IT!"
 goblins.0284.a: "ARRGHGHHRHBLLLRLR!"
