 gundabad.0200.t:0 "Revitalisation of the Orcs"
 gundabad.0200.desc:0 "For far too long, the Orcs of the North have forgotten their past. They wander about not different with wild dogs, only to be helplessly slaughtered by the men that have grown in strength since the mishap at Dale! Guided by the great Ulûkai and the blood of Azog that grants [ROOT.Char.GetHerHim] great power and wit so desperately needed, [ROOT.Char.GetFirstNameRegnal] has once again cemented Orcish supremacy in the Anduin Vale.\n\nNow that we finally established secure control over the various bridges and fords across the Anduin, the wrath of Mount Gundabad will be felt by all throughout the North. Already warg riders are scouting for potential targets. May our raids swiftly befall any who dare to oppose us, men or elves!"
 gundabad.0200.a:0 "Great terror shall ride forth from Gundabad once more!"

 gundabad.0201.t:0 "Master of the North"
 gundabad.0201.desc:0 "Bolg's folly was more than avenged when the Orc horde overran not only the Mannish kingdom of Dale, but also laid waste to the damned Greenwood. Now truly broken, the vile Men and Elves are on the run, their strongest fortifications laid low by our great trolls, their people scattered to be the prey of wild beasts and warg riders, and their riches emptied all for the lord of Gundabad. With this newfound wealth, our boys could certainly use some fresh meat instead of maggoty bread, amongst other things.\n\nNow that the Tarks will be without any assistance from the North, the eventual assault on Minas Tirith seems all the more imminent. Let them tremble in fear, for their inevitable doom is coming!"
 gundabad.0201.a:0 "Our lordship over these lands shall ensure for a hundred generations!"
