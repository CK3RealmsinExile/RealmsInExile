#   realms_galadhrim_filler.100: "Странные символы"
#   realms_galadhrim_filler.100_desc: "Разведчики докладывают, что на самой границе были обнаружены странные символы на коре мэллорнов. Они не понимают, как это могло произойти под их надзором, а меня это повергает в ярость.\n\nПрежде чем злоумышленники вернутся, мы должны предпринять меры."
#   realms_galadhrim_filler.100.a: "Я лично буду нести дозор!"
#   realms_galadhrim_filler.100.a_tt: "Вы лично присоединяетесь к стражам, чтобы поймать преступника и разобраться с ним."
#   realms_galadhrim_filler.100.b: "Нужно удвоить патрули на границе."
#   realms_galadhrim_filler.100.b_tt: "Пусть у вас нет времени, чтобы обеспечить полную безопасность своей державы, мы можете хотя бы усилить охрану."
#   realms_galadhrim_filler.100.c: "Дело, конечно, серьёзное, но сейчас есть вопросы поважнее."
#   realms_galadhrim_filler.100.c_tt: "У вас нет времени, чтобы вникать во все мелкие дрязги в королевстве."

#   ### JOIN SENTRIES IN WATCH ###

#   realms_galadhrim_filler.101: "Дозор"
#   realms_galadhrim_filler.101_desc: "Когда мир погружается во тьму ночи, начинается мой дозор. К счастью, ждать долго не приходится. Я слышу, как хрустят ветки под ногами злополучных авторов этих символов.\n\n Стоит ли мне напасть на них сверху, рискуя тем, что части из них удастся сбежать? Или мне следует приказать разведчикам напасть на них, рискуя получить ранения, но гарантированно захватить всех врагов?"
#   realms_galadhrim_filler.101.a: "Устроим засаду. Прямое нападение слишком опасно."
#   realms_galadhrim_filler.101.a_tt: "Возможно части врагов удастся сбежать, но вы не готовы рисковать жизнями своих разведчиков."
#   realms_galadhrim_filler.101.b: "Мы не можем позволить им уйти."
#   realms_galadhrim_filler.101.b_tt: "Мы готовы рискнуть своим здоровьем, но не можем отпустить ни одного из них."

#   ### AMBUSH ORCS THAT PAINTED PAINTINGS ###
  
#   realms_galadhrim_filler.102: "Shock and Awe"
#   realms_galadhrim_filler.102_desc: "The sentries have managed to ambush a group of orcs wandering around the border. My men are capable, but these pests have done grievous harm to my borders.\n\nDo I rush in myself, or leave it to my men?"
#   realms_galadhrim_filler.102.a: "Come, to the battle!"
#   realms_galadhrim_filler.102.a_tt: "You fight for your life amidst the melee."
#   realms_galadhrim_filler.102.b: "My men are more than capable enough - no rush."
#   realms_galadhrim_filler.102.b_tt: "You let your sentries handle the orcs."

#   ### FLAMES DESTROYED TREES ###

#   realms_galadhrim_filler.103: "Fiery Days"
#   realms_galadhrim_filler.103_desc: "My marshal has brought me word of a terrible event that has taken place in one of our glades. Apparently a few of our mallorn trees were burned down due to the actions of orcs. [marshal.GetSheHe|U] blames it on my carelessness as [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsName].\n\nClearly [marshal.GetSheHe] doesn't understand the pressure that I've been dealing with recently."
#   realms_galadhrim_filler.103.a: "There was nothing else to do."
#   realms_galadhrim_filler.103.a_tt: "Fortunately, only trees were lost, although it could have been a lot worse."

#   realms_galadhrim_filler.104: "Battle Beneath the Trees"
#   realms_galadhrim_filler.104_desc: "I arrive to the sounds of a battle, but it is one that is already won. My warriors clash with orcs under the trees, pushing them back and making them drop the torches they had sought to use to set the forest ablaze. The ground is stained with orcish blood, and they swiftly turn to retreat, only to find arrows in their backs."
#   realms_galadhrim_filler.104.a: "Let none of them survive..."
#   realms_galadhrim_filler.104.a_tt: "You and your guards join the sentinels in hunting down the last of the orcs."

#   ### CAPTAINS DUEL ( YOU AND ENEMY CAPTAIN ) ###
  
#   realms_galadhrim_filler.105: "The Orc Captain"
#   realms_galadhrim_filler.105_desc: "As I enter the skirmish, I notice a rather large orc dominating the field. Even his fellow orcs would rather face my sentries than stand too close to him and his bloodthirst.\n\nHe finally notices and starts walking towards me, bellowing a challenge."
#   realms_galadhrim_filler.105.a: "Today is the day you die!"

#   ### END OF BATTLE - WIN ###

#   realms_galadhrim_filler.106: "Victory"
#   realms_galadhrim_filler.106_desc: "With a final decisive push, my men have triumphed over the Orcs.\n\nNow all that remains is cleanup. The forest shall heal in time, but for now, an increased watch is the order of the day."

#   realms_galadhrim_filler.107: "Death comes for all"
#   realms_galadhrim_filler.107_desc: "You fought against the champion fiercely, yet it was not enough. As the blade descends for the final cut, you think on all you have done and all you have left undone..."
#   realms_galadhrim_filler.107.a: "Have I done enough?"
#   realms_galadhrim_filler.107.a_tt: "You are slain by the orc champion, leaving your kingdom in mourning."

#   ### END OF BATTLE - DID NOT JOIN IN ###
#   realms_galadhrim_filler.108: "Whisperings of Cowardice"
#   realms_galadhrim_filler.108_desc: "As I stand amidst the aftermath of the skirmish, I can hear some of the sentries whispering among themselves about how I delayed coming to join the battle yet ordered them to fight.\n\nWas it wrong of me to order them to risk their lives, or should I instead have fought beside them?"
#   realms_galadhrim_filler.108.a: "The [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsName] is too precious to risk in mere skirmishes."

#   realms_lasgalendrim_filler.100_desc: "I have received word that one of the Great Elks in the forest has fallen ill, no doubt caused by one of Sauron's servants. The once-proud and beautiful beast can no longer stand nor sustain itself, save for the help and desperate care of my Glad-tir-edhel.\n\nDue to its sacredness to my people, this is seen as a grave insult, and I must quickly take action before it is too late."
#   realms_lasgalendrim_filler.100.a: "There is nothing we can do."
#   realms_lasgalendrim_filler.100.a_tt: "You decide that the elk has fallen too ill and that you shall kill it to end its suffering."
#   realms_lasgalendrim_filler.100.b: "Seek Radagast the Brown, he will help."
#   realms_lasgalendrim_filler.100.b_tt: "You send your most nimble men to seek Radagast the Brown, to secure his help in healing the elk."
#   realms_lasgalendrim_filler.100.c: "It is merely another beast."
#   realms_lasgalendrim_filler.100.c_tt: "You have far more important matters to attend to than care for a beast."

#   ### KILL THE ELK YOURSELF ###

#   realms_lasgalendrim_filler.101_t: "Too Late"
#   realms_lasgalendrim_filler.101_desc: "As I inform the surrounding elves of my decision, they undergo a visible change. All of them are struck with grief, yet some shed tears and others vent their anger on the nearby ground.\n\nI have taken this decision; therefore, it is only right that I put the magnificent animal out of its misery."
#   realms_lasgalendrim_filler.101.a: "May you rest easy from now on."

#   realms_lasgalendrim_filler.102_desc: "Radagast arrives in all haste, shoving my courtiers out of the way in his haste to get to the fallen elk. When he finally stops at my side, he groans in dismay at the state of the animal, yet spares no time.\n\nNo more than a few days have passed until the Great Elk stands on its own again, healed by the Istari's power."
#   realms_lasgalendrim_filler.102.a: "We are ever grateful, Radagast."
#   realms_lasgalendrim_filler.102_tt: "You enlisted the help of the wizard Radagast to heal the Great Elk."

My scouts report that they believe it to be some sort of terrible beast, stalking traders and travelers from the shadows.\n\nMy councillors [ROOT.Char.GetCouncillor('councillor_marshal').GetName] and [ROOT.Char.GetCouncillor('councillor_steward').GetName] are insistent that the beast must be slain, and soon; otherwise, it may cause even more chaos on the trade route."
#   realms_lasgalendrim_filler.200.a: "[ROOT.Char.GetCouncillor('councillor_marshal').GetName] shall deal with this"
#   realms_lasgalendrim_filler.200.a_tt: "You send your marshal to deal with the beast, in hope of stopping it from further disrupting the trade."

#   realms_lasgalendrim_filler.200.b_tt: "You go to slay the beast, preventing it from harming any of the traders."

#   realms_lasgalendrim_filler.201_desc: "News has reached my court of [ROOT.Char.GetCouncillor('councillor_marshal').GetFirstNamePossessive] death.\n\nThis has thrown my court into mourning, but we can at least take comfort in the fact that [ROOT.Char.GetCouncillor('councillor_marshal').GetHerHisMy] death did not come without cost. The dark beast is dead, along with any comfort that could have been taken in it."
#   realms_lasgalendrim_filler.201.a: "I should have gone..."

#   realms_lasgalendrim_filler.202: "Trouble in the Woods"
#   realms_lasgalendrim_filler.202_desc: "As my hunting party draws closer and closer to the sleeping beast, it suddenly stirs. Its eyes cracking open, it gazes at me and my men with malice - it had expected such an attack! Rousing swiftly, its powerful form knocks several of my guards away into the brush. \n\nNow separated from my guard, panic setting in, the beast gives out a great roar, leaping towards me. I have to react quickly - what do I do?"
#   realms_lasgalendrim_filler.202.a: "I stand my ground and try to slay the beast!"
#   realms_lasgalendrim_filler.202.a_tt: "You try to slay the fell beast that has been terrorizing your realm."

#   realms_lasgalendrim_filler.204: "Slain Beast"
#   realms_lasgalendrim_filler.204_desc: "Standing over the corpse of the beast, I breathe a sigh of relief for having survived the foe and ridding my realm of its threat. Now my people can once more travel and trade without fear of being massacred by the beast while on the road.\n\nMy soldiers and the courtiers that came with me stare at me with wonder in their eyes, likely due to the skill I displayed when fighting the beast. They cheer my name, and chants of "[ROOT.Char.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] the Beast-Slayer!" resound throughout the temporary camp we'd set up. One of my courtiers takes up his travelling harp to pick up a tune, even as my men break out the wine! As the celebration gets underway and I bask in the victory, I can only think - well won and deserved!"
#   realms_lasgalendrim_filler.204.a: "A great victory indeed!"
#   realms_lasgalendrim_filler.204.a_tt: "You have slain the beast, and now it is time to return home."

#   realms_lasgalendrim_filler.205: "The Price of Cowardice"
#   realms_lasgalendrim_filler.205_desc: "Managing to dodge the first attack, I swiftly beat a hasty retreat towards my rallying guardsmen. But as a result, I have turned my back on the beast, and before I can reach them, a shadow looms over me.\n\nI suddenly feel a great weight crushing me into the earth, and all I can feel is claws ripping into my back and the distant sounds of my men rushing towards me with a great battle cry."
#   realms_lasgalendrim_filler.205.a: "Мне стоило сохранять осторожность."
#   realms_lasgalendrim_filler.205.a_tt: "The beast attacks you from behind and severely injures you, but your men manage to fight it off and prevent your death."

My marshal, [ROOT.Char.GetCouncillor('councillor_marshal').GetName],  has advised me to investigate it, lest any Haradrim survivors escape into the countryside and cause trouble.\n\nAs we reach the location of the stranded ship, one of my scouts tells us that he has found a survivor and has bound him in case he tries to escape."

He has entertained me with wild tales of creatures that he has encountered in the far south and the endless sea of sand which one encounters in the Dune Sea.\n\nOur conversation has revealed to me that even though our people have ancient rivalries, we are not that different, and I get the feeling that [survivor.GetNameNoTooltip] feels the same."
#   realms_gondor_filler.102.a: "Is this the beginning of a friendship?"
#   realms_gondor_filler.102.a_tt: "You begin to suspect that [survivor.GetNameNoTooltip] shares a lot of your own ideals."
