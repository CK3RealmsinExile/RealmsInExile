Try it!", [orc_participant.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] shouts at me while laughting intensely.\n\nAt first, it is hard to swallow and my throat feels like its burning... but then a great feeling of heat spreads around my body, and suddendly, I feel new strength and energy in my muscles. Just one drop of the brew was enough to make me want to run laps around the hall."
