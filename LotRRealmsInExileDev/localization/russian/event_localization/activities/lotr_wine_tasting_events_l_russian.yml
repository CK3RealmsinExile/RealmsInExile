 ### VINEYARD VISIT ###
 wine_tasting.0050.t:0 "Vacation Plans"
 wine_tasting.0050.desc:0 "It’s been too long since I’ve had an opportunity to take a break from my busy life. Many members of the noble classes of [dorwinion|E] have estates out in the countryside where they can relax and spend time away from the city, and I am no exception.\n\nVacationing at a wine estate isn't just for petty pleasures, however. These are also places of agronomic and botanical experimentation, and where proper, cultured people gather to engage in scholarly discourse.\n\nI think it's time for me to take a break and partake in a [ROOT.Char.GetInvolvedActivity.GetShortName] in [ROOT.Char.GetTravelPlan.GetData.GetNextDestination.GetProvince.GetName]. There is much fun to be had on these excursions, no matter one's personality and interests!"
 wine_tasting.0050.a:0 "I want to spend some time by myself."
 wine_tasting.0050.a.tooltip:0 "If you go on vacation to your estate by yourself, you are more likely to lose [stress|E]. If you wish, you might also have the chance to learn about the latest developments in agronomy and botany to improve your realm."
 wine_tasting.0050.b:0 "I shall invite the finest of the realm!"
 wine_tasting.0050.b.tooltip:0 "If you go on vacation to your estate with a group, you will have better chances to gain [prestige|E] and [piety|E]. You might also improve the [opinions|E] invitees have of you, and the image you exude as a ruler."

 wine_tasting.0060.t:0 "Arrival at the Vineyard"
 wine_tasting.0060.desc:0 "After some preparation, I've finally arrived at my vineyard estate in the countryside for my excursion. For the next days I’ll have the whole manor to myself so I can relax and take a break.\n\nOf course, just because I’m by myself doesn’t mean I can’t engage in productive activities. I could wander the countryside around my estate, see how the vineyards are growing, tend my gardens or even ask my servants to teach me a thing or two about viticulture. As such, if I want to, I could check on how my sponsored projects are doing. Perhaps I could gain some new insights that impress my peers or even help improve my realm.\n\nOf course, perhaps this vacation should just be for relaxation and recreation."
 wine_tasting.0060.a:0 "What’s the latest from the surrounding vineyards?"
 wine_tasting.0060.a.tooltip:0 "You may potentially gain new insights into managing your realm and viticultural matters."
 wine_tasting.0060.b:0 "I’m curious what my gardeners are up to."
 wine_tasting.0060.b.tooltip:0 "You may potentially gain new insights into how plants can personally benefit you."
 wine_tasting.0060.c:0 "Ah, let's just sit back and relax!"
 wine_tasting.0060.c.tooltip:0 "You will lose much more [stress|E], but be deprived of a chance to gain other bonuses."
 wine_tasting.0061.t:0 "The Vacation Ends"
 wine_tasting.0061.desc:0 "All good things must come to an end. Though I’ve enjoyed my time at my estate these past few days, I must return to my duties as the [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] of these lands.\n\nStill, This break from the stresses of life and ruling has been great fun, and I have certainly savored it. Going to the countryside like this always rejuvenates a [ROOT.Char.GetWomanMan]’s spirit, and I look forward to the next opportunity I have to do this."
 wine_tasting.0061.a:0 "I’m sure I’ll be back sooner than later."
 wine_tasting.0062.t:0 "Viticulture at My Estate"
 wine_tasting.0062.desc:0 "There is a myriad of things to do in a vineyard. The grapes are harvested, processed, stored and turned into wine and raisins. Thus, although I am spending a lot of my time at my vineyard's main manor to relax, I am interested in seeing how things are doing at the rest of my estate.\n\nThe overseers and a few scholars specializing in viticulture, whom I previously hired to provide guidance for these operations, accompany me as I traverse the fields and orchards. Perhaps I should ask them what they’ve recently learned from their work. The information could come in handy later, and help me in my responsibilities as [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip]."
 wine_tasting.0062.a:0 "I wonder how vine yields and production have been?"
 wine_tasting.0062.a.title:0 "You gain insights about viticulture!"
 wine_tasting.0062.b:0 "I want to learn how they turn the grapes into raisins."
 wine_tasting.0062.b.title:0 "You gain insights about raisin production!"
 wine_tasting.0063.t:0 "Gardening at My Estate"
 wine_tasting.0063.desc:0 "Vineyards in the countryside often also have sizable gardens inside or near the main estates, and mine is no exception. Flowers, shrubs, trees, and other plants - both those native to this land, as well as exotic ones from faraway lands - are distributed across my estate; adorning walkways and benches, as well as fountains and ponds.\n\nAs well as enjoying my gardens, I also want to see what my staff are up to. The gardeners, laborers, and scholars specializing in botany not only maintain my gardens, but sometimes experiment a little to learn more about these plants.\n\nPerhaps they would have unique insights which could come in handy in many ways, including improving my palace gardens to make them even more impressive and majestic."
 wine_tasting.0063.a:0 "What are the latest gardening trends?"
 wine_tasting.0063.a.title:0 "You gain insights about gardening!"
 wine_tasting.0063.b:0 "I'm sure the scholars would have insights about useful properties of these plants."
 wine_tasting.0063.b.title:0 "You gain insights about herbs and medicine!"
 wine_tasting.0064.t:0 "Relaxing at My Estate"
 wine_tasting.0064.desc:0 "While there are plenty of interesting things I could be doing at my estate, such as discussing how the vineyards are doing with my overseers or investigating how the operations are running, unofficially I’m here for one main reason, and that is to relax.\n\nIt is a pleasant experience; having a few good meals -alongside the finest wine, of course- and napping liberally throughout the day, taking walks in the garden and lounging in the shade, and engaging in a few simple pleasures like reading."
 wine_tasting.0064.a:0 "Life is good."
 wine_tasting.0064.a.title:0 "You are remarkably well-rested!"
 
 
 
 ### WINE TASTING ###
 wine_tasting.0070.t:0 "The Wine Tasting Begins"
 wine_tasting.0070.desc:0 "I arrived a few days early at my vineyard estate to make sure that everything was ready and that the final preperations were made. As the first guests start to arrive, I graciously welcome them as the host, before showing them inside.\n\nFor the next few days, in addition to tasting the finest wines my vineyards have produced, we’ll enjoy all manner of amusements in this lovely villa. Some hosts want to dazzle their guests with splendid views of the manor and surrounding area; meanwhile others of a more cultured disposition might enjoy intellectual discussions - such as on the botanical or viticultural practices of these estates or poetry recitations. Others yet might simply want to feast and have a good time.\n\nOf course, I have already decided what to do."
 wine_tasting.0070.a:0 "Let’s enjoy the beauty of the gardens and vistas."
 wine_tasting.0070.a.tooltip.1:0 "You will gain [prestige|E] OR [piety|E], and your estate might become well-known for their beauty and aesthetic charm."
 wine_tasting.0070.a.tooltip.2:0 "Introverted, reserved guests may enjoy this activity more, and have a better [opinion|E] of you after the wine tasting is done."
 wine_tasting.0070.b:0 "Let’s engage in poetry and intellectual discourse."
 wine_tasting.0070.b.tooltip.1:0 "You will gain [piety|E], and your estates might become well-known for attracting learned, eloquent scholars and poets."
 wine_tasting.0070.b.tooltip.2:0 "Intellectual, thoughtful guests may enjoy this activity more, and have a better [opinion|E] of you after the wine tasting is done."
 wine_tasting.0070.c:0 "Let’s feast and forget about the worries of life!"
 wine_tasting.0070.c.tooltip.1:0 "You will gain [prestige|E], and your estates might become well-known for hosting plenty of lively, fun parties."
 wine_tasting.0070.c.tooltip.2:0 "Extroverted, sociable guests may enjoy this activity more, and have a better [opinion|E] of you after the wine tasting is done."
 wine_tasting.0071.t:0 "The Wine Tasting Begins"
 wine_tasting.0071.desc:0 "I’ve finally arrived at [host.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] vineyard estate in the countryside for our excursion. As some of the other guests arrive, the [host.GetWomanMan] [host.GetHerselfHimself] comes out of the main residence to greet us and welcome us inside.\n\nThough many of our high society own these kinds of villas, myself included, it is always interesting to see those of other nobles and aristocrats. Besides the main event, the wine tasting itself, some focus on delighting visitors with views of their beautiful gardens, lovely architecture, or awe-inspiring countryside vistas. Others cultivate an air of sophistication by inviting skilled poets to come engage in intellectual and literary pursuits. Others, meanwhile, prefer to entice learned scholars to stick around to learn about botanical or viticultural practices.\n\nWho knows what amusements we’ll enjoy in the coming days?"
 wine_tasting.0071.a:0 "I wonder, what will our itinerary be?"
 wine_tasting.0072.t:0 "The Wine Tasting Ends"
 wine_tasting.0072.desc:0 "All good things must come to an end. While the last few days at my estate have been quite fun and prestigious, my guests and I have to return to our daily lives at some point. We have a final grandiose banquet on the last night, crowned by the opening of an especially rare vintage, and in the morning, we depart.\n\nNonetheless, I am certain we all had a merry time, and it was a nice diversion from the stresses of daily life."
 wine_tasting.0072.a:0 "I look forward to the next excursion!"
 wine_tasting.0073.t:0 "The Wine Tasting Ends"
 wine_tasting.0073.desc:0 "All good things must come to an end. While the last few days at the estate have been quite fun, I and the others who have joined [host.GetTitledFirstName] at [host.GetHerHis] estate for many days of recreation and leisure have to return to our daily lives at some point. We have a final grandiose banquet on the last night, crowned by the opening of an especially rare vintage, and in the morning, we must depart.\n\nNonetheless, I had a great time, and it was a nice diversion from the stresses of daily life."
 wine_tasting.0073.a:0 "Perhaps I’ll host something like this at one of my estates."
 wine_tasting.0074.t:0 "My Estate Gardens"
 wine_tasting.0074.desc:0 "For the past few days, I have let my guests tour some of the best and most brilliant gardens on my estate. I have done much to ensure that these gardens are filled with all manner of wondrous plants, from exotic, dazzling, and vivid flowers to imposing and majstic trees that offer ample shade. I also make sure to point out some of the fountains I’ve installed, whose splendid waterworks are thanks to the small canals that carry fresh, clear water from the nearby river into my manor.\n\nIt seems my efforts have paid off; as we chat and relax in the gardens, listening to the melodies of the birds, their amazement and enjoyment is readily apparent."
 wine_tasting.0074.a:0 "I'm glad they're enjoying the gardens!"
 wine_tasting.0074.a.title:0 "Your guests spread word about your gardens!"
 wine_tasting.0075.t:0 "[host.GetTitledFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] Estate Gardens"
 wine_tasting.0075.desc:0 "For the past few days, [host.GetTitledFirstName] has been showing us some of the best and most brilliant gardens at [host.GetHerHis] estate. It is clear that [host.GetSheHe] is very proud of [host.GetHerHis] gardens, and for good reason.\n\nEven when I first arrived at the manor, I noted some of the gardens from afar in passing. Yet to see them up close is another matter altogether! These gardens, are filled not only with plenty of spectacular plants - from strange but alluringly vivid flowers hailing from faraway lands, to tall, mighty trees that seem to hail from another Age - but they feature also cool, refreshing fountains, quaint little canals, and shaded ponds teeming with frogs and fishes.\n\nEach day we relax in the gardens, chatting and enjoying our time here."
 wine_tasting.0075.a:0 "I love socializing in such delightful places!"
 wine_tasting.0075.a.title:0 "Your enjoy socializing in the estate gardens"
 wine_tasting.0075.b:0 "So many butterflies and birds and flowers! I must see them all!"
 wine_tasting.0075.b.title:0 "Your enjoy inspecting the estate gardens"
 wine_tasting.0076.t:0 "A Cultured Estate"
 wine_tasting.0076.desc:0 "Alongside my guests, I have also invited a few local scholars and poets to our excursion at my estate. Whether my relaxing gardens, dining rooms, baths, or various courtyards and gathering halls, I see many of my guests engaging in all manner of intellectual activity with each other.\n\nSome debate the finer points of current politics, or theological and philosophical issues. Others have poetry contests, where they recite beautiful and ancient poems to each other, whether about the world around them or about each other (from satirical to flattering). Others of a more quiet disposition, meanwhile, enjoy games of chess with one another or reading any number of works from my extensive library."
 wine_tasting.0076.a:0 "The atmosphere here is certainly very cultured."
 wine_tasting.0076.a.title:0 "Your guests spread word about your cultured inclinations!"
 wine_tasting.0077.t:0 "A Cultured Estate"
 wine_tasting.0077.desc:0 "Our host, [host.GetTitledFirstName], has encouraged us to participate in various intellectual activities in the past few days at [host.GetHerHis] estate. The mark of a great [host.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip], after all, is one who is surrounded by people of culture and learning, and [host.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] has even invited a few local scholars and poets to join us on this excursion.\n\nThus, while this Wine Tasting isn’t the rowdiest one I’ve seen, it’s a delight, at least for those who are more intellectually inclined. Every day, many guests debate topics ranging from political issues to theology and philosophy. Others work on their literary skills, and compete in impromptu poetry contests. Those who are of a quieter disposition, meanwhile, enjoy games of chess or reading works from [host.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] extensive library."
 wine_tasting.0077.a:0 "These intellectual discussions are illuminating!"
 wine_tasting.0077.a.title:0 "You gain some intellectual insights"
 wine_tasting.0077.b:0 "Poetry has never been more rewarding."
 wine_tasting.0077.b.title:0 "You win some poetry contests"
 wine_tasting.0077.c:0 "Perhaps I should try a game of chess, or peruse the library."
 wine_tasting.0077.c.title.1:0 "You found a good book in the library"
 wine_tasting.0077.c.title.2:0 "Your chess matches are interesting, even if you don't always win"
 wine_tasting.0078.t:0 "Partying at the Estate"
 wine_tasting.0078.desc:0 "When #italic some#! people go to relax at an Estate with others, they might participate in more productive activities like discussing convoluted scholarly issues, exploring the countryside, or conducting botanical experiments. My guests and I, however, have no time for such tedious pursuits!\n\nWhile my guests are free to do as they please (within reason), we’re here to have fun. I’ve made an effort in the past few days to provide my guests with plenty of fine food and drink so that we may indulge ourselves to our heart’s content, listen to energetic and delightful musical performances, and socialize with such an exciting gathering of people who know how to enjoy life."
 wine_tasting.0078.a:0 "We’re here for a good time!"
 wine_tasting.0078.a.title:0 "Your guests spread word about your amazing parties!"
 wine_tasting.0079.t:0 "Partying at the Estate"
 wine_tasting.0079.desc:0 "[host.GetTitledFirstName] has been throwing us banquet after banquet while we’ve been here at [host.GetHerHis] Estate, always accompanied by the finest vintage. While this might not be the classiest feast I’ve ever attended, but there is a certain charm about having a party in a nice manor in the countryside.\n\nWhile we are certainly free to engage in other activities, I hardly seem to find time for myself! In the past few days, I’ve mostly been eating good food, drinking good wine, enjoying delightful musical performances, or socializing with fellow guests. Many gathered here seem to be having a good time, and without a doubt, I am one of them!."
 wine_tasting.0079.a:0 "Is it time for the next wine already?"
