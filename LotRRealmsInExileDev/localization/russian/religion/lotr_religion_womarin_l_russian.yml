 womarin_religion_desc:0 "The religion of the Dragon-lords of the Farthest East were rooted in the worship of the Golden Skymother (Soelâsi: Utumkôdur) and her purported children and descendants. These religions did not tend to claim divine universality, but instead tended to focus on the place of Utumkôdur as divine mother and guardian of the Womaw people. Utumkôdur, for her part, was more than happy to act as a protector goddess, for she found the love and reverence of her 'children' as worthy of hoarding as any jewel. In this respect, she could be at times a jealous goddess."

 faith_nlkum_kadir_desc:0 "Among the pirates of the Utter South, the lessons of two dragons are spoken. "Nlkum" the Gilded Sun Dragon of order and "Kadir" the Sea Dragon of freedom, who taught the Kadiri to live apart from regimented society. Leading them on a grand journey out of the lands of their former masters.\n\n The Freed of Kadir follow the lessons passed down by the benevolent Sea Dragon. Giving to and taking from who they wish, when they wish. Holding an averse resistance to any sort of restriction of freedom and continuing the grand journey of freedom. Yet the wise understand that there are lessons to be learned from the opressive Nlkum, for only through some semblance of order can the fleets of Kadiri keep to their ways and fend off those who seek to command them."
