 faith_northmen_desc:0 "The ancient faith of the [northmen|E] is rooted in the pantheon of the Freas, which the [numenorean|E]s identified with the [valargods|E]. Freas translates roughly to 'The Great Ones', which includes in their ranks the following:\nAfodfréa, the Warrior\nAilgra, Lady of the Hearth,\nBaumya, Lord of the Hunt, known also as Béma\nBlostma, the wild maiden\nNefrea, the Deathgiver\nNeorth, Lord of the Waters\nUrdur, Mistress of Heaven\nVaxa, the Earth-Mother\nWolcenfréa, Lord of the Sky\n\nTogether these divine spirits govern the world and taught mankind how to live."

 faith_woodmen_desc:0 "The Widumanna practise a primitive faith rooted in the forest that provides for all their needs. They are primarily followers of [bemacharacter|E], the Woodman name for the Valar [oromecharactershort|E]. \nLong ago, the Woodmen split from their plain-dwelling kin and settled the woods. With time, their way of worship changed, with some influence from the [lasgalendrimelves|E]. They are known to treat nature with great reverence and see it as their sacred duty to protect the wild forests of [mirkwood|E].\n\nMore recently, many of them have started to view [radagastcharacter|E] as their spiritual leader due to his strong connection with nature, though he very rarely if ever partakes in any ceremonies."

 faith_dale_desc:0 "Long influenced by the neighboring [dwarves|E] of [erebor|E] and the [elves|E] of [greenwoodshort|E], the [northmen|E] of the [dale|E]-lands show the least [gondorian|E] influence of all the [northmen|E] faiths. \n\nThe faith of the Celdin and the Dalish highlands tends to primarily revolve around two [valagod|E] in particular - [aulecharacter|E] and [oromecharactershort|E], though they are known to the Dalemen via the names Mahal and Tauron. Tauron the hunter and bow-master is the patron of warriors and hunters, the rural lands of the Celduin. Mahal is the patron of craftsmen, tradesman, and the cities that form the heart of Celduin's prosperity. While all the [valargods|E] are revered, it is these two who are held most dear to the folk of the Celduin."

 faith_dorwinion_desc:0 "The faith of the folk of [dorwinion|E] is rooted in the ancient blessing their land received when three of the [entwives|E] chose to make the lower Celduin river their abode. These three, known as the Earth-maidens, where named as the emissaries of Aldena, the Earth-mother, who gives bounty of the earth. By their influence, the land of [dorwinion|E] grew prosperous and fertile, and even long after their disappearence, the folk of [dorwinion|E] remain devoted followers of their teachings of careful but bounteous cultivation of the earth. Though they know of the other [valar|E] through the [entwives|E], [avari|E], and [dwarves|E], none are more loved more dearly and fiercly than [yavannacharactershort|E], whom they refer to as Aldena."

 faith_blue_sect_desc:0 "The Fiskurkyn, meaning "Kindred of the fish" in the ancient tongue of [rhovanion|E] are a Marine Cult that emerged when sailors, fishers and merchants around the Inland [seaofrhun|E] started to revere [ulmocharacter|E], whom they know as Neorth, as well as the Inland Sea itself, above the other [valargods|E].\n\nDeep beneath the Waves, the Lord of the Sea blesses the creatures of water and sends his scaled servants to guide and nourish man. Because of this, fish are often used for divination and minor fish deities are called upon for aid and counsel. Among the [northmen|E] faithful they are mostly known for being highly supersticious, for surely a dark fate will await those who set sail under an unfavorable omen."

 faith_rohan_orome_desc:0 "The Éored of [bemacharacter|E] refers to those amongst the [rohirrim|E] who focus exclusively on the Great Rider. They believe that [bemacharacter|E] leads those with his favour in great hunts unrivalled in mortal lands. The adherents of this sect are amongst the most militant of the [rohirrim|E], desiring nothing less than to prove their strength in arms and riding. Hunts, feasts, and feats of strength are common amongst the brotherhoods of these men."

Her maternal care for the earth and the fields wins admirers far and wide, and the farmers look to her for blessings on their crops. Great harvest festivals and fairs dot the land, the people rejoicing in the bounty of mother earth - and mother [foldewyncharacter|E]."

 faith_framling_adherent_plural:0 "Followers of Béma"
 faith_framling_desc:0 "In their long isolation, what few of the [eothed|E] remained in the upper reaches of the [anduinvale|E] by necessity became a hardened people. In the harsh north, the ancient, key figure of [bemacharacter|E] came to assimilate many of the other traditional [northmen|E] gods and understandings of the [valargods|E], moving to, if not the sole God, the only major one invoked.\n\nLoving to His people, harsh to those who would threaten them, the Horselord stands vigilant and stalwart as the guardian of the North."

 ####### Rhevain Religion #######

 rhevain_religion_desc:0 "The Rhevain are the [northmen|E] who have not fully absorbed the religious traditions and knowledge of the [dwarves|E], [elves|E], or [faithful|E]. They remain a more superstitous and simplistic culture, often believing in malevolent spirits and being wary of Elves, but are hardy and true."
 
 ### Leofring Fae Court###
 faith_fey_court:0 "Fey Court of Foldewyn"
 faith_fey_court_adj:0 "Fey Court"
 faith_fey_court_desc:0 "Leofring veneration revolves around the king and queen of the Fey, Béma and [foldewyncharacter|E]. Béma ever has been a friend of mankind and taught the Leofrings to ride and gifted them their herds. He is kindly and quick to forgiveness, though often wandering and absent as well. While Béma roams afar, his wife Foldewyn, mighty in her own right, reigns over the fey in her court of starlight.\n\nDwelling in the forest of the mist, the Leofring believe that Foldewyn bears a fickle mood, proud, and slow to forgive the mistakes of mankind. Her favour is perilous to acquire, though rich when gotten; for few come again from her forest, and not unchanged. Priestesses intercede with her fey on mankind's behalf, hoping to earn her favour and not her ire. If her ire is raised, men have been said to walk into the mist, enchanted, never to be seen again."

But his power was not that of his brother, and he and his people withered, and his halls, once fair and green, because a desolation. The dark fey rose again in dread visage, spiteful towards the living that thrived while they withered. \n\nNow darkness comes forth from that hill, a choking malice upon all who would dare approach it. The restless fey have turned fell and taken up twisted forms. Bony hands stretch forth to grasp the living and take our life for their own. Only through grand sacrifices can they be appeased, lest the malice of their dread king fall upon us, and our ruin come."
