 faith_corsair:0 "Azrîyamanoi Creed" # The Spirits of the Sea
 faith_corsair_adj:0 "Azrîyamanoi"
 faith_corsair_adherent:0 "Azrîyala"
 faith_corsair_adherent_plural:0 "Azrîyalai"
 faith_corsair_desc:0 "Among the superstitious sailors of the Umbarean coast, a cult of two great sea spirits exists, known as the Azrîyamanoi. Malíciam, the lord of the deep, is a harsh lord, capricious in his actions and his deeds. He acts seemingly at random, and can flip between being a dear friend and a deadly foe in an instant. His wife, Uyuninêz, lady of calm waters, is a restraining force on his tempers and wills, but is the weaker of the two. To her sailors cry and make burnt offerings, and among the corsairs it is custom to bear a shrine to both of the great spirits on every ship.\n\nArising from the [numenorean|E] (and subsequent [black_numenorean|E] and [dunedain|E]) dominance of the region of [umbar|E] and the natives that lived there, the worship of Malíciam and Uyuninêz is a corrupted fusion of the [haradrim|E] fear of the sea god (Malíciam), and the Númenórean reverence for the [maiargods|E] of [ulmocharacter|E], [ossecharacter|E] and [uinencharacter|E]."

faith_kolir_adherent_plural:0 "Kôlirai"
faith_kolir_desc:0 "The Veneration of the Kôlir is a strange faith which arose in Mardrûak during the chaos of the later Third Age, arising as a mix between the folkloric worship of the Haradrim and the Bellakari Batân an-Izindi, which gained popularity amongst the Bellakarean Adûnai remnants of Mardrûak following the retreat of authority.\n\n The Kôlirî worship a pantheon of deities, who have inhabited the world since the beginning, and live in the uttermost west. From time to time they come among men, and their lives and deeds shape the course of history. These are worthy of praise and emulation."
