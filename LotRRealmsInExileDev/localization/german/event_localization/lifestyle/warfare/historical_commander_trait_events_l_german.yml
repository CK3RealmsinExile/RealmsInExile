 historical_commander_trait.0001.desc: "While studying the tactics of ancient wars I was [ROOT.Char.Custom('surprised_reaction')] to learn about the start of the Dagor Bragollach:\n\n#F After years of siege to his fortress at Angband, Morgoth, the First Dark Lord, sent forth terrible rivers of fire and lava from Thangorodrim and poisonous fumes from the Iron Mountains. In the wake of these fires came the now fully grown Glaurung, the Balrogs, and the armies of orcs in numbers that elves had never conceived. Thus began the Battle of the Sudden Flame!#!"
 historical_commander_trait.0001.a: "I will annihilate my enemies, as Morgoth did!"

 historical_commander_trait.0002.t: "Disaster at the Gladden Fields"
 historical_commander_trait.0002.desc: "While studying the tactics of ancient generals I was shocked to learn about the tragedy of Isildur's final battle.\n\n#F In the early Third Age, marching home in triumph after the fall of Sauron, Isildur and a retinue of 200 soldiers were ambushed by a large orc horde numbering in the thousands. While a Dírnaith (wedge formation) would have torn the orc horde asunder, the terrain was rugged and left Isildur no choice but to form a Thangail (shield-wall). The formation held for some time until the orcs assumed a crescent formation and surrounded the brave Dúnedain. After his sons fell in combat, Isildur was advised to retreat, but died to orc arrow fire.#!"

 historical_commander_trait.0003.t: "The Great Armament"
 historical_commander_trait.0003.desc: "While studying the tactics of ancient generals I continue to be amazed by the exploits of the ancient Númenóreans.\n\n#F In the late Second Age, King Ar-Pharazôn built the most impressive fleet ever seen. His goal was to claim the immortality of the Valar themselves on Aman. As they surrounded the island of Tol Eressëa and their armies landed on the hill of Túna, the Valar summoned Eru, who plunged the entire fleet into a great breach that broke the very form of Arda. Meanwhile, on land, Ar-Pharazôn and his army were buried an avalanche of falling rocks.#!"
 historical_commander_trait.0003.a: "Eru himself had to intervene to stop the glorious fleet!"
 historical_commander_trait.0003.b: "So many years of splendid constructions... Lost in an instant."
 historical_commander_trait.0003.c: "The greatest of spoils, immortality. His ambition was more than justified!"
 historical_commander_trait.0003.d: "Why waste time studying such nonsense?"

 historical_commander_trait.0004.t: "The Fall of Gondolin"
 historical_commander_trait.0004.desc: "As I read the tales of the First Age, I stopped to study the Fall of [gondolin|E].\n\n#F For nearly seventy-five years, Turgon and his people secretly built Gondolin. Thanks to the Seven Gates of the Hidden Path, the city lived 400 years of prosperity and remained hidden from the eyes of the Dark Lord. However, the traitor Maeglin, Turgon's nephew, was captured outside the city, and through torture revealed the location of the city. Morgoth's forces subsequently sacked and razed the city.#!"
 historical_commander_trait.0004.a: "Turgon ignored Ulmo's warning! His pride was his doom."
 historical_commander_trait.0004.b: "Seven gates to defend the Hidden Path! Had it not been for the traitor..."
 historical_commander_trait.0004.c: "Morgoth's ingenuity in abducting Maeglin was superior to all defences."
 historical_commander_trait.0004.d: "The greatest of betrayals, there is nothing to learn from this story!"

 historical_commander_trait.0005.t: "Resistance in the Lhûn"
 historical_commander_trait.0005.desc: "While studying the tactics of generals in the Second Age I became contemplative upon learning about the resistance of the elves in the River Lhûn.\n\n#F In S.A. 1695 Gil-galad, the High King of the Noldor in Middle-earth, requested aid from Númenor when Sauron invaded Eriador. Tar-Minastir sent a great fleet commanded by the admiral Ciryatur, but it took five years to arm and arrive. Meanwhile, the elves of Lindon resisted Sauron's onslaught with a valiant defence on the Lhûn, until the Númenórean reinforcements allowed them to turn the tide.#!"
 historical_commander_trait.0005.a: "Devotion to [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetFaith.HighGodName] will give us strength in these dark times."
 historical_commander_trait.0005.b: "It was their mastery of the fords that allowed them to resist."
 historical_commander_trait.0005.c: "#EMP Strength#! is as important as #EMP patience#!."
 historical_commander_trait.0005.d: "Why celebrate the tragic loss of so many lives?"

Er erkannte wahrhaftig, dass unsere Stärken Schnelligkeit und Beweglichkeit sind!\n\nBilge und seine Armee sollten später noch die Kitan und die Xi im Namen Tengris zermalmen!"  #~TR~
