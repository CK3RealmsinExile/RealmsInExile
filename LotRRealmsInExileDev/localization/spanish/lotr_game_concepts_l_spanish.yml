 game_concept_bloodofnumenor:0 "Sangre de Númenor"
 game_concept_bloodofnumenor_desc:0 "La Sangre de Númenor es la sangre de los descendientes de los Numenoreanos, los habitantes de la isla de [numenor|E]. Los [valargods|E], por el valor de los Padres de los Hombres en la [concept1stage|E] y Guerra de la Cólera, les dio una esperanza de vida tres veces mayor que la de los hombres menores y una tierra en la que vivir en paz y prosperidad. Pero con el tiempo la dicha de [numenor|E] disminuyó, porque el miedo a la muerte se apoderó de ellos, y el abandono de su sabiduría y amistad con los Eldar, la arrogancia y la codicia por la vida eterna les trajo la perdición.\n\nEn el juego, la Sangre de Númenor otorga importantes bonificaciones a la longevidad y las estadísticas. A diferencia de los rasgos [congenital|E], estos rasgos de linaje no se pueden "actualizar" a un nivel superior y siempre corren el riesgo de perderse. Las posibilidades de un niño de heredar el rasgo de mayor linaje de sus padres están influenciadas por el carácter moral de los padres. Un parentesco más virtuoso resulta en mayores posibilidades de retener el rasgo más fuerte de la Sangre de Númenor. Por el contrario, los personajes moralmente malvados o corruptos tienen más probabilidades de ver desaparecer los beneficios de su prestigiosa línea de sangre."

Los Edain establecieron el Reino de [numenor|E] en esta era y alcanzaron el apogeo de su poder y dicha.\n\nFue a principios del 1500 de esta época que [annatarcharacter|E] llegó a las puertas de [eregion|E] y se hizo pasar por un emmisario de los [valargods|E], ganándose la amistad de [celebrimbor|E]. Así se crearon los Grandes Anillos y, a su vez, Sauron creó el [oneringshort|E], el [rulingring|E]. Luego se produjo la guerra entre Sauron y los Elfos, que terminó con la derrota de Sauron después de que una gran hueste viniera de [numenor|E].\n\nMás adelante en la era, los [numenoreans|E], cada vez más orgullosos y envidiosos de los Eldar, hablaron en contra de la [banofthevalar|E]. Con el tiempo, [sauroncharacter|E] fue tomado cautivo en [numenor|E], y desde adentro finalmente los corrompió en una rebelión abierta, que culminó en el [akallabeth|E].\n\nLos supervivientes de los [faithful|E] de [numenor|E], los Eldar y los Enanos se unieron en la Guerra de la Última Alianza y juntos derrocaron a [sauroncharacter|E], aunque el [rulingring|E] no fue destruido.

Esta era estuvo dominada por el ascenso y la decadencia de los Reinos en el Exilio, [gondor|E] y [arnor|E].\n\n[arnor|E] finalmente se dividió en tres reinos, siendo al final destruidos por el Reino de Angmar. [gondor|E] creció en fuerza y ​​poder para traer de vuelta la memoria del [numenor|E] de antaño, pero ahora lleva mucho tiempo en declive, aunque sigue siendo fuerte.\n\nLos Elfos se preocuparon cada vez más por conservar las tierras que ya poseían y, en general, dejaron de intentar expandirse. Los Enanos continuaron prosperando en sus salones de montaña hasta la caída de [khazaddum|E], cuando el Daño de Durin se despertó y mató a Durin VI, lo que llevó a la eventual fundación del [ereborrealm|E].\n\nEn los días menguantes de la Tercera Edad, [sauroncharacter|E] se prepara de nuevo para atacar a los Pueblos Libres, y la esperanza descansa en el filo de la navaja. Por último, el valor del más pequeño de los seres, los [hobbits|E], deshizo a [sauroncharacter|E] y todas sus obras. El portador del anillo y los poseedores de los [threeringsofelvesshort|E] finalmente navegaron hacia el [uttermostwest|E], y así terminó la Tercera Edad de Arda."
 game_concept_fourthage:0 "Cuarta Edad"
 game_concept_fourthage_desc:0 "La Cuarta Edad de Arda (C.E.) comenzó cuando los Portadores del Anillo y los Tres cruzaron el mar hacia [valinor|E]. Su comienzo estuvo marcado por el surgimiento de un reino Dúnedain resurgente bajo el rey Elessar, pero nadie puede decir cómo terminó..."

 game_concept_elderdays:0 "Días Antiguos"
 game_concept_elderdays_desc:0 "Los Días Antiguos, durante la [secondageshort|E] y la [thirdage|E], se refieren apropiadamente a los tiempos antes del final de la [firststage|E]. En ese contexto, los Días Medios fueron la Segunda y la Tercera Edad, mientras que los Días Jóvenes fueron el Dominio de los Hombres.\n\nSin embargo, en la Cuarta Edad, el término comenzó a aplicarse a todas las Edades anteriores, como la época anterior al Dominio de los Hombres y la disminución de los Elfos y otras razas. Aragorn, por ejemplo, se refirió a sí mismo como el último Rey de los Días Antiguos."

The Stoors grew facial hair and had an affinity for water, boats and swimming and wore boots; the Fallohides were fair, tall and slim, an adventurous people, friendlier and more open to outsiders. Finally, the Harfoots were the most numerous and instituted the living in burrows. In later days the Harfoot traits became the "norm".\n\nThe Hobbits are first known to have dwelled in the Vales of [anduin|E]. Some remained there, but the majority migrated westward, eventually coming to settle in the Shire during the reign of Argeleb II of Arthedain. \n\nHobbits have a life span somewhat longer than Men of non-[numenorean|E] descent, averaging between 90 and 100 years. The time at which a young hobbit "comes of age" is 33. \n\nHobbits are by nature of gentle disposition, though often provincial in outlook; they are fond of an unadventurous bucolic life of farming, eating, smoking pipe-weed, socializing and talking about genealogies. Yet do not underestimate them, for they are hardy in times of trial, and show a fierce resolve when roused.\n\n#TOLKIENQUOTE "I am in fact a Hobbit (in all but size).

To evil end shall all things turn that they begin well; and by treason of kin unto kin, and the fear of treason, shall this come to pass. The Dispossessed shall they be for ever. Ye have spilled the blood of your kindred unrighteously and have stained the land of Aman. For blood ye shall render blood, and beyond Aman ye shall dwell in Death's shadow.

And those that endure in Middle-earth and come not to Mandos shall grow weary of the world as with a great burden, and shall wane, and become as shadows of regret before the younger race that cometh after.

With golden roof and silver floor and runes of power upon the door. The light of sun and star and moon in shining lamps of crystal hewn, Undimmed by cloud or shade of night there shone for ever fair and bright.\n\nThere hammer on the anvil smote, there chisel clove, and graver wrote; There forged was blade, and bound was hilt; the delver mined, the mason built. There beryl, pearl, and opal pale, and metal wrought like fishes' mail, Buckler and corslet, axe and sword, and shining spears were laid in hoard.\n\nUnwearied then were Durin's folk; Beneath the mountains music woke: The harpers harped, the minstrels sang, and at the gates the trumpets rang. \n\n The world is grey, the mountains old, the forge's fire is ashen-cold; No harp is wrung, no hammer falls: the darkness dwells in Durin's halls; The shadow lies upon his tomb, in Moria, in Khazad-dûm.
