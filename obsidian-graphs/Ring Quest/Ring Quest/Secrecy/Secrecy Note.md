### What is it?
Secrecy is a measure of how concealed the Fellowship is from the searching eye of Sauron. 
### What does it do at a high level?
Secrecy determines how well the Fellowship and the Ringbearer remain hidden from Sauron’s gaze. As **secrecy decreases**, Sauron's **agents are better able to intensify their hunt**, making **encounters more frequent**, **travel more dangerous**, and ultimately making the temptation of the Ring harder to resist. 
### What is it in code?
Secrecy is a numerical variable that's stored on the Ringbearer (or alternatively, the LAAMP that the ringbearer sits in). I'd suggest we normalise this between a range of 0 and 100, with 0 being totally exposed and 100 being totally concealed.
### How might this work in more detail?
I'd suggest that we present and use secrecy in the following ways (very similar to how I suggest we use corruption!):

- ***Secrecy Checks (Random Rolls Against Secrecy Level)*** - Secrecy checks determine whether the Fellowship remains undetected during key narrative moments of their journey. These are randomised rolls against the current secrecy value, modified by situational factors. Think of this like a duel or 'skill check' in vanilla.
- ***Secrecy Gates (Unlocking or Restricting Content Based on Secrecy Level)*** - Certain options, locations, and events are locked or triggered based on secrecy thresholds.
- ***Secrecy Levels*** - We can split the 0-100 scale into a number of secrecy levels that apply constant modifiers that impact travel difficulty, enemy awareness, and possibly corruption mechanics. These effects will persist as long as secrecy remains within a given threshold.

### By what means can secrecy to change over time?

Secrecy should be a dynamic variable, rising and falling based on player choices, environmental factors, and major events. For example:

- **Using the ring** (large loss of secrecy)
- **Staying in non-good locations too long** (gradually increasing losses of secrecy)
- **Corruption of the fellowship** (this might be too much pushing in the same direction so not sure!)
- **Passing through enemy occupied lands**
- **Successful search actions by Sauron's agents like the Nazgul**
- **Resting in safe havens**
- **Taking more hidden paths**
- **Intervention of powerful allies**
- **Misdirection, making Sauron believe the ring is elsewhere**

_Secrecy is_ _**the**_ _key lever for Sauron too, who will aim to take actions to reduce the fellowship's secrecy to reveal the ringbearer and place them in more and more perillous situations._ 
### What strategic considerations might this prompt in a player?

- Players must actively manage secrecy, rather than expecting it to passively regenerate. Players can't always reset secrecy, so avoiding detection is key to success.
- There is an implicit risk-reward balance that this creates - e.g. should I use the ring to escape a potentially lethal situation at the risk of increasing Sauron's awareness of where I am? Should I take a shorter path through enemy lands, reducing the amount of time the ring's influence can play on the party, or a longer but more secluded path?

### Other thoughts
We could switch the definition of this around to be something more like 'Exposure', 'Detection', or 'Peril' if we wanted it to be better aligned with Corruption (i.e. high number is bad, low value is good) rather than them going in different directions.
