# Community Culture Utility

# Auto-patcher Functionality

- If you are using CCU with a set of mods with different languages/heritages than vanilla, you will need to edit the mod's language/heritage files and then run the patcher.

1. Add parameters beginning with `heritage_group`, `language_group`, and `language_family` to the heritage and language files in the CCU mod folder. Every heritage should have a heritage group parameter, and every language a language group and family.
2. Download golang from: <https://golang.org/dl/.> To verify it's installed correctly open up command prompt and enter `go version`. If you get a version number back then everything is working.
3. Navigate to the `ccu_scripts` directory in CMD and type `go run .`
4. All done! The program will direct its outputs to the CCU mod folder, and the in-game debug function will let you know if you missed anything.
