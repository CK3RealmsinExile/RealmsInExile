[h1]Return of the Crusader King[/h1]
G’day and welcome to the Realms mod for Crusader Kings III, Paradox’s great grand strategy game. I am part of an incredible team that has heeded the call for adventure! With modders from previous Paradox titles in Imperator: Rome, Europa Universalis IV and Crusader Kings 2, alongside brand new modders who have shown incredible talent, together we are building a map of Middle-earth, full of the diverse characters and cultures seen in J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings. It is a wonderful thing that we have succeeded in this.

[QUOTE]“I wisely started with a map, and made the story fit
(generally with meticulous care for distances).”[/QUOTE] – J.R.R. Tolkien.

The map of Middle-earth that we have created is one of the most detailed of any LotR video game, it is the combined work of BoneLorde, Jaime-san and myself. Meanwhile, the legendary Owlcoholic has forged the body of Sauron as he appears as a character in Realms. The trio, Vierwood, Jaime-san and VectorMaximus have worked on the extensive histories and events of Middle-earth. There is new music, coat of arms, buildings, portraits and more, crafted by members of the Realms team.

The first release showcased [b]The Riders of Rohan[/b], beset on three fronts by the wizard Saruman, Dunlending Wildmen and Leofring bandits. The second release now features [b]The Siege of Gondor[/b], against Sauron there is little hope of victory. Invading from the southern lands are the warlords of the Haradrim and the Black Lords of Umbar. The starting year is [b]3000 of The Third Age[/b]. Time enough to set in motion The War of the Ring and witness the Return of the King.

[QUOTE]Realms in Exile refers to the three kingdoms that formed after the destruction of the isle of Numenor. These are Gondor, Arnor and Umbar. Gondor features in the third book of The Lord of the Rings. It is ruled by the stewards of Minas Tirith, as their king was lost in a duel with the Witch King of Minas Morgul. Arnor is the lost realm of the north, Aragorn is chieftain of its few survivors. Umbar was once a city of the Númenóreans at the height of their power in Middle-earth, now it is a mighty haven of corsairs.[/QUOTE]

[h1]Features[/h1]
Our development cycle will change after Realms 2.0 so that we have more, smaller updates. With Realms 2.1 there is new content for Mordor and the Uruks. The features of Realms 2.2 will be announced soon. Yet we won’t be adding large regions and new races between versions, the elves are planned for Realms 3.0, which will include Lothlórien and Mirkwood.

[h1]Join the team![/h1]
The Realms in Exile team is scouting for modders, artists and writers. If you are enthusiastic about LotR and Paradox Interactive's Crusader Kings III, then we would love for you to join our team. Your contribution may be large or small, every single character decision or sprawling event tree will help to fill in the spaces between the words. Your passion might be in the Realms in Exile (who are Gondor, Arnor and Umbar), the Horse Lords of Rohan, the retaking of Moria by Balin, or perhaps further afield in distant Khand or frozen Forodwaith.

If you are interested then we have a role for you. You can contribute by showcasing your works on our [URL=https://discord.gg/FKr4Zbr]Realms in Exile Discord[/URL] community.
